accord antipodal label observation non vertex vertex non pendant vertex vertex vertex shift otherwise remain unchanged vertex shift interchange observation vertex moreover exists vertex proof accord scheme vertex arrangement implies scheme vertex arrangement hence conclude exists vertex due similarity proof exist satisfy correctness algorithm mapping define algorithm antipodal label lemma vertex
