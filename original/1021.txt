In this article, we study the completion time of the PUSH-PULL variant of rumor spreading, also known as
randomized broadcast. We show that if a network has n nodes and conductance ϕ then, with high probability,
PUSH-PULL will deliver the message to all nodes in the graph within O(logn/ϕ) many communication rounds.
This bound is best possible. We also give an alternative proof that the completion time of PUSH-PULL is
bounded by a polynomial in logn/ϕ, based on graph sparsification. Although the resulting asymptotic bound
is not optimal, this proof shows an interesting and, at the outset, unexpected connection between rumor
spreading and graph sparsification. Finally, we show that if the degrees of the two endpoints of each edge in
the network differ by at most a constant factor, then both PUSH and PULL alone attain the optimal completion
time of O(logn/ϕ), with high probability.

1 INTRODUCTION
Rumor spreading, also known as randomized broadcast or randomized gossip, is a well-known
distributed algorithm. Starting with one source node with a message, the algorithm proceeds in a
sequence of synchronous rounds with the goal of broadcasting the message, i.e., delivering it to
all nodes in the network. In each round, every node that knows the message selects a neighbor
uniformly at random to which the message is forwarded. This is the so-called PUSH strategy. The
PULL variant is symmetric. In each round, every node that does not yet have the message selects a
neighbor uniformly at random and asks for the information, which is then transferred to the node
provided that the queried neighbor possesses it. Finally, the PUSH-PULL strategy is a combination of
both: In each round, every node selects a random neighbor to perform a PUSH if it has the message,
or a PULL if it does not have it.
Simplicity and effectiveness are among the many virtues of rumor spreading, making it an ideal
candidate for quick dissemination of information inside a network. The algorithm has been extensively studied, since these three strategies were introduced by Demers et al. [12]. Naturally,
one of the most studied questions concerns the completion time, i.e., how many rounds it takes to
disseminate the information to all nodes in the graph, assuming a worst-case source.
Typically, this question has been approached on a case-by-case basis by giving careful estimates
for particular classes of graphs. For instance, when the network is the complete graph we know
that PUSH informs every vertex within log2 n + lnn + O(1) rounds almost surely [20, 33]. Other
classes of graphs for which rumor spreading has been analyzed include hypercubes, constant degree graphs, and a large variety of random graphs (see Section 2 for more details).
Our approach here is quite different. Rather than focusing on special classes of graphs, we want
to identify a set of necessary and/or sufficient conditions for rumor spreading to be fast in any
given network satisfying such conditions, where by “fast” we mean that the completion time is
poly-logarithmic in the size of the network with high probability. In this work, we make a step
in this direction by providing a general sufficient condition for rumor spreading to be fast: high
conductance.
The first result of this article is to show that if a network has n nodes and conductance ϕ then,
with high probability, the completion time of PUSH-PULL is O (logn/ϕ) . This bound is optimal, for
there are graphs of conductance ϕ and diameter Θ(logn/ϕ). The proof of this bound is based on a
decoupling of the operations of PUSH and PULL. We show that, once the rumor reaches a vertex of
maximum degree, every remaining vertex is informed within O(logn/ϕ) many rounds with high
probability by means of PULL alone. There is a clear symmetry between PUSH and PULL that can be
exploited to show that the probability of spreading the message from a vertex u to another vertex
v within t rounds via PULL is the same as that of spreading the message in the opposite direction,
from v to u, within the same t rounds, via PUSH. Therefore, the argument above also shows that,
starting from any source, a maximum degree vertex will be informed within O(logn/ϕ) many
rounds with high probability by using PUSH alone. Taken together, these two bounds for PUSH and
PULL give the optimal O(logn/ϕ) bound for PUSH-PULL.
The second result of this article is an alternative proof showing that the completion time of
PUSH-PULL is bounded by a polynomial function in logn/ϕ. Unlike the previous approach, which
is based on a decoupling of PUSH and PULL, this approach analyzes the PUSH-PULL process as a
whole. It is based on what we consider to be an interesting and, at the outset, surprising connection
between rumor spreading and the spectral sparsification theory. This connection is used to show
that a small number of PUSH-PULL rounds (polynomial in logn/ϕ) expands the volume of the
set of informed nodes by a factor of (1 + Θ(ϕ2)), with high probability. In turn, this implies that
with high probability, starting from any source, after a number of rounds of PUSH-PULL that is
poly-logarithmic in n and polynomial in ϕ−1, every node is informed. The resulting bound on the
completion time is sub-optimal, but we believe that the proof remains interesting. In a broad sense,
it draws a connection between the theory of spectral sparsification and the speed with which
diffusion processes make progress in a network. This could potentially lead to further insights
beyond the present work and is worth exploring.
The above bounds hold for neither PUSH, nor PULL, when taken in isolation. Perhaps the simplest
counterexample is a star of n nodes. The star has maximum conductance, but PUSH takes at least
n − 1 rounds to complete, regardless of the source, while a standard Coupon Collector’s argument

shows that Θ(n logn) many rounds are needed with high probability. Moreover, a basic expectation
argument shows that when a leaf is the source, PULL requires n many rounds, on average. See also
Reference [8] for examples of preferential attachment graphs with high conductance in which the
two strategies are proven to be slow.
The final result of the article is to show a simple sufficient condition for the optimal O(logn/ϕ)
bound to be attained with high probability by PUSH and by PULL alone: For each edge in the graph,
the degrees of its two endpoints differ by at most a constant factor.
One of the motivations for our work comes from social networks. Loosely stated, we are looking
for a theorem of the form “Rumor spreading is fast in social networks.” There is, however, no universally accepted definition of social networks. One way to circumvent this difficulty is to look for
properties that are enjoyed by social networks and see whether they imply that rumor spreading is
fast. The empirical evidence available suggests that social networks have high conductance [29].
Furthermore, this is true for preferential attachment models of social networks such as the one
proposed by Mihail et al. [30]. Thus, our results can be considered as a possible explanation of
why epidemic processes resembling rumor spreading spread virally in social networks.
We should note that the PUSH-PULL process has some sociological justification. PUSH corresponds to communicating in an active fashion, e.g., texting a message with a mobile phone or
sending an email to a specific recipient. PULL on the other hand corresponds to, e.g., reading a
tweet or a post on the wall of a Facebook account. Thus, PUSH-PULL seems to be a reasonable first
approximation to model the spread of viral information in the age of the Internet.
The work presented here has been the first to show a connection between rumor spreading
and graph expansion properties that, intuitively, should ensure fast dissemination.1 This line of
research has generated considerable follow-up work on the relationship between expansion properties and rumor speeding which we now know runs very deep. Following our work, optimal
bounds for rumor spreading in terms of vertex expansion have been obtained [22, 23, 35], and extensions of the bounds with conductance and vertex expansions have been proposed to dynamic
graph settings [24]. Other works have looked for general bounds for the completion time of rumor
spreading without any dependence on conductance, showing that O(D + polylog(n)) rounds are
sufficient, where D is the diameter of the graph (and hence a trivial lower bound on the completion
time) [5, 26]. Still, these results rely on conductance, in the sense that they show that every graph
can be partitioned into regions each of which is of high conductance, and within which rumors
spread fast for the reasons elucidated in this work.
The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the relevant literature. Section 3
introduces some common concepts and definitions to be used in the rest of the article. Section 4
presents the optimal O(logn/ϕ) bound for PUSH-PULL. Section 5 presents a sufficient condition
for this bound to hold when PUSH and PULL operate by themselves. Finally, Section 6 shows the
connection between rumor spreading and graph sparsification.
2 RELATED WORK
The literature on rumor spreading is huge and we confine ourselves to what appears to be more
relevant to the present work.
Clearly, at least diameter-many rounds of rumor spreading are needed for the message to reach
all nodes. On the other hand, Feige et al. [18] have shown that O(n logn) rounds are sufficient with
1This article is the result of a series of intermediate steps [9, 10, 21]. Reference [10] was the first to show the connection
between rumor spreading and conductance. By using a different approach, Reference [9] followed up with an almost tight
solution to the problem. Finally, Reference [21] improved the latter approach introducing new ideas, obtaining a tight
solution.

high probability for any connected graph with n nodes. The problem has been studied on a number
of graph classes, such as cliques, hypercubes, bounded-degree graphs, and various types of random
graphs (see, for instance, References [18, 20, 33]). More recently, there has been a lot of work on
“quasi-regular” expanders, i.e., expander graphs for which the ratio between the maximum and
minimum degree is constant. It has been shown in different settings [3, 14, 15, 34] that O(logn)
rounds are sufficient for the message to spread throughout the graph. Our work can be viewed as
an extension of these studies to graphs of arbitrary degree distribution. Observe that many realworld graphs (e.g., Facebook, the Internet, etc.) have a very skewed degree distribution, i.e., the
ratio between the maximum and minimum degrees is very high. In most graph models for social
networks this ratio is polynomial in the order n of the graph.
Mihail et al. [30] have studied the edge expansion and conductance of graphs that are very
similar to preferential attachment graphs and showed that their edge expansion and conductance
are constant. For “genuine” preferential-attachment graphs, Chierichetti et al. [8] showed that
rumor spreading finishes in O(log2 n) rounds. A subsequent article by Doerr et al. [13] improved
that by showing a tight bound of O(logn) rounds, and, moreover, if one is interested in informing
only n − o(n) nodes, then one has to wait for just O(logn/ log logn) many rounds.
Fountoulakis et al. [19] studied another class of graphs with power-law degree distribution, for
which they showed that O(log logn) rounds suffice with high probability to informn − o(n) nodes.
Boyd et al. [4], and Mosk-Aoyama and Shah [32] have shown that high conductance implies that
non-uniform (over neighbors) rumor spreading is fast. By non-uniform we mean that, for every
ordered pair of neighbors i and j, node i will select j with probability pij for the rumor spreading
step (in general, pij  pji ). This result does not extend to the case of uniform probabilities studied
in this article. In our setting (but not in theirs), the existence of a non-uniform distribution that
makes rumor spreading fast is a rather trivial matter. A graph of conductance ϕ has diameter
bounded by O(logn/ϕ). Observe that in a synchronous network, it is possible to elect a leader in
O(logn/ϕ) many rounds and set up a BFS tree originating from it. Assigning probability 1 to the
edge between a node and its parent gives the desired non-uniform probability distribution.
Giakkoupis et al. [25] have shown an O(logn/ϕ) bound for a “low-randomness” variant of PUSH
on regular graphs. In their algorithm, the random choices of nodes are not independent but rely
instead on a pseudorandom generator whose random seed is attached to the message.
Another standard measure of graph expansion that has been studied in connection with rumor
spreading is vertex expansion [22, 23, 35]. The main result of this line of work is a tight bound of
O(logn · log Δ/α) on the number of rounds for PUSH-PULL to spread a message with high probability, for any graph with vertex expansion α and maximum degree Δ. This bound is incomparable to
the O(logn/ϕ) bound, as the vertex expansion is incomparable to conductance for general graphs.
An interesting application of the O(logn/ϕ) bound has been in the design of a new class of
information dissemination protocols [5, 6, 26]. These protocols rely on the fact that PUSH-PULL
spreads information fast in subgraphs of high conductance, and they combine PUSH-PULL with
more sophisticated rules on how each node chooses the neighbor to contact in a round. These
new protocols achieve fast information spreading for broad families of networks, and some of
these protocols achieve for all graphs time bounds that are close (within polylogarithmic factors
or polylogarithmic terms) to the network diameter.
For the message complexity of PUSH-PULL, we observe first that it has been determined precisely
only for very special classes of graphs (namely, cliques [28] and Erdös-Rényi random graphs [17]).
Apart from that, given the generality of the graph class we consider, it is not possible to obtain a
non-trivial upper bound on the number of messages—where the trivial upper bound is the number
of rounds times n. Consider, for instance, the “lollipop graph.” Fix ω(n−1) < ϕ < O(log−1 n), and
suppose that we have a path of length ϕ−1 connected to a clique of size n − ϕ−1 = Θ(n). This graph

has conductance O(ϕ). Let the source be an arbitrary node in the clique. After Θ(logn) rounds each
node in the clique will have the information with high probability. Further it will take at least ϕ−1
steps for the information to be sent to each node in the path. So, at least n − ϕ−1 = Θ(n) messages
are pushed (by the nodes in the clique) in each round, for at least ϕ−1 − Θ(logn) = Θ(ϕ−1) rounds.
Thus, the total number of messages sent will be Ω(nϕ−1). Observing that the number of rounds
is Θ(ϕ−1 + logn) = Θ(ϕ−1), we obtain that the number of rounds times n is (asymptotically) less
than or equal to the number of transmitted messages.
We also note that one cannot give fault-tolerance guarantees (that is, the ability of the protocol
to resist to node and/or edge deletions) based only on conductance. A star has high conductance,
but failure of the central node destroys connectivity.
3 PRELIMINARIES
In this section, we introduce some, mostly standard, notation and provide some basic technical
lemmas to be used in the analysis.
Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph with n = |V | vertices. For a vertex v ∈ V , ΓG (v) denotes
the set of v’s neighbors in G, and degG (v) := |ΓG (v)| is the degree of v. By ΔG we denote the
maximum degree of G. For a set of vertices S ⊆ V , we let
ΓG (S) :=

v ∈S
ΓG (v) − S.
We define the volume of set S ⊆ V to be the sum of the degrees of the vertices contained in S,
volG (S) :=

v ∈S
degG (v).
Observe that volG (V ) = 2 · |E|. Given two disjoint sets of vertices A, B ⊆ V , we let cutG (A, B) be
the set of edges with one endpoint in A and the other in B.
Definition 1 (Conductance [27]). The conductance of a non-empty vertex set S in graph G is
ϕG (S) := |cutG (S,V − S)|
volG (S) .
The conductance of G is the minimum ϕG (S), over all sets S for which vol(S) ≤ volG (V )/2,
ϕG := min
S ⊆V, 0<vol(S )≤vol(V )/2
|cutG (S,V − S)|
volG (S) .
In all the notations above we will omit G whenever the graph is clear from the context.
We say that an event occurs with high probability, abbreviated as w.h.p., if it happens with probability 1 − n−Ω(1)
.
Let B(k,p) denote a binomial random variable with parameters k and p, i.e., B(k,p) is the number
of successes among k independent trials each of which succeeds with probability p. We will use
the next standard lemma, which can be found in Reference [1, Lemma 3.1].
Lemma 2. Let Z1,...,Zk be random variables with values in some arbitrary domain, and let
X1,...,Xk be binary random variables such that Xi = Xi (Z1,...,Zi ), for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Let X := k
i=1 Xi . If Pr(Xi = 1 | Z1,...,Zi−1) ≥ p, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k, then for any t,
Pr(X < t) ≤ Pr(B(k,p) < t).
The following lemma gives simple bounds on the number of coupons collected in the Coupon
Collector’s process, within a given number of trials. We denote that number by C(k,t), where k is
the total number of coupons and t is the number of trials.

17:6 F. Chierichetti et al.
Lemma 3. Consider the standard Coupon Collector’s process, where we are given an urn of k different coupons, and we draw coupons from the urn, equally likely with replacement. Let C(k,t) denote
the number of distinct coupons drawn in t trials. Then for any t ≥ 0,
Pr(C(k,t) < k) ≤ ke−t /k , (1)
and for any λ < k,
Pr (C(k,t) ≤ λ) ≤ Pr (B(t, 1 − λ/k) ≤ λ). (2)
Proof. The probability that a given coupon is not selected in t trials is
(1 − 1/k)
t ≤ e−t /k ,
and by a union bound, the probability at least one coupon is not selected, i.e., C(k,t) < k, is at
most ke−t /k . This proves (1).
Let Xi , 1 ≤ i ≤ t, be a binary random variable which is 1 if a new coupon is selected in the ith
trial or if the total number of distinct coupons selected in the previous i − 1 trials is larger than λ;
otherwise, Xi = 0. Then
Pr (C(k,t) ≤ λ) = Pr

Xi ≤ λ

.
The probability that Xi = 1 is at least 1 − λ
k , independently of the outcome of the previous trials,
because either more than λ distinct coupons have been selected in the first i − 1 trials and then
Xi = 1, or at most λ coupons have been selected, and thus the probability a new coupon is selected
in the ith trial is at least k−λ
k . Therefore, we can apply Lemma 2 to obtain

Combining the last two equations above gives Equation (2).
Finally, we will use the following Chernoff bounds for binomial random variables, which can be
found, e.g., in References [16, 31].

4 OPTIMAL BOUND FOR PUSH-PULL
In this section, we prove a general upper bound of O(logn/ϕ) rounds for PUSH-PULL on any nnode graph with conductance ϕ. Further, we argue that this bound is best possible if we have no
additional information for the graph other than ϕ and n.
The formal statement of the upper bound is as follows.
Theorem 5. Let G = (V, E) be a connected n-node graph with conductance ϕ. Then O(logn/ϕ)
rounds of PUSH-PULL suffice w.h.p. to spread to all nodes of G a message originated at an arbitrary
source node.
The proof of Theorem 5 relies on the next key lemma, which states that a message spreads from
a node of maximum degree to all other nodes in O(logn/ϕ) rounds w.h.p. This statement is true
even if only PULL is used. Recall that Δ denotes the maximum degree of G.

Rumor Spreading and Conductance 17:7
Lemma 6. Using PULL, a message originated at a node of degree Δ spreads to all other nodes in
O(logn/ϕ) rounds with probability at least 1 − n−c , for any constant c > 0.
The proof of Lemma 6 is based on an analysis of the growth of the volume of the set of informed
nodes and is given in Section 4.1.
We will also use the following basic lemma, which underlines the symmetries in the PUSH and
PULL strategies.
Lemma 7. Let u t
→− push v denote the event that a message originated at vertex u reaches vertex v in
at most t rounds when PUSH is used, and define u t
→− pull v similarly. For any u,v ∈ V , and t ≥ 0, we
have Pr(u t
→− push v) = Pr(v t
→− pull u).
Proof. W.l.o.g. we can assume that in each round, every node (informed or not) chooses a random neighbor. Of course only informed nodes actually establish a connection to the neighbor
they choose in the PUSH strategy, and only uninformed nodes establish a connection in the PULL
strategy. Let Ωt be the space of possible choices for all nodes over t rounds, i.e., each ω ∈ Ωt
specifies for every node u ∈ V and round i ∈ {1 ...t}, the neighbor that u chooses in round i. Observe that all ω ∈ Ωt have the same probability: Pr(ω) = u ∈V (deg(u))−t . Further, each ω ∈ Ωt
completely determines the spread of a message in t rounds, given the source node and the rumor spreading strategy. Let Ωt (u,v, push) be the set of all ω ∈ Ωt for which a message originated at u reaches v within t rounds when PUSH is used, and define Ωt (u,v, pull) similarly. Since
all ω ∈ Ωt have the same probability, it suffices to show that |Ωt (u,v, push)| = |Ωt (v,u, pull)| to
prove Pr(u t
→− push v) = Pr(v t
→− pull u).
For ω ∈ Ωt , let rev(ω) ∈ Ωt contain the same collection of choices as ω but in reverse round
order, i.e., if node u chooses node v in round i in ω, then u chooses v in round t − i in rev(ω). We
now argue that ω ∈ Ωt (u,v, push) iff rev(ω) ∈ Ωt (v,u, pull). A push path for ω ∈ Ωt is a list of
nodes u0,...,ut such that for any two consecutive nodes ui−1 and ui , either (i) ui−1 = ui , or (ii) ui−1
chooses ui in round i. A pull path is defined similarly except that (ii) is replaced by (ii
) ui chooses
ui−1 in round i. For a given ω ∈ Ωt , PUSH (or PULL) informs node v within t rounds of a message
originated at u iff there is a push path (respectively, pull path) from u to v. Further, u0,u1,...,ut ,
with u0 = u and ut = v, is a push path for ω iff ut,ut−1,...,u0 is a pull path for rev(ω). From
the last two observations, it follows that ω ∈ Ωt (u,v, push) iff rev(ω) ∈ Ωt (v,u, pull). From this
and the fact that for distinct ω,ω ∈ Ωt we have rev(ω)  rev(ω
), we obtain |Ωt (u,v, push)| =
|Ωt (v,u, pull)|.
Theorem 5 follows easily from the two lemmas above: From Lemma 6 we have that a message
originating from an arbitrary source node u needs O(logn/ϕ) rounds of PULL to spread to all nodes
w.h.p., after it has reached a node v of degree Δ. Further, by combining Lemma 6 with Lemma 7, we
obtain that O(logn/ϕ) rounds suffice w.h.p. for u’s message to reach the max-degree node v using
PUSH.
Proof of Theorem 5 (Assuming Lemma 6 Holds). Let u be an arbitrary node, and v be a node
with deg(v) = Δ. By Lemma 6, there is some t = O(logn/ϕ) such that t rounds of PULL suffice with
probability at least 1 − n−c to spread a message from v to all other nodes and thus to node u. From
this and Lemma 7, it follows that t rounds of PUSH suffice to spread a message from u to v with
probability at least 1 − n−c ; thus the same is true when PUSH-PULL is used instead of just PUSH.
Once v has learned u’s message, Lemma 6 implies, as mentioned above, that all nodes will learn
the message with probability at least 1 − n−c after at most t additional rounds of PULL (and thus of
PUSH-PULL). A union bound then gives that with probability at least 1 − 2n−c , v learns u’s message

within t rounds and then all remaining nodes learn the message within t additional rounds. Thus
all nodes get informed after a total number of at most 2t = O(logn/ϕ) rounds w.h.p.
Below, we give the proof of Lemma 6, in Section 4.1, and we argue about the optimality of
Theorem 5, in Section 4.2.
4.1 Analysis of Pull (Proof of Lemma 6)
In this section, we show that O(logn/ϕ) rounds of PULL suffice w.h.p. to spread a message to all
nodes if the source node has degree Δ.
The proof analyses the growth rate of the volume of informed vertices. Let It be the set of
informed nodes after the first t rounds, and let Ut = V − It be the set of uninformed nodes at that
time. Roughly speaking, we argue that while vol(It ) is at most some constant fraction of the total
volume vol(V ), vol(It ) increases by a factor of at least 1 + Ω(ϕ) per round on average; and after that,
vol(Ut ) decreases by a factor of at most 1 − Ω(ϕ). It follows that O(log(vol(V ))/ϕ) = O(logn/ϕ)
rounds suffice for vol(It ) to increase to a constant fraction of vol(V ) and then O(logn/ϕ) additional
rounds suffice for vol(Ut ) to drop to zero.
To convey the main intuition let us compute the expected increase of vol(It ) in round t + 1 (see
Lemma 8(a) for the formal argument): Suppose that vol(It ) ≤ vol(V )/2, and for each uninformed
node v ∈ Ut let deg
(v) be the number of its informed neighbors. The contribution of v to the
expected increase of vol(It ) is then (deg
(v)/ deg(v)) · deg(v) = deg
(v), as v chooses some of its
informed neighbors in round t + 1 (and pulls the message from it) with probability deg
(v)/ deg(v).
It follows
E[vol(It+1) | It] − vol(It ) =

v ∈Ut
deg
(v) = | cut(It,Ut )| ≥ ϕ · vol(It ),
by the definition of conductance. Thus, E[vol(It+1) | It] ≥ (1 + ϕ) vol(It ). Similarly, we obtain
E[vol(Ut+1) | Ut] ≤ (1 − ϕ) vol(Ut ), when vol(It ) ≥ vol(V )/2. These simple expectation bounds,
together with Markov’s Inequality, suffice to obtain an O(logn/ϕ) bound w.h.p. on the number of
rounds until all nodes get informed, from the time when a constant fraction of the total volume
has been informed (Lemma 11). To bound the time to inform that constant fraction, however, more
work is required. For that we bound also the variance of the increase of vol(It ) (Lemma 8(b)) and
use the second moment method to show that the volume doubles in O(1/ϕ) rounds with constant
probability (Lemma 9). From this last result and Chernoff Bounds, we obtain the desired highprobability bound on the time to inform a constant fraction of the total volume (Lemma 10).
Next we give the detailed analysis.
Consider the volume L of nodes that get informed in a round by pulling the message through
a given set D of edges between informed and uninformed nodes (D does not necessarily contain
all edges between informed and uninformed nodes and is fixed before the round starts). The next
lemma states that the expectation of L is equal to the number of edges contained in D, and L’s
variance is bounded by the number of edges times the maximum degree of their endpoints in Ut .
Lemma 8. Fix an arbitrary subset D of cut(It,Ut ) before round t + 1, and let L be the volume of the
set of nodes that get informed in round t + 1 by pulling the message through edges from D. Then
(a) E[L] = |D|.
(b) Var[L] ≤ |D| · maxv ∈N deg(v), where N is the set of nodesv ∈ Ut incident to some edge in D.
Proof. For each node v ∈ N, let degD (v) be the number of edges from set D that are incident
to v. Clearly, 
v ∈N degD (v) = |D|. For each v ∈ N, let Xv be a binary random variable that is 1 if v
gets informed in round t + 1 by pulling the message through some edge from D and is 0 otherwise.

Then, Pr(Xv = 1) = degD (v)/ deg(v). We have L = 

In the following, we first bound the number of rounds to inform a constant fraction of the total
volume, namely a 1/3 fraction, and then bound the number of rounds to inform the remaining
nodes.
Informing a Constant Fraction of the Volume. We prove that O(lnn/ϕ) rounds of PULL suffice
w.h.p. to inform a subset of nodes with volume at least vol(V )/3, when the message starts from a
node of degree Δ.
Our key claim is that if Δ ≤ vol(It ) ≤ vol(V )/3, then O(1/ϕ) rounds suffice with constant probability to double the volume of informed nodes. The proof proceeds as follows. Before each round
t + k > t, we fix an edge set Dk ⊆ cut(It+k−1,Ut+k−1) of size |Dk | = ϕ · vol(It ); this set can be arbitrary but must be fixed before round t + k starts. Then we compute the volume Lk of the set of
nodes that get informed in round t + k by pulling the message through edges from Dk . Clearly,

1≤i ≤k Li is a lower bound on vol(It+k ) − vol(It ) and thus to prove the claim it suffices to show that

1≤i ≤k Li ≥ vol(It ) holds with constant probability. To show that, we use Lemma 8 to compute
the expectation of 
1≤i ≤k Li and to bound its variance and then apply Chebyshev’s Inequality.
Lemma 9 below proves a slightly more general statement, which does not assume that volume
vol(It ) is at least Δ, and gives a lower bound on the probability that the volume doubles within a
given number k of steps, as a function of k and the ratio Δ/ vol(It ).
Lemma 9. If vol(It ) ≤ vol(V )/3, then for any k > 1/ϕ,

Proof. Throughout the proof, we assume that It is fixed and vol(It ) ≤ vol(V )/3. Let

.
For each 1 ≤ k ≤ τ , we define random variable Lk as follows. Let Dk denote the set of the first

will see in Equation (3) that | cut(It+k−1,Ut+k−1)| ≥ M.) Then Lk is the volume of the set of nodes
that get informed in round t + k by pulling the message through edges from Dk . Further, for each
k > τ , we let Lk = M.
We argue now that for any t with t ≤ t < t + τ ,
| cut(It,Ut )| ≥ M. (3)
If vol(It ) ≤ vol(V )/2, then ϕ(It ) ≥ ϕ. Also vol(It ) ≥ vol(It ). Then
| cut(It,Ut )| = ϕ(It ) · vol(It ) ≥ ϕ · vol(It ).
If vol(It ) > vol(V )/2, then vol(Ut ) < vol(V )/2, and thus ϕ(Ut ) ≥ ϕ. Also vol(It ) < 2 vol(It ) and
thus vol(Ut ) > vol(V ) − 2 vol(It ) ≥ vol(It ), as vol(It ) ≤ vol(V )/3. Then
| cut(It,Ut )| = ϕ(Ut ) · vol(Ut ) ≥ ϕ · vol(It ).
For each k ≥ 0, let Yk = 
1≤i ≤k Li . Then for k ≤ τ , Yk is a lower bound on the volume of nodes
informed in rounds t + 1 up to t + k, i.e., Yk ≤ vol(It+k ) − vol(It ). It follows that if vol(It+k ) <
2 vol(It ), then k < τ and Yk ≤ vol(It+k ) − vol(It ) < vol(It ). Therefore,
Pr(vol(It+k ) < 2 vol(It )) ≤ Pr(Yk < vol(It )). (4)
Next we bound the probability on the right side that Yk < vol(It ). For that, we compute the expectation and variance of Yk and then apply Chebyshev’s Inequality.
If 1 ≤ k ≤ τ , then from Lemma 8(a) it follows that
E[Lk | It+k−1] = |Dk | = M.
This equation is also trivially true if k > τ , as Lk = M in this case. It follows that for all k ≥ 1,
E[Lk ] = E[E[Lk | It+k−1]] = M,
and by linearity of expectation,
E[Yk ] = kM. (5)
For the variance of Yk we have
Var[Yk ] = Var[Yk−1 + Lk ] = Var[Yk−1] + Var[Lk ] + 2Cov[Yk−1, Lk ].
The covariance term is zero, as
E

(Yk−1 − E[Yk−1]) · (Lk − E[Lk ]) 	
	
	
It ... It+k−1


= (Yk−1 − E[Yk−1]) · (E[Lk | It+k−1] − E[Lk ])
= (Yk−1 − E[Yk−1]) · (M − M) = 0,
and thus Cov[Yk−1, Lk ] = E[E[(Yk−1 − E[Yk−1]) · (Lk − E[Lk ])| It ... It+k−1]] = 0. Substituting this
to the formula for Var[Yk ] above yields
Var[Yk ] = Var[Yk−1] + Var[Lk ].
We now bound Var[Lk ]. If 1 ≤ k ≤ τ , then from Lemma 8(b) it follows
Var[Lk | It+k−1] ≤ |Dk | · max
v ∈Nk
deg(v) ≤ MΔ, (6)
where Nk is the set of nodes v ∈ Ut+k−1 incident to some edge in Dk . The above inequality is also
trivially true if k > τ , as Var[Lk | It+k−1] = 0 in this case. It follows that Var[Lk ] ≤ MΔ, for all
k ≥ 1. Substituting this to the equation for Var[Yk ] above gives Var[Yk ] ≤ Var[Yk−1] + MΔ, and
applying this inequality repeatedly yields
Var[Yk ] ≤ kMΔ. (7)

Rumor Spreading and Conductance 17:11
We use now Chebyshev’s Inequality to bound the probability that Yk < vol(It ). We assume that
k > 1/ϕ. Then from Equation (5), E[Yk ] = kM > M/ϕ ≥ vol(It ). We have
Pr (Yk < vol(It )) = Pr (E[Yk ] − Yk > E[Yk ] − vol(It )) <

where the last inequality holds because kM/ vol(It ) ≥ kϕ, and the function f (x) = x/(x − 1)
2 is
decreasing for x > 1. Combining the above bound on Pr (Yk < vol(It )) with Equation (4) completes
the proof of Lemma 9.
Using Lemma 9 and Chernoff Bounds, we show next our main claim, that O(lnn/ϕ) rounds
suffice w.h.p. to inform a subset of nodes with volume at least vol(V )/3.
Lemma 10. If the source of the message has degree Δ, then Pr(vol(It ) ≥ vol(V )/3) ≥ 1 − n−c , for
t = 2c lnn + 4 logn	·4/ϕ	.
Proof. We divide rumor spreading into phases of k := 4/ϕ	 rounds each and consider whether
the volume of informed vertices doubles in these phases. For each i ≥ 1, let Xi be a binary random
variable that is 1 if vol(Iik ) ≥ 2 vol(I(i−1)k ) or vol(I(i−1)k ) ≥ vol(V )/3 and is 0 otherwise. From
Lemma 9 it follows

vol(I(i−1)k ) ≥ 1 − 4

Δ = 5/9 > 1/2. (8)
We bound the probability that vol(It ) < vol(V )/3 in terms of the sum of Xi : If vol(Iik ) < vol(V )/3,
then fewer than log(vol(V )/(3Δ)) among the random variables X1 ...Xi are 1, because, otherwise,
the volume of informed nodes would double at least log(vol(V )/(3Δ)) times in the first ik rounds
and thus increase from Δ to at least 2log(vol(V )/(3Δ))Δ = vol(V )/3. Therefore,

as vol(V ) ≤ nΔ. To bound the sum of the (non-independent) random variables Xi , we use the fact
we showed in Equation (8) that for alli ≥ 1, Pr(Xi = 1 | I(i−1)k ) ≥ 1/2, and apply Lemma 2 to obtain
Pr(

j ≤i Xj < logn) ≤ Pr(B(i, 1/2) < logn). Then Lemma 4(a) gives for i ≥ 2 logn,

Letting i ≥ 2c lnn + 4 logn, the above bound becomes at most e−c ln n = n−c . Therefore, we have
that Pr (vol (Iik ) < vol(V )/3) ≤ n−c for i = 2c lnn + 4 logn	.

Informing the Remaining Nodes. We show that O(lnn/ϕ) rounds of PULL suffice w.h.p. to inform
all the remaining nodes, after a set of nodes with volume at least vol(V )/3 has been informed.
Lemma 11. If vol(It ) ≥ vol(V )/3, then Pr(Ut+k = ∅ | It ) ≥ 1 − n−c , for k = 2(c + 2) lnn/ϕ	.
Proof. In the following, we assume It is fixed and vol(It ) ≥ vol(V )/3. We first argue that for
t ≥ t,
| cut(It,Ut )| ≥ ϕ · vol(Ut )/2.
If vol(Ut ) ≤ vol(V )/2, then ϕ(Ut ) ≥ ϕ and | cut(It,Ut )| = ϕ(Ut ) · vol(Ut ) ≥ ϕ · vol(Ut ).
If vol(Ut ) > vol(V )/2, then ϕ(It ) ≥ ϕ and | cut(It,Ut )| = ϕ(It ) · vol(It ) ≥ ϕ · vol(It ) ≥
ϕ · vol(Ut )/2, as vol(It ) ≥ vol(V )/3.
Lemma 8(a), for D = cut(It,Ut ), gives E[vol(Ut − Ut+1) | It] = | cut(It,Ut )|. Substituting the
bound for | cut(It,Ut )| from above and rearranging yields
E[vol(Ut+1) | It] ≤ (1 − ϕ/2) · vol(Ut ).
Taking the expectation on both sides gives E[vol(Ut+1)] ≤ (1 − ϕ/2) · E[vol(Ut )], and applying
this inequality repeatedly yields, for t = t + k,
E[vol(Ut )] ≤ (1 − ϕ/2)
k · vol(Ut ) ≤ e−kϕ/2 · n2
.
For k ≥ 2(c + 2) lnn/ϕ, we get E[vol(Ut )] ≤ n−c , and then Markov’s Inequality gives
Pr(Ut  ∅) = Pr(vol(Ut ) ≥ 1) ≤ E[vol(Ut )]/1 ≤ n−c
.
Lemma 6 follows now immediately from Lemmas 10 and 11 and a union bound.
4.2 Tightness of the Upper Bound
We observe that the upper bound of Theorem 5 is tight. Indeed, there exist graphs on n nodes, with
conductance ϕ, that have diameter Ω(logn/ϕ). We now present one example of such a graph. Let
ϕ > 1/n1−ϵ , and take any graph on Θ(ϕn) nodes with constant degree and constant conductance
(e.g., a random cubic graph on Θ(ϕn) nodes.) Then, replace each edge of the graph with a path
of length Θ(ϕ−1). The resulting graph will have conductance Θ(ϕ) and will contain Θ(n) nodes.
Moreover, the diameter of the new graph will be equal to the diameter of the original graph times
Θ(ϕ−1)—since the original graph had constant degree, its diameter is at least logarithmic in its order, that is, at least Ω (log(ϕn)). Therefore, the new graph will have diameter at least Ω (log(ϕn)/ϕ).
Since ϕ > 1/n1−ϵ , the lower bound reduces to Ω (logn/ϕ).
5 A SUFFICIENT CONDITION FOR PUSH AND PULL
The O(logn/ϕ) bound we have shown for PUSH-PULL in Theorem 5 does not hold if only one
of the PUSH or PULL strategies is used. As already mentioned, for the n-vertex star, which has
conductance ϕ = 1, at least n − 1 rounds of PUSH are needed to inform all nodes, regardless of the
source. If PULL is used instead, and the message originates at a leaf of the star, then n rounds are
needed in expectation (n − 1 expected rounds until the center of the star pulls the message from
the source, and 1 additional round for all leaves to pull the message from the center). Observe,
however, that if the message originates at the center, then all nodes get informed in just a single
round of PULL. As shown in Lemma 6, for any graph G = (V, E) there is some node u ∈ V (namely,
any max-degree node u) such that a message originated at u spreads to all nodes within O(logn/ϕ)
rounds of PULL w.h.p. The same is not true for PUSH, as the example of the star shows.
The next theorem identifies a simple graph property which guarantees that the O(logn/ϕ)
bound holds for PUSH and PULL, regardless of the source of the message. The property states that
for any edge of the graph, the ratio of the degrees of its two endpoints is bounded by some constant.

Rumor Spreading and Conductance 17:13
Theorem 12. Let G = (V, E) be a connected n-node graph with conductance ϕ and the property
that for any edge uv ∈ E, deg(u)/ deg(v) = Θ(1). Then O(logn/ϕ) rounds of PUSH or PULL suffice
w.h.p. to spread to all nodes of G a message originated at an arbitrary source node.
Proof. The analysis for PULL is the same as that for Lemma 6, except for a few small modifications we point out now. In place of Lemma 9, we use the following statement.
Lemma 13. Suppose that for every edgeuv ∈ E, we have deg(u)/ deg(v) ∈ [1/α, α]for some α ≥ 1.
If vol(It ) ≤ vol(V )/3, then for any k > 1/ϕ,
Pr 
vol(It+k ) ≥ 2 vol(It ) | It
	
> 1 − kϕ
(kϕ − 1)2 · α.
The proof of Lemma 13 is identical to that of Lemma 9, except that, in Equation (6), we do not
bound maxv ∈Nk deg(v) by Δ but use instead that
max
v ∈Nk
deg(v) ≤ α · vol(It ).
This inequality holds because each node v ∈ Nk has degree bounded by α · maxu ∈It+k−1 deg(u),
and each node u ∈ It+k−1 has degree at most vol(It ): If u ∈ It , then deg(u) ≤ vol(It ), and if u ∈
It+k−1 − It then deg(u) ≤ vol(It+k−1) − vol(It ) < vol(It ), since vol(It+k−1) < 2 vol(It ).
Using Lemma 13, we show, as in Lemma 10, that O(logn/ϕ) rounds suffice w.h.p. to inform a
1/3 fraction of the total volume, but now we do not need the assumption that the source node
has degree Δ. Precisely, we show that Pr(vol(It ) ≥ vol(V )/3) ≥ 1 − n−c for t = 2c lnn + 4 logn	 ·
4α/ϕ	. From this and Lemma 11, the bound of Theorem 12 follows for PULL.
For PUSH, the O(logn/ϕ) bound is obtained by combining the above O(logn/ϕ) bound for PULL,
with Lemma 7 on the symmetry between the two strategies.
6 RUMOR SPREADING AND GRAPH SPARSIFICATION
In this section, we give an alternative proof that PUSH-PULL finishes in a number of rounds that
is at most polynomial in logn/ϕ. The proof relies on an interesting connection between rumor
spreading and the Spielman-Teng sparsification process [36, 37].
Theorem 14. Let G = (V, E) be a connected n-node graph with conductance ϕ. Then O(log4 n/ϕ6)
rounds of PUSH-PULL suffice w.h.p. to spread to all nodes in G a message originated at an arbitrary
source node.
The proof of Theorem 14 relates the volume expansion of the Spielman-Teng sparsification
process, denoted st, to that of an edge sampling process, pp, which selects edges similarly to
PUSH-PULL. Roughly, the volume expansion of an edge sampling process on G is the minimum,
over all S ⊆ V , of the ratio volG (S
)/ volG (S), where S is the set of vertices inV − S that are reachable from S via a sampled edge (Definition 15). Process st selects each edge uv independently
with probability ϒ/ min{deg(u), deg(v)}, where ϒ = Θ(log2 n/ϕ4). Process pp on the other hand,
chooses for each node u a number of Ψ = Θ(ϒ · logn) edges incident to u at random with replacement, imitating the random choices of nodes in Ψ rounds of PUSH-PULL.
It has been shown that the subgraph sampled by st almost preserves certain spectral parameters
of the original graph G. We use this result to show that the volume expansion of st is Ω(ϕ2)
(Lemma 21). We relate st and pp by showing that process pp stochastically dominates st, in the
sense that there is a coupling of the two processes for which the edges selected by st are w.h.p. a
subset of those selected by pp (Lemma 23); this is our key technical claim. Once we have established
this dominance, we infer that the volume expansion of pp is at least that of st, i.e., Ω(ϕ2). It follows
that Ψ rounds of PUSH-PULL increase the volume of informed nodes by a factor of 1 + Ω(ϕ2), and
Journal of the ACM, Vol. 65, No. 4, Article 17. Publication date: April 2018. 
17:14 F. Chierichetti et al.
thus O(Ψ · logn/ϕ2) = O(log4 n/ϕ6) rounds suffice to inform half of the total volume. A symmetric
argument gives that O(log4 n/ϕ6) additional rounds suffice to inform the remaining graph.
Below, we first set some definitions and notation, in Section 6.1. Then we review Spielman-Teng
sparsification and analyze its volume expansion in Section 6.2. Last, we relate that process to rumor
spreading and prove Theorem 14 in Section 6.3.
6.1 Definitions
We start with some terminology on edge sampling processes.
Definition 15 (Edge Sampling and Volume Expansion). Let f be a (randomized) process selecting
edges in graphG = (V, E). We denote by f (G) the spanning subgraph ofG whose edge set consists
of the edges selected by f . Process f may also associate a weight with each edge it selects, in which
case f (G) is a weighted graph. The volume expansion of f on G, denoted βf ,G , is the minimum
over all non-empty sets S ⊂ V , of the ratio3
volG (Γf (G) (S))
min{volG (S), volG (V − S)}
.
Definition 15 above states that graph f (G) obtained by process f may have weights associated
to its edges. Next, we formalize various notions of weight we will use and also extend the standard
definition of conductance to take weights into account.
Definition 16 (Weights). LetG = (V, E,w) be a weighted graph where each edge e ∈ E has weight
we . The weight of a set of edges E ⊆ E is wG (E
) := 
e ∈E we ; the weight of a vertex u ∈ V is
wG (v) := 
v ∈Γ(u) wuv ; and the weight of a set of vertices S ⊆ V is wG (S) := 
u ∈S wG (u).
Definition 17 (Weighted Conductance). Consider a weighted graph G = (V, E,w). The weighted
conductance of a non-empty vertex set S in graph G is
φG (S) := wG (cutG (S,V − S))
wG (S) .
The weighted conductance φG of G is the minimum φG (S) over all S for which wG (S) ≤ wG (V )/2.
In the notations above, we will omit subscript G whenever the graph is clear from the context.
6.2 Spectral Sparsification
Next we recall the Spielman-Teng spectral sparsification procedure.
Definition 18 (Spielman-Teng Sparsification). Given a graphG = (V, E), the Spielman-Teng sparsification process [36, 37], denoted st, is an edge sampling process that selects each edge uv ∈ E
independently with probability
puv := min 

1, ϒ
min{deg(u), deg(v)}

,
where ϒ > 0 is a parameter of the process. The process also assigns to each selected edge e a weight
we := p−1
e .
Note that since the weight of each edge in st(G) is inversely proportional to the edge selection
probability, the expected weight of each vertex in st(G) is the same as the degree of that vertex
in G.
It was shown in Reference [37, Theorem 6.1] that if ϒ = Ω(log2 n/ϕ4
G ), then with high probability,
st(G) is an (1 + ϵ )-spectral approximation of graphG, i.e., it has the same Laplacian quadratic form
3Recall that ΓG (S ) = 
u∈S ΓG (u) − S.

Rumor Spreading and Conductance 17:15
as G within a factor of 1 + ϵ. This implies the following result, stating that st(G) approximately
preserves cut weights, as well as the conductance of G—the latter within a quadratic exponent.
Lemma 19 (Properties of st). Let 0 < ϵ < 1/2 and c ≥ 1, and let G = (V, E) be an n-node graph
with conductance ϕ. Suppose that we apply the st process on G with parameter
ϒ ≥

24c log(3n)
ϵϕ2
2
,
and let G˜ := st(G). Then with probability at least 1 − n−c , the following hold:
(a) For any S ⊆ V ,
1
1 + ϵ · | cutG (S,V − S)| ≤ wG˜ (cutG˜ (S,V − S)) ≤ (1 + ϵ ) · | cutG (S,V − S)|. (9)
(b) The weighted conductance φG˜ of G˜ satisfies
φG˜ ≥ ϕ2
G
4 (1 + ϵ )
. (10)
Remark 20. As already mentioned, Reference [37, Theorem 6.1] is more general than our
Lemma 19, proving that G˜ is an (1 + ϵ )-spectral approximation of G. This immediately implies
the weaker notion of (1 + ϵ )-cut approximation stated in Equation (9) [2]. To obtain Equation (10),
we use the fact that the (1 + ϵ )-spectral approximation implies that the eigenvalues of the Laplacians of G and G˜ differ by at most a factor of (1 + ϵ ). Then we apply Cheeger’s Inequality [7, 11],
stating that for any unweighted or weighted graph with (weighted) conductance ϕ the smallest
non-zero eigenvalue λ of its normalized Laplacian satisfies ϕ2/2 ≤ λ ≤ 2ϕ.
Using Lemma 19, we show now that the volume expansion of st is Ω(ϕ2
G ) w.h.p.
Lemma 21 (Volume Expansion of st). Under the same assumptions as in Lemma 19, with probability at least 1 − n−c , the volume expansion of st on G is
βst,G ≥ ϕ2
G
4 (1 + ϵ )3 . (11)
Proof. Lemma 19(a), applied for a singleton set S = {u}, implies that for any u ∈ V ,
1
1 + ϵ · wG˜ (u) ≤ degG (u) ≤ (1 + ϵ ) · wG˜ (u).
From this, it follows that for any T ⊆ V , the volume of T in G: volG (T ) = 
u ∈T degG (u), satisfies
1
1 + ϵ · wG˜ (T ) ≤ volG (T ) ≤ (1 + ϵ ) · wG˜ (T ). (12)
We now proceed to derive Equation (11). Applying Equation (12) for T = ΓG˜ (S), we obtain
volG (ΓG˜ (S)) ≥
1
1 + ϵ · wG˜ (ΓG˜ (S))
≥
1
1 + ϵ · wG˜ (cutG˜ (S,V − S)), (13)

where the last inequality holds because cutG˜ (S,V − S) is just a subset of the edges incident to
vertices in ΓG˜ (S). From the definition of weighted conductance,
wG˜ (cutG˜ (S,V − S)) ≥ φG˜ · min{wG˜ (S), wG˜ (V − S)}

G
4 (1 + ϵ )2 · min {volG (S), volG (V − S)}, by Equation (10).
Substituting that to Equation (13) and using the definition of βst,G , we obtain Equation (11).
6.3 Relating Sparsification to Rumor Spreading (Proof of Theorem 14)
We consider now the following edge sampling process, pp, which imitates the random choices of
nodes in PUSH-PULL.
Definition 22 (Process pp). Let pp be an edge sampling processes which selects edges from a given
graph G = (V, E) as follows. Let Eu be the set of all edges e ∈ E incident to vertex u, and let Ψ > 0
be an integer parameter of the process. For each vertex u ∈ V , process pp draws Ψ edges from Eu
independently at random with replacement; let Fu be the set of edges drawn for u. The total set of
edges selected by pp is the union of all sets Fu , u ∈ V .
Note that graph pp(G) is unweighted, unlike graph st(G).
The next lemma is our main technical claim, showing that w.h.p. the volume expansion of pp
is at least equal to that of st, if Ψ = Ω(ϒ · logn). The proof shows a coupling of pp and st under
which st(G) is a subgraph of pp(G) w.h.p. For this coupling, we consider a variant of st, denoted
st2, which makes two (independent) attempts to select each edge uv: One attempt succeeds with
probability ϒ/ deg(u), and the other with probability ϒ/ deg(v)
4 (thus, the total success probability
is at least as high as for a single attempt with the probability puv from Definition 18). We associate
the first attempt with vertex u and the second with v. This allows us to couple st2 and pp by considering independently for each vertex u, the selections of the two processes: In st2, we select each
edge incident to u with probability ϒ/ deg(u), while in pp we make Ψ = Ω(ϒ · logn) independent
choices selecting random edges incident to u with replacement; let Lu and Fu be the respective
sets of selected edges. We are looking for a coupling that ensures Lu ⊆ Fu w.h.p. We observe that
given |Lu | = k, the set Lu is just a random k-subset of the edges incident to u, and the same is true
for Fu , given |Fu | = k. It follows that the desired coupling exists, if |Lu | is stochastically dominated
by |Fu |. We have that |Lu | is distributed like binomial random variable B(deg(u), ϒ/ deg(u)), while
|Fu | is distributed like Coupon Collector’s random variable C(deg(u), Ψ) (see Lemma 3). We then
use Lemma 3 to show the desired stochastic dominance of B(deg(u), ϒ/ deg(u)) by C(deg(u), Ψ).
Lemma 23 (Volume Expansion of pp). Let 0 < ϵ < 1/2 and c ≥ 1, and letG = (V, E) be an n-node
graph with conductance ϕ. Suppose that we apply the pp process on G with parameter
Ψ ≥

Then with probability at least 1 − 2n−c , the volume expansion of pp on G is

4Formally, the probabilities are min{1, ϒ/ deg(u)} and min{1, ϒ/ deg(v)}, respectively, but for simplicity we omit the “min”
in this informal overview.

Proof. We show that there exists a coupling of processes pp and st, where pp has parameter Ψ
satisfying Equation (14) and st has parameter
ϒ =

24c log(3n)
ϵϕ2
2
,
such that with probability at least 1 − n−c , graph G˜ := st(G) is a subgraph of Gˆ := pp(G). This
implies that with probability at least 1 − n−c , for any set S ⊆ V ,
volG (ΓGˆ (S)) ≥ volG (ΓG˜ (S)).
Combining that with Lemma 21, and using a union bound, proves Lemma 23. The rest of the proof
demonstrates the coupling we promised above.
Coupling of pp and st: Let st be a process identical to st except that the probability of selecting
edge uv is
p
uv := min 

1, ϒ
max{deg(u), deg(v)}

.
(Notice that we use max{deg(u), deg(v)} instead of min.) Consider now a process st2 that executes
independently st and st on G and selects all edges picked by at least one of st and st
. We will
show a coupling of pp and st2 for which st2 (G) is a subgraph of pp(G) with probability 1 − n−c .
This immediately implies a coupling of pp and st with the same property, since there is a trivial
coupling of st2 and st for which st(G) is a subgraph of st2 (G) (with probability 1).
There is a convenient equivalent way to describe st2, along the lines of Definition 22 of pp: For
each vertex u ∈ V , process st2 chooses each edge e ∈ Eu independently with probability
min 

1, ϒ
deg(u)

;
let Lu denote the set of edges chosen for u. Then the total set of edges selected by st2 is the union
of all Lu , u ∈ V . This description is equivalent to the original definition of st2, because each edge
uv ∈ E, where deg(u) ≤ deg(v), is added to Lu with probability puv and is independently added to
Lv with probability p
uv .
Observe that the random sets Lu , u ∈ V , are mutually independent, similar to the sets Fu in
the definition of pp. For each u ∈ V , the cardinality of set Lu follows the binomial distribution
B(deg(u), min{1, ϒ
deg(u) }). Moreover, for any 0 ≤ k ≤ deg(u), conditionally on |Lu | = k, we have
that Lu is a uniformly random k-subset of Eu . For pp on the other hand, we have that |Fu | has
the same distribution as C(deg(u), Ψ), in the statement of Lemma 3, i.e., the number of coupons
collected in Ψ trials in the Coupon Collector’s process with deg(u) coupons in total. Similarly to
Lu , we have that Fu is a uniformly random k-subset of Eu , given |Fu | = k.
We use the following coupling of the sets Lu and Fu . For each u ∈ V , we draw a sample u from
distribution B(deg(u), min{1, ϒ
deg(u) }) and a sample fu from the distribution of C(deg(u), Ψ), and,
independently, we choose a random permutation πu over the edges in Eu .
5 Then we let Lu be the
set of the first u edges in permutation πu , and let Fu be the set of the first fu edges in πu . From
the discussion above, it follows that the marginal distributions of Lu and Fu are the correct ones.
To show that st2 (G) is a subgraph of pp(G), i.e., 
u ∈V Lu ⊆ 
u ∈V Fu , it suffices to show that
Lu ⊆ Fu for all u ∈ V . And this is equivalent, under the coupling above, to showing that u ≤ fu
for all u ∈ V . We now show that u ≤ fu , for any u ∈ V , w.h.p.
For each vertex u ∈ V , we distinguish two cases depending on deg(u).
5Samples u and fu do not need to be independent.

• Case ϒ/ deg(u) ≥ 1/4: We apply Equation (1) of Lemma 3, for k = deg(u) and t = Ψ, to get
Pr 
C(deg(u), Ψ) < deg(u)
	
≤ deg(u) · e−Ψ/ deg(u)
≤ n · e−ϒ·(4c+8) ln n/ deg(u)
≤ n · e−(4c+8) ln n/4
, by the case hypothesis
= n−c−1
.
It follows that Pr(fu < deg(u)) ≤ n−c−1, and since u ≤ deg(u), we have
Pr(fu ≥ u ) ≥ 1 − n−c−1
.
• Case ϒ/ deg(u) < 1/4: Let
λ = min{deg(u)/2, Ψ/4}.
We apply Equation (2) of Lemma 3, for k = deg(u), t = Ψ and the above value of λ, to get
Pr (C(deg(u), Ψ) ≤ λ) ≤ Pr (B(Ψ, 1 − λ/ deg(u)) ≤ λ)
≤ Pr (B(Ψ, 1/2) ≤ λ)
≤ Pr (B(Ψ, 1/2) ≤ Ψ/4).
Using Lemma 4(a) to bound the probability in the last line above, gives
Pr (C(deg(u), Ψ) ≤ λ) ≤ e−2(Ψ/2−Ψ/4)
2/Ψ = e−Ψ/8
.
Therefore,
Pr(fu ≤ λ) ≤ e−Ψ/8
. (15)
Next we bound the probability that u ≥ λ. We have λ ≥ 2ϒ, because 2ϒ ≤ deg(u)/2 by the
case hypothesis, and 2ϒ ≤ Ψ/4 for the chosen values of ϒ and Ψ. Then,
Pr (B(deg(u), ϒ/ deg(u)) ≥ λ) ≤ Pr (B(deg(u), ϒ/ deg(u)) ≥ 2ϒ) ,
≤ e−ϒ/3
,
by Lemma 4(b). Therefore,
Pr(u ≥ λ) ≤ e−ϒ/3
.
Combining that with Equation (15), and applying a union bound, gives
Pr(fu > λ > u ) ≥ 1 − e−Ψ/8 − e−ϒ/3 > 1 − n−c−1
.
Therefore, in both cases above it holds
Pr(fu ≥ u ) ≥ 1 − n−c−1
.
Then, by a union bound, the probability that fu ≥ u for allu ∈ V is at least 1 − n−c . This completes
the proof of Lemma 23.
The next claim follows from Lemma 23, and the analogy between the random choices made by
pp and PUSH-PULL.
Lemma 24. Suppose that a set of nodes S ⊆ V in graphG = (V, E) know a message at a given time.
Then after applying r rounds of PUSH-PULL, where

0 < ϵ < 1/2, and c ≥ 1, the total volume of informed nodes has increased by at least
ϕ2
G
4 (1 + ϵ )3 · min{vol(S), vol(V − S)},
with probability at least 1 − 2n−c .
Proof. For each u ∈ V , let Vu denote the set of neighbors that u selects during the r rounds of
PUSH-PULL. The edge sets {uv : v ∈ Vu }, u ∈ V , are distributed identically to the sets Fu selected
by pp, when pp is applied to G with parameter Ψ = r. It follows that, if S is the set of vertices
u ∈ V − S that either select or are selected by at east one neighbor from S during PUSH-PULL, then
volG (S
) has the same distribution as volG (Γpp(G) (S)). By the definition of volume expansion,
volG (Γpp(G) (S)) ≥ βpp,G · min{volG (S), volG (V − S)},
and applying Lemma 23, gives that
volG (Γpp(G) (S)) ≥ ϕ2
G
4 (1 + ϵ )3 · min{volG (S), volG (V − S)},
with probability at least 1 − n−c . The claim now follows, because all vertices u ∈ S get informed
during PUSH-PULL, since they communicate with at least one informed neighbor from S.
We are now ready to prove our main result.
Proof of Theorem 14. In preparation to apply Lemma 24, we divide rumor spreading into
phases of r rounds each, where r is as in (16), i.e.,
r :=

24c log(3n)
ϵϕ2
2
· (4c + 8) lnn.
Recall that It denotes the set of informed nodes after the first t rounds and Ut = V − It . Let
ρ := ϕ2
4 (1 + ϵ )3 .
For each i ≥ 1, let Xi be a binary random variable that is 1 if
vol 
I(i−1)r − Iir 	
≥ ρ · min 
vol 
I(i−1)r
	
, vol 
U(i−1)r
	
;
otherwise, Xi = 0. Lemma 24 implies that for each i ≥ 1, Pr(Xi = 1) ≥ 1 − 2n−c . Moreover, it is
easy to see that Iir  V (i.e., not all nodes are informed after ir rounds) implies

1≤j ≤i
Xj < 2 ln1+ρ (vol(V )/2).
By a union bound, the probability that Xj = 1 for all j ≤ i is at least 1 − in−c . It follows that for
i = 2 ln1+ρ (vol(V )/2), we have Iir = V with probability at least
1 − ln1+ρ (vol(V )/2) · n−c = 1 − Ω(n−c logn/ρ) = 1 − Ω(n−c+4 logn),
where for the last equation we used that ϕ = Ω(1/n2) for any connected n-node graph. It follows
that, with the above probability, the number of rounds before all nodes get informed is at most
r · 2 ln1+ρ (vol(V )/2) = O(log4 n/ρϕ4) = O(log4 n/ϕ6).   
