In artificial intelligence, a key question concerns how an agent may rationally revise its beliefs in light of
new information. The standard (AGM) approach to belief revision assumes that the underlying logic contains
classical propositional logic. This is a significant limitation, since many representation schemes in AI don’t
subsume propositional logic. In this article, we consider the question of what the minimal requirements are
on a logic, such that the AGM approach to revision may be formulated. We show that AGM-style revision
can be obtained even when extremely little is assumed of the underlying language and its semantics; in fact,
one requires little more than a language with sentences that are satisfied at models, or possible worlds. The
classical AGM postulates are expressed in this framework and a representation result is established between
the postulate set and certain preorders on possible worlds. To obtain the representation result, we add a
new postulate to the AGM postulates, and we add a constraint to preorders on worlds. Crucially, both of
these additions are redundant in the original AGM framework, and so we extend, rather than modify, the
AGM approach. As well, iterated revision is addressed and the Darwiche/Pearl postulates are shown to be
compatible with our approach. Various examples are given to illustrate the approach, including Horn clause
revision, revision in extended logic programs, and belief revision in a very basic logic called literal revision.

1 INTRODUCTION
In all but the simplest of circumstances and environments, an agent will have to alter its beliefs to
take into account new information. Such new information may fill in gaps in the agent’s beliefs, or
it may correct an agent’s incorrectly held belief. So, very broadly, in this process of belief revision,
an agent will receive information about the domain; this information may or may not conflict
with the agent’s beliefs; but one way or another, this new information is to be incorporated into
the agent’s beliefs.
However, this process of incorporating new beliefs into an agent’s belief corpus is not arbitrary,
but rather is bound by various common-sense principles. For example, assume that the new information is given by a formula ϕ. Then, if the goal of revision is to incorporate this information,
following the process of revision, ϕ should appear among the agent’s beliefs. One possibility would
be to simply add ϕ to the agent’s beliefs; in such a case, ϕ would indeed be in the resulting belief
set. However, ϕ might conflict with the agent’s prior beliefs, and if this was the case, the agent
would fall into inconsistency. So another reasonable principle is that an agent’s beliefs should be
consistent after revision by a formula ϕ (unless ϕ itself is inconsistent). This in turn requires that
an agent may also have to remove some beliefs in a revision. One possibility in this case would be
to remove all of the agent’s prior beliefs. However, this is clearly far too drastic, and so one would
want to stipulate that in some fashion the agent retains as many of its old beliefs as consistently
possible.
The upshot is that belief revision (and more broadly, belief change as a whole) is an area with
difficult and subtle problems. Research in this area can be regarded as beginning with the seminal
work of Alchourrón et al. (1985) (see also Gärdenfors (1988)), resulting in what has come to be
known as the AGM approach. In this framework, the focus was on the belief change operators of
revision, in which an agent alters its beliefs to incorporate a new formula, and contraction, in which
an agent reduces its stock of beliefs so that a given formula is not believed. In this approach, as we
review in the next section, postulates are provided, which express principles that arguably should
govern any rational change operator, as well as formal constructions that express how one may
build a specific change operator. These two notions are tied together by providing representation
results that prove that the class of change functions captured by a set of postulates is exactly that
given in the corresponding construction. The resulting framework has, since its inception, been
the central pillar and focus of research in belief change (Peppas 2008).
A key assumption of the AGM approach, and the point that will concern us here, is that the logic
underlying the agent’s knowledge base at least contains classical propositional logic. On the one
hand, this seems to be a quite reasonable assumption; after all, classical propositional logic is often
seen as being very basic and lacking in expressivity. However, on the other hand, this apparent
simplicity is deceptive. The best propositional reasoners take exponential time in the worst case,
and general consensus is that this won’t change (given that the satisfiability problem of propositional logic is NP complete). As well, full classical negation and disjunction are sometimes seen as
being undesirable, particularly when moving toward a first-order formalism. Yet other approaches
employ nonclassical notions of, for example, negation, and resist an easy comparison with classical
propositional logic. What this means is that in artificial intelligence in general, and knowledge representation in particular, there has been extensive work on representation formalisms that don’t
subsume classical propositional logic, including work in Horn clause reasoners, description logics,
extended logic programs, and others. And so what this also means is that the AGM framework for
belief change is inapplicable in these approaches.
This has led to the study of AGM-style belief change with respect to systems that do not subsume propositional logic. The focus of much of this work has been on belief change in Horn theories, including belief contraction and belief revision. In particular, Delgrande and Peppas (2015)
reconstructs full AGM-style belief revision in the context of propositional Horn theories. As a result, while the AGM approach assumes that the underlying logic subsumes classical propositional
logic, it is clear that this is not a necessary condition.
In the present article, we consider the question of just what the minimal restrictions are that
need to be placed on a logic to be able to define AGM-style revision in that logic. It proves to be

the case that very little needs to be assumed to provide a sufficient setting for defining revision.
Essentially, we assume that we have a language (although we assume nothing about the structure
of the language), and that we have a set of models, and a function that specifies, for each formula,
the set of models that satisfy the formula.
While we work within a very general setting, we show that, nonetheless, a fundamental semantic characterization of belief revision based on the notion of a faithful ranking (Katsuno and
Mendelzon 1991) can be suitably defined in our approach. However, in the general case, an additional constraint that we call regularity is imposed on faithful rankings. Notably, this condition is
redundant when the underlying logic subsumes classical propositional logic. As well, we provide
a set of postulates that corresponds to the standard AGM revision postulates. Similar to faithful
rankings, an additional postulate, that we call (Acyc), is required. Again, this postulate is redundant in the case of propositional logic. These two characterizations are proven to be equivalent
via a representation result that shows that the class of general revision functions conforming to
the augmented postulate set is the same as those expressible by regular faithful rankings. We also
consider iterated belief revision, showing that the Darwiche-Pearl postulates (Darwiche and Pearl
1997) are consistent with the general approach to revision.
Subsequently, various specific instances of the approach are discussed. Classical propositional
logic and Horn clause logic are first viewed, briefly, as instances of this approach. Following this, we
review belief revision in various classes of extended logic programs. Last, we develop an approach
called literal revision, where the underlying formal system is perhaps the simplest approach that
could reasonably be called a logic. In this last system, an agent’s belief set is equivalent to a set of
propositional literals, and the task is to consistently revise by a formula expressed as a conjunction
of literals. Since the defined system satisfies our set of assumptions, it follows that a full revision
function can be defined, even in such an impoverished system.
These results are interesting for several reasons:
—Foremost, the AGM framework is extended to include any system that might reasonably
be called a logic.1 As described above, systems that do not subsume classical propositional
logic are playing an increasing role in knowledge representation. Notable areas of interest
include, among others, description logics (Baader et al. 2007) and the answer set approach to
logic programming (Gelfond and Lifschitz 1988; Brewka et al. 2011). The present approach
then implicitly defines AGM-style belief revision within such approaches.
—Consequently, our results provide a guide to the formulation of specific revision operators
in non-classical logics, including description logics, modal logics, many-valued logics, and
so on.
—In addition, our results provide a significant shortcut in developing representation results:
For any logic, once the language, model theory, and a notion of regularity are suitably defined, our representation result applies to that logic.
—Last, the approach sheds light on the foundations of belief change. On the one hand, it
demonstrates that the AGM framework, as least as regards revision, is much more widely
applicable than previously believed. On the other hand, our results indicate that when the
underlying logic is weaker than classical propositional logic, revision and contraction become distinct, independent change operations.
The next section provides background and motivation: the AGM approach is briefly reviewed
and, following this, issues that may arise in inferentially weak systems are discussed. Section 3

the approach has been presented.

covers previous work concerning belief change in such systems. Section 4 defines the formal
framework, expresses the AGM approach in this framework, and provides a representation result. Section 5 addresses iterated revision; while the next section describes various instantiations
of the approach. Section 7 discusses issues raised by the approach, and the final section gives a
brief conclusion.
2 BELIEF CHANGE
2.1 The AGM Approach
The AGM approach to belief change (Alchourrón et al. 1985; Gärdenfors 1988; Peppas 2008) studies
change operators at the knowledge level, independent of syntactic issues such as how information
is to be represented in a knowledge base. It is assumed that the underlying logic contains classical
propositional logic. An agent’s beliefs are modeled by a deductively closed set of formulas, called a
theory or a belief set. Thus a belief set is a set of formulas K such that K = Cn(K), where Cn(K) denotes the closure of K under a consequence operator that subsumes classical logical consequence.
Belief revision is modeled as a function from a belief set K and a formula ϕ to a belief set K such
that ϕ is believed in K
, that is, ϕ ∈ K
. If ϕ is consistent with K (that is to say, ¬ϕ  K), then it is
simply added to K and the revision is given by Cn(K ∪ {ϕ}). This “adding” of a formula to a belief
set is usefully considered as a distinct operation, called expansion; it is defined by
K + ϕ = Cn(K ∪ {ϕ}).
The interesting case in revising by a formula ϕ is when ϕ is inconsistent with the agent’s belief
set K. Since ϕ is to be believed in the revised knowledge base, this means that (assuming that ϕ is
consistent) some formulas must be dropped from K before ϕ can be consistently added. In general,
there will be many ways in which K can be reduced so that ϕ can be consistently added—for
example, one alternative is to drop all formulas in K.
Clearly, such a revision function would, in general, be too drastic. This leads to the consideration
that a revision function isn’t arbitrary, but rather is assumed to be guided by various rationality
criteria. A key assumption is that of informational economy, that when revising beliefs, we want to
retain as much as possible of our prior beliefs. As a consequence, a rational belief revision operator
is one in which (among other things) a belief set K undergoes minimal change to incorporate a
formula for revision. Of course, a notion such as minimal change, at least as an English phrase, is
informal, and so part of the task of specifying a revision function, only partly addressed by the
AGM approach, is to formally specify what is meant by such change.
The AGM framework does not determine a unique revision function, but rather it specifies
constraints that a rational change function should satisfy; beyond these constraints the approach
offers no advice as to how a specific operator should be constructed. The overall methodology for
studying belief change is to approach a change operator from two directions: On the one hand, a set
of postulates can be given to characterise those properties that any rational change operator should
satisfy. On the other hand, a construction can be given to formally characterise the class of instances
of that operator. Then, ideally, the two approaches are shown to coïncide via a representation result,
showing that the approaches capture the same class of operators.
The AGM postulates for revision can be expressed as follows. Below, ≡PC and +PC stand for
logical equivalence and expansion, respectively, in a logic that includes classical propositional
logic.
(K*1) K ∗ ϕ = Cn(K ∗ ϕ)
(K*2) ϕ ∈ K ∗ ϕ
(K*3) K ∗ ϕ ⊆ K +PC ϕ
Journal of the ACM, Vol. 65, No. 5, Article 29. Publication date: September 2018.    
General Belief Revision 29:5
(K*4) If ¬ϕ  K, then K +PC ϕ ⊆ K ∗ ϕ
(K*5) K ∗ ϕ is inconsistent only if ϕ is inconsistent
(K*6) If ϕ ≡PC ψ, then K ∗ ϕ = K ∗ψ
(K*7) K ∗ (ϕ ∧ψ ) ⊆ (K ∗ ϕ) +PC ψ
(K*8) If ¬ψ  K ∗ ϕ, then (K ∗ ϕ) +PC ψ ⊆ K ∗ (ϕ ∧ψ )
The first six postulates are called the basic postulates, while the last two are called the supplementary postulates. The first two postulates assert that the result of revising K by ϕ yields a belief
set (K*1) in which ϕ is believed (K*2). (K*3) and (K*4) assert that if a formula for revision is consistent with a belief set K, then revision consists of the expansion of K by ϕ. (K*5) says that unless ϕ
is inconsistent, K ∗ ϕ is consistent. (If ϕ is inconsistent, then (K*2) requires the result to be inconsistent.) (K*6) asserts that revision is independent of the syntactic form of the formula for revision.
The last two postulates deal with the relation between revising by a conjunction and expansion:
whenever consistent, revision by a conjunction corresponds to revision by one conjunct and expansion by the other. Postulates (K*3) and (K*4), and (K*7) and (K*8), can be seen as expressing
that in a revision as little information is removed from K as is consistently possible. Further motivation for these postulates can be found in Gärdenfors (1988) and Peppas (2008). We shall call any
function ∗ that satisfies (K*1)–(K*8) an AGM revision function.
Grove (1988) provided a possible worlds characterization of revision functions, based in turn on
David Lewis’s system of spheres (Lewis 1973). We shall deviate slightly from Grove’s terminology
and instead of systems of spheres we shall be working with total preorders over propositional
interpretations, or possible worlds.
2
First, recall that a preorder 	 (here, over possible worlds) is a reflexive, transitive, binary relation
on the set of possible worlds M. The relation 	 is called total iff for allw1,w2 ∈ M, eitherw1 	 w2
or w2 	 w1.
For a subset S of M, we say that a world w is minimal in S with respect to 	 iff w ∈ S and for
all w ∈ S, w 	 w entails w 	 w
. We denote the set of minimal elements of S with respect to 	
by min(S, 	):
min(S, 	) = {w ∈ S | for all w ∈ S, if w 	 w then w 	 w
}.
We say that a preorder 	 over M is faithful with respect to a theory K iff3
(F1) 	 is total
(F2) if [K]  ∅, then min(M, 	) = [K].
Intuitively, w1 	 w2 if w1 is at least as plausible as w2. Grove also provides an additional condition, corresponding to the limit assumption of Lewis (1973):
(S4) for any consistent sentence ϕ, min([ϕ], 	)  ∅.
This condition is only needed in the infinite case; since we will assume that the set of possible
worlds is finite, we will not require such a condition. Grove then provides the following representation result (modulo the different terminology), where t(S) is the set of formulas of classical logic
true in the set of possible worlds S:
Theorem 2.1 (Grove 1988). Let K be a theory and * a revision function. Then ∗ satisfies postulates
(K*1)–(K*8) at K iff there exists a preorder 	 over M that is faithful to K and satisfies (S4), and
2The two constructs are equivalent for the purpose of constructing a revision function. This was already noted by Katsuno
and Mendelzon (1991), who also first suggested expressing a possible worlds characterization in terms of a total preorder
rather than a Lewis-style system of spheres.
3We use [·] to represent the set of possible worlds associated to a theory K or a formula ϕ; a formal definition is given in
Section 4. For the time being, [·] can be thought of as a set of classical models.

such that
K ∗ ϕ = t(min([ϕ], 	)). (1)
Thus the revision ofK by ϕ is characterized by the set of those models of ϕ that are most plausible
according to the agent.
Another form of belief change in the AGM approach is called belief contraction. Assume that
ϕ ∈ K and that ϕ is not a tautology. In contracting the formula ϕ from the belief set K, denoted
K − ϕ, the agent no longer believes ϕ (while not necessarily believing ¬ϕ). That is, if ϕ is not a
tautology, then one requires that ϕ  K − ϕ. Informally, contraction is thought of as being a more
basic (or fundamental) operation than revision, since, in contraction, an agent’s beliefs can only
decrease, while in revision, in the interesting case, an agent’s beliefs change.
However, it proves to be the case that in the standard AGM approach, revision and contraction
functions are interdefinable. Given a contraction function −, one can define a revision function by
the so-called Levi identity:
K ∗ ϕ = (K − ¬ϕ) +PC ϕ. (2)
Analogously, given a revision function ∗, one can define a contraction function via the Harper
identity:
K − ϕ = K ∩ K ∗ ¬ϕ. (3)
See Gärdenfors (1988) and Peppas (2008) for further details.
So, to conclude, our interests lie with AGM-style belief revision, which we have introduced
here, and with the goal of extending it to arbitrary logics. It is worth briefly discussing some
notions that we will not be considering. First, although we will allude to belief contraction, it is
not our focus, and we do not consider the interesting question of AGM-style belief contraction.
Second, an intuition underlying belief revision is that the agent is receiving information about
some domain, but where the domain itself is unchanging. An alternative intuition is that an agent
receives information about a change in the domain; this leads to a different class of operators, called
belief update (Katsuno and Mendelzon 1992). It seems likely that the techniques developed here
could be applied without difficulty to belief update, although we do not do so in this article. Last,
we mentioned that the AGM framework is described at the knowledge level wherein presumably
irrelevant syntactic concerns are ignored, and wherein an agent’s beliefs are given by a belief
set. An alternative is to take syntax into account. In this case, distinct but logically equivalent
knowledge bases may behave differently under revision by the same formula. This leads to the
notion of belief base revision (Hansson 1999), which again we do not consider here.
2.2 AGM Revision and Classical Propositional Logic
In this subsection, we consider the question of why AGM-style revision requires that the underlying logic subsumes classical propositional logic. We do this by informally surveying problems
that arise in attempting to define an AGM-style belief change operator in an inferentially weak
system, where by “inferentially weak” we mean not having the expressivity of classical propositional logic. (So, this term includes both fragments of classical propositional logic, as well as those
nonclassical logics that do not subsume classical propositional logic.) In surveying problems that
may arise, we focus on Horn clause theories,4 and refer to other approaches as appropriate. While
we refer to Horn clause theories to illustrate the problems that may arise, it should be clear that
such problems may be expected to occur in other weak systems.
We begin with a review of some basic terminology. In classical logic, a clause is a disjunction
of literals. A Horn clause is a clause with at most one positive literal. A definite clause is a clause
4Some of this material is drawn from Delgrande (2008), Delgrande and Wassermann (2013), and Delgrande and Peppas
(2015).
Journal of the ACM, Vol. 65, No. 5, Article 29. Publication date: September 2018. 
General Belief Revision 29:7
with exactly one positive literal. A Horn clause ¬a1 ∨ ¬a2 ∨···∨¬an ∨ a can be perspicuously
written as an implication involving atoms only: a1 ∧ a2 ∧···∧ an ⇒ a. A clause with no positive
literal can be written a1 ∧ a2 ∧···∧ an ⇒ ⊥. A Horn formula is just a conjunction of Horn clauses,
while a Horn theory is a set of Horn formulas closed under a suitable notion of Horn derivability
(Delgrande and Peppas 2015). An example of a formula that is not expressible in a Horn theory is
p ∨ q.
Models of Horn formulas are distinguished by the fact that they are closed under intersection
of positive atoms in an interpretation. That is, if w1 and w2 are models of ϕ expressed as a set of
atoms then w1 ∩ w2 is also a model of ϕ. The converse is also true; that is, if a set of models W is
closed under intersection of positive atoms in an interpretation, then there is a Horn formula ϕ
such that the models of ϕ are W , and if a set of models W is not closed under intersection then it
is not representable in a Horn theory. For example, consider the formula p ≡ ¬q over the alphabet
{p,q}. The models of p ≡ ¬q are {p} and {q}, and p ≡ ¬q is not expressible using Horn clauses.
If, along with {p} and {q}, we include the model ∅ (= {p}∩{q}), then the resulting set of models
{{p}, {q}, ∅} corresponds to the Horn clause ¬p ∨ ¬q.
Consider now the issue of defining AGM-style revision with respect to Horn clause knowledge
bases. To begin, it can be observed that the simpler case, of definite clauses, is trivial. First, any set of
definite clauses is consistent (for example, just assign the value true to every atom). Hence, to revise
a definite clause knowledge base by a definite clause, one just adds the formula for revision to the
knowledge base and takes the deductive closure (suitably defined for definite clauses). However,
a set of Horn clauses may be inconsistent (for example, p and p ⇒ ⊥ are together inconsistent)
and so revision is nontrivial in the Horn case. These observations suggest that, for revision to be
meaningful, a logic must have some notion of inconsistency. These observations also suggest that
care must be taken when non-classical negation is encountered, as may be found, for example, in
an extended logic program; we will encounter an example in the next section.
So with Horn clauses, it would seem that we have a system, weaker than classical propositional
logic, that might nonetheless have revision defined according to the standard AGM definitions.
And indeed one can easily define faithful rankings and a set of AGM-like postulates in terms of
Horn clauses: Interpretations of Horn formulas are, after all, just the interpretations of classical
propositional logic. And a set of AGM-like postulates, rephrased in terms of a Horn-logic consequence relation, is straightforwardly specifiable. However, if one does this, it proves to be the case
that the standard representation results fail. Thus, it is possible to define an operator that satisfies
all the revision postulates (restricted to Horn formulas) but for which there is no corresponding
faithful preorder.5 Similarly, one can specify a faithful ranking for which the operator defined by
Equation (1) does not satisfy the (Horn AGM) revision postulates; see Delgrande and Peppas (2015)
for a counterexample. Essentially, these problems arise from the relative inexpressiveness of Horn
theories: full disjunction is missing, as is full negation.6
Similar issues may be expected to arise in other inferentially-weak systems. For example, many
description logics (Baader et al. 2007) lack full disjunction or negation. In perhaps the simplest
description logic EL, there is no notion of inconsistency and so revision is trivial in this case.
However, all description logics have a concept  that is true of all individuals, and most have
another concept ⊥ that is true of none. Given the standard (Tarskian) assumption that there is at
5Very informally, the problem is the following (Delgrande and Peppas 2015): In the case of propositional logic, given a
revision operator ∗, one determines that the least ψ worlds should be ranked “no lower than” the least ϕ worlds exactly
when K ∗ (ϕ ∨ ψ ) ⊆ K ∗ ϕ. But in the Horn case, if ϕ and ψ are Horn formulas, ϕ ∨ ψ may nonetheless not be a Horn
formula, and so this construction technique is inapplicable.
6That is, for a Horn formula ϕ, the negation ¬ϕ may not be Horn definable.

least one individual, a description logic knowledge base is inconsistent just if ⊥ is entailed;
that is, the top concept is subsumed by the bottom concept.
Thus, in inferentially weak logics, the direct adaptation of the AGM approach to revision may
be anticipated to be problematic. A plausible alternative is to first define a suitable contraction
function, and then define revision via the Levi Identity Equation (2). However, in general, this
strategy is also problematic. Consider again Horn theories. To begin with, there is more than one
way that one may define contraction. Informally, for a contraction K − ϕ there are the two notions:
K − ϕ can be defined as a subset of K that does not entail ϕ, or K − ϕ can be defined as a subset of
K that is consistent with ϕ; in symbols:
(1) If ϕ ∈ K, then one requires ϕ  K − ϕ.
(2) If K ∪ {ϕ} is inconsistent, then one requires that (K − ϕ) ∪ {ϕ} is consistent.
Note that in the second case, if the underlying logic contains propositional logic, we would have
¬ϕ ∈ K, and so the AGM contraction would in fact be expressed as K − ¬ϕ; in Equation (2), we
write K − ϕ instead, because in an arbitrary logic ¬ϕ may not be a formula.
These two conceptions of contraction are easily shown to coincide for propositional logic: For
the antecedents, one has
ϕ ∈ K iff K ∪ {¬ϕ} is inconsistent,
and for the consequents we have that
ϕ  K − ϕ iff (K − ϕ) ∪ {¬ϕ} is consistent.
However, for Horn clause theories these are distinct, simply because if ϕ is a Horn formula, then
¬ϕ may not be. (As a simple example, ¬p ∧ ¬q is a Horn formula, whereas ¬(¬p ∧ ¬q), or (p ∨ q),
is not.7) There has been extensive work in contraction in Horn theories (Delgrande 2008; Booth
et al. 2009; Zhuang and Pagnucco 2010, 2011, 2012; Booth et al. 2011; Delgrande and Wassermann
2013). However, such work either ends up with postulates that differ from the standard AGM set,
or else makes use of non-Horn clauses along the route to determining Horn contraction. What this
means is that, given the current state of research, it is not clear that an approach to contraction
for inferentially weak logic that follows the AGM approach is possible.
However, there is a more immediate reason why defining revision via contraction may not work,
and that is that, in general, the Levi Identity may fail, and so revision would not then be definable
in terms of contraction via this identity. Thus, in Horn theories, as well as in weak description
logics such as the EL family, the Levi Identity can’t be used since for an arbitrary formula ϕ in
one of these approaches, ¬ϕ may not be defined.
Informally, these results suggest that in inferentially weak systems, revision and contraction
become two distinct operations, in that they are no longer obviously interdefinable. In fact, with
contraction, it appears that while some semantic constructions in the AGM approach may be adaptable to weaker logics, others may not be so readily adapted.8 Moreover, to date the prospects of
coming up with a contraction function in such weak systems that satisfies the full AGM postulate
set are unclear.
It is of interest that, while a modification of AGM contraction to accommodate other logics is
uncertain, our results here show that this is not the case for revision. We show instead that the
7It is interesting to note that these two formulations for contraction differ in other ways. For example, the first makes sense
in a system with no notion of inconsistency (such as in definite clauses or the description logic EL) whereas the second
does not. Hence the first may potentially be useful in such logics, whereas the second would presumably be inapplicable.
8While it is beyond the scope of the present article, we can note that the approach of remainder sets appears to be naturally extendable to the Horn case (Delgrande and Wassermann 2013), while more effort is required to adapt epistemic
entrenchment to this case (Zhuang and Pagnucco 2010).

AGM approach can be adapted to apply in a very wide class of logics. Included in this class is Horn
logic, description logics, relevance logics, extended logic programs, and, more broadly, any system
that seems to satisfy a very basic notion of logic.
3 RELATED WORK
This section reviews related work that has been carried out in belief revision, focussing on what we
called “inferentially weak” logics in the previous section. Such work can be considered as belonging
to one of two broad groups. The first involves revision in fragments of classical logic, while the
second addresses revision in nonclassical logics. We also examine at the end of this section an
approach that addresses distance-based revision from first principles.
In the first group, perhaps the earliest work in studying revision in a system weaker than classical propositional logic is that described in Restall and Slaney (1995), where revision in the relevance
logic (Anderson and Belnap Jr. 1975) of first degree entailment, Efde, is studied. In Efde, a formula
may be true or false, as usual, but it may also be both true and false, or neither true nor false. As a
result, the so-called paradoxes of implication, such as ϕ ∧ ¬ϕ ⇒ ψ, do not hold. Restall and Slaney’s
work focusses on the semantic constructions, in particular those based on epistemic entrenchment,
partial meet, and systems of spheres. In each case, it is shown how a construction can be adapted to
the 4-valued semantics. In the case of epistemic entrenchment and partial meet, a revision function
is obtained from a contraction function via the Levi Identity. Interestingly, in the case of Efde, the
Harper Identity fails.
With regard to Horn revision, Zhuang et al. (2013) present a technique for obtaining a Horn
revision in terms of contraction. As previously described, the difficulty in defining Horn revision
in terms of contraction is that, in employing the Levi Identity, one must deal with the negation of a
Horn formula; this, in general, is not Horn. Zhuang et al. circumvent this difficulty by contracting
by a sequence of Horn strengthenings (Selman and Kautz 1996) of the negation of the formula for
revision.
As noted in the previous section, Delgrande and Peppas (2011, 2015) investigate belief revision
where the underlying logic is that governing Horn clauses. In these articles, the AGM approach
is augmented in two ways. First, a further postulate is added to the set of revision postulates.
This postulate, in semantic terms, rules out certain undesirable circularities among possible world
orderings. Second, a condition is imposed on faithful rankings to exclude certain undesirable orderings (i.e., orderings that would yield a result that is not expressible in Horn logic). Of key importance is the fact that both of these restrictions, while necessary for the Horn case, are redundant
in the standard AGM approach. A representation result shows that the class of revision functions
captured by these restricted faithful rankings is precisely that given by the (extended) set of Horn
revision postulates. Consequently, this article extends AGM revision to the inferentially-weaker
Horn case. Moreover it is shown that Horn revision is compatible with other work in revision,
including iterated revision and work concerning relevance. The present article then can be seen
as in part extending and generalising these results to arbitrary logics.
More recently, belief revision in other fragments of propositional logic, including Krom and
affine formulas, has been addressed in Creignou et al. (2014). However, the main focus of that work
is not concerned with representation results. Instead, the authors propose to adapt known revision
operators by means of a certain post-processing and then study the limits of this approach in terms
of satisfaction of the postulates. One of the main results of that article is that in this framework it
is not possible to keep Postulate (K*8) satisfied.
(Delgrande et al. 2013) addresses AGM-style revision in logic programs under the answer set
semantics (Gelfond and Lifschitz 1988; Brewka et al. 2011). This approach makes use of a standard,

monotonic (albeit non-classical) model theory based on the notion of SE-models (Turner 2003).9
Using techniques from Delgrande and Peppas (2015), it is shown how classical AGM-style revision
can be extended to various classes of logic programs by means of SE-models. That is, the AGM
postulates are rephrased to refer to logic programs; a semantic construction for revision operators
is given based on orderings over SE models; and then a representation result shows that these
approaches coincide. See also Schwind and Inoue (2013) for a related approach.
Recently, AGM-style revision has also gained interest in the field of abstract argumentation.
Here, the outcome of so-called argumentation frameworks (Dung 1995) is revised on the level
of extensions, see, e.g., Coste-Marquis et al. (2014). To guarantee that the result of a revision remains expressible as an argumentation framework, similar issues as recognized for Horn revision
come into play; a recent article (Diller et al. 2018) shows how AGM revision of argumentation
frameworks needs to be defined such that it is guaranteed to work properly within the restricted
language of argumentation frameworks. In these articles, the outcomes of argumentation frameworks are treated like models of propositional formulas which obey certain restrictions. Using a
completely different recent approach, Baumann and Brewka (2015) develop a weaker logic to study
revision of argumentation frameworks; this approach is closer to the SE-model-based revision in
logic programming (where, likewise, a weaker monotonic logic underlying the nonmonotonic semantics of logic programming is taken as a base logic for formalizing belief change).
Regarding belief revision in general, Gabbay et al. (2008) tackles a somewhat different problem
than that addressed here. For a non-classical logic whose semantics can be axiomatized in firstorder logic, they show how a revision operator for classical logic can be used to define a revision
operator in the non-classical logic. This is done by translating a belief set and formula expressed
in the non-classical logic, along with an axiomatic specification of the logic, into classical logic.
The (standard, AGM) revision operator is applied to the resulting theory; and the results are subsequently re-expressed in the original logic. The overall result then is a methodology for “exporting”
an AGM revision operator in classical logic to non-classical logics. This methodology has recently
been applied also to Horn logic (Brewka et al. 2016).
Ribeiro and Wassermann (2014) consider revision in non-classical logics. Their approach is to
begin with the basic AGM postulates, and then consider additional postulates (in place of (K*7)
and (K*8)) that would express a notion of minimality. Two constructions are provided, based
on the (contraction) constructions of remainder sets and kernels, and representation results
are provided making use of an additional postulate of relevance10 on the one hand, and core
retainment on the other. Last, Wassermann (2011) provides a survey of research on belief change
in non-classical logics.
The work of Lehman et al. (2001) (see also Schlechta (2004) for further details and in a wider
context) also deals with foundational issues in belief revision. However, the focus of Lehman, Magidor, and Schlechta (LMS for short) is on distance-based revision: they assume that a fixed, global,
distance is given between all pairs of possible worlds. Once such a distance is given, an AGM revision function is implicitly specified for every set of possible worlds; as well, the results of iterated
revision are automatically determined by such a distance function. LMS begins by considering
the notion of “distance” broadly, as an abstract, algebraic concept. Once such an algebraic theory
is developed, it is then applied in the specific instance of distances between sets of models. Two
cases are considered. First, the notion of distance is not necessarily symmetric; this is developed
with respect to finite sets of models. Second they consider the case where distance is a symmetric
relation; this case allows sets of models of infinite cardinality.
9Without going into details, an SE-model of a logic program P is an ordered pair of classical models, satisfying certain
constraints and related to the classical models of P. 10For a thorough discussion of this, and other proposed postulates, we refer the reader to Hansson (1999).

There are some similarities between the current approach and that of LMS. Notably, both have a
postulate schema, called (Loop) in LMS and (Acyc) here, that rules out cycles of < relations between
worlds; these schemas in turn go back to the (Loop) condition in Kraus et al. (1990). As well, in both
approaches not all sets of models are representable by a set of formulas. In LMS, this is a result
of allowing infinite theories for symmetric distances; in the present approach, this results from
dealing with non-classical logics and fragments of classical logic. There are also major differences:
LMS gives a restriction of the AGM approach, in that certain revision functions are ruled out in
their approaches. The present approach is a generalization of the AGM framework, in that revision
is extended to arbitrary logics. The present approach is also more general, since nothing is assumed
about the underlying language, whereas LMS makes explicit use of disjunction. On the other hand,
we note that the LMS approach permits logics with infinitely many models (though confined to
symmetric distances between models), whereas our approach is limited to logics with finitely many
possible worlds.
4 THE APPROACH
In this section, we present our approach. The first subsection defines the general framework, while
the next subsection expresses the AGM postulates in this framework. The last subsection provides
a representation result.
4.1 Building the Framework
Our framework is built from three primitive entities:
—A nonempty (possibly countably infinite) language L. The elements of L are called sentences
or, equally, formulas. We shall use the last few letters of the Greek alphabet, like ϕ, χ, ψ,
..., to denote sentences, and the first few upper-case letters of the English alphabet, like A,
B,..., to denote sets of sentences. Nothing is assumed of the internal structure of sentences
(not even the Boolean connectives).
—A finite set M containing at least two members, the elements of which are called possible
worlds or simply worlds. Worlds will be denoted with the last few lower-case letters of the
English alphabet, like, r, w, ... Once again, nothing is assumed of the internal structure of
worlds.
—A function f from L to 2M. For a sentence ϕ ∈ L, we often write [ϕ] as an alternative to
f (ϕ).
With the above three primitive entities, we gradually develop the full framework. Let w be any
world in M, ϕ any sentence in L, and S an arbitrary set of worlds, that is, S ⊆ M. We say that
w satisfies a sentence ϕ, denoted w |= ϕ, iff w ∈ [ϕ]. Similarly, we say that S satisfies ϕ, denoted
S |= ϕ, iff for every w ∈ S we have w |= ϕ. Moreover we define
t(S) = {ϕ ∈L| S |= ϕ}.
It can be noted that, by definition, ∅ |= ϕ for any ϕ ∈ L, and therefore t(∅) = L.
Let A ⊆ L be an arbitrary set of sentences. We define [A] to be the set of worlds
[A] = {w ∈M| for all ϕ ∈ A,w |= ϕ}.
We shall say that a world w satisfies A, denoted w |= A, iff w ∈ [A]. Observe that, by definition,
[∅] = M. We shall say that A is consistent iff [A]  ∅. We say that a set of sentences B is consistent with A iff A ∪ B is consistent. Two sets of sentences A, B ⊆ L are said to be equivalent, denoted A ≡ B iff [A] = [B]. For ϕ,ψ ∈ L, we shall often write ϕ ≡ ψ as an abbreviation of {ϕ}≡{ψ }.
Journal of the ACM, Vol. 65, No. 5, Article 29. Publication date: September 2018. 
29:12 J. P. Delgrande et al.
We define the closure of a set of sentences A, denoted Cn(A), to be the set
Cn(A) = {ϕ ∈L| [A] ⊆ [ϕ]}.
A is said to be a theory iff A = Cn(A). Finally, for two sets of sentences A, B, by A + B we denote
the set
A + B = Cn(A ∪ B).
Up to now we have made no assumptions about the primitive ingredients L, M, and f of our
framework. To proceed further, however, we impose a simple restriction:
(Expr) For any two distinct worlds w,w ∈ M, there exists a sentence ϕ such that w |= ϕ
and w |= ϕ.
This restriction requires that the language is expressive enough to distinguish between any two
possible worlds. (Expr) has two important consequences. First, it ensures that no world satisfies
fewer sentences (set theoretically) than some other world. That is, if every sentence satisfied by
possible world w was also satisfied by possible world w
, this would mean that there was no sentence ϕ such that w |= ϕ and w |= ϕ. But this contradicts (Expr). Consequently, all worlds are in a
sense “maximal.” Second, (Expr) rules out incoherent worlds, that is, worlds at which no sentence
of L is satisfied. To see this, assume thatw is a world at which no sentence is satisfied. We have assumed that M contains at least two possible worlds. Letw be a world distinct fromw. Then (Expr)
says that there is a sentence satisfied by w, contradicting the assumption that w is incoherent.
The following auxiliary result will be useful in the forthcoming discussion.
Lemma 4.1. For any possible world w ∈ M, [t({w})] = {w}.
Proof. Let w be any possible world in M. Clearly, by the definition of t, w ∈ [t({w})]. Hence
what is left to show is that [t({w})] ⊆ {w}. Consider any possible world w ∈ M such that w  w
or, for our purposes,w  {w}. Then by (Expr), there is a ϕ ∈ L such thatw |= ϕ andw |= ϕ. From
w |= ϕ, it follows that ϕ ∈ t({w}). Hence from w |= ϕ we derive that w  [t({w})].
The following small results will be used extensively in the forthcoming discussion. They are
stated without a proof since they follow immediately from the definitions.
Proposition 4.2. For any sets of sentences A, B ⊆ L, and sets of worlds S,Q ⊆ M:
(1) [A] = [Cn(A)].
(2) [A ∪ B] = [A] ∩ [B].
(3) t([A] ∩ [B]) = A + B.
(4) If S  ∅, then t(S) is consistent.
(5) S ⊆ [t(S)].
(6) If S ⊆ Q, then t(Q) ⊆ t(S).
We observe that Cn(.) is a Tarskian consequence relation (Tarski 1936); that is, it satisfies the
following conditions:
Proposition 4.3. For any sets of sentences A, B ⊆ L:
(1) A ⊆ Cn(A). Inclusion
(2) If A ⊆ B, then Cn(A) ⊆ Cn(B) Monotony
(3) Cn(A) = Cn(Cn(A)) Idempotence
Proof. The proof of the proposition is obvious, with the possible exception of the containment
⊇ in Part 3.

For this part and direction, from set theory we have that, for any set of formulas A that [A] ⊆
∩{[ϕ] | [A] ⊆ [ϕ]}. By repeated application of Proposition 4.2.2 we have that ∩{[ϕ] | [A] ⊆ [ϕ]} =
[{ϕ | [A] ⊆ [ϕ]}] and so [A] ⊆ [{ϕ | [A] ⊆ [ϕ]}]. We observe that {ϕ | [A] ⊆ [ϕ]} is just Cn(A) and
so we get [A] ⊆ [Cn(A)].
[A] ⊆ [Cn(A)] implies that for every formula ϕ that if [Cn(A)] ⊆ [ϕ] then [A] ⊆ [ϕ]. We can
observe from the definition of Cn that we have: [A] ⊆ [ϕ] iff ϕ ∈ Cn(A). Applying this to the preceding gives that, for every ϕ, if ϕ ∈ Cn(Cn(A)), then ϕ ∈ Cn(A), or Cn(Cn(A)) ⊆ Cn(A), which
was to be shown.
4.2 The AGM Approach in the Generalized Framework
In the classical AGM framework, the epistemic input for revision was assumed to be a single sentence ϕ. Subsequently, the AGM framework was generalized to allow for (possibly infinite) sets of
sentences as epistemic input (Peppas 1996, 2004; Zhang and Foo 2001). Since herein we aim for
generality, we shall follow the later approach.
Postulates. A revision function ∗ maps a theory K (also called a belief set) and a (possibly infinite)
set of sentencesA to a revised belief set K ∗ A. For ease of notation, if A = {ϕ} for a sentence ϕ ∈ L,
we shall often use K ∗ ϕ as an abbreviation of K ∗ {ϕ}.
Assume that K is a theory, and A, B are sets of sentences, that is, A, B ⊆ L. The AGM postulates
for revision can be reformulated as follows:
(K*1) K ∗ A = Cn(K ∗ A)
(K*2) A ⊆ K ∗ A
(K*3) K ∗ A ⊆ K + A
(K*4) If K ∪ A is consistent, then K + A ⊆ K ∗ A
(K*5) If A is consistent, then K ∗ A is consistent
(K*6) If A ≡ B, then K ∗ A = K ∗ B
(K*7) K ∗ (A ∪ B) ⊆ (K ∗ A) + B
(K*8) If (K ∗ A) ∪ B is consistent, then (K ∗ A) + B ⊆ K ∗ (A ∪ B)
The postulates (K*1)–(K*8) are the well-known AGM postulates for revision, rephrased to allow
sets of sentences for the epistemic input. However, at the high level of abstraction at which our
framework is developed, a ninth postulate is (sometimes) necessary:
(Acyc) If A1,...,An are sets of sentences such that An is consistent with K ∗ A1, and for all
1 ≤ i < n, Ai is consistent with K ∗ Ai+1, then A1 is consistent with K ∗ An
If our abstract framework is instantiated to classical propositional logic, then (Acyc) follows
from (K*1)–(K*8) (see (Delgrande and Peppas 2015, Proposition 3)). In general, however, this is not
true.
Preorders on Possible Worlds. For defining preorders on possible worlds, we basically adopt the
definitions given earlier. The only notable difference is that, since now there could be sets of worlds
that are not expressible by any set of sentences, we need to be a bit more careful with the set of
minimal worlds that satisfy the input.
We shall say that a set S of worlds is elementary iff there exists a set of sentences A ⊆ L such
that [A] = S. The following proposition is immediate, but useful:
Proposition 4.4.
(1) A set S of worlds is elementary iff S = [t(S)]
(2) If w is a possible world, then {w} is elementary.
Journal of the ACM, Vol. 65, No. 5, Article 29. Publication date: September 2018. 
29:14 J. P. Delgrande et al.
Proof.
(1) For the right-to-left direction, the proof of the proposition is trivial: if S = [t(S)] then, by
definition, S is elementary.
For the opposite direction, assume that S is elementary. Then there exists a set of formulas A such
that S = [A]. Hence
Cn(A) = {ϕ | [A] ⊆ [ϕ]}
= {ϕ | S ⊆ [ϕ]}
= {ϕ | S |= ϕ}
= t(S).
Thus Cn(A) = t(S). Moreover, from Proposition 4.2, [A] = [Cn(A)]. Therefore, S = [A] =
[Cn(A)] = [t(S)] as desired.
(2) Lemma 4.1 states, for possible world w, that {w} = [t({w})]. Hence {w} is elementary from
the previous part.
Depending on the specifics of L, M, and f , there may, or may not, exist non-elementary sets of
worlds. For example, if our framework is instantiated to classical propositional logic with finitely
many propositional variables, all sets of worlds are elementary. However, if the framework is instantiated to Horn logic, then non-elementary sets of worlds exist even when there are only finitely
many variables.
A preorder 	 on possible worlds is called faithful to a belief set K iff it satisfies the following
conditions:
(F1) 	 is total
(F2) if [K]  ∅, then min(M, 	) = [K].
In addition, a preorder on possible worlds is called regular iff it satisfies:
(F3) for any A ⊆ L, min([A], 	) is elementary.
The first two conditions (F1)–(F2) are the same as those of the classical AGM framework. The
third condition was identified in Peppas (2004), where it is called (SD), as being necessary for
possibly infinite epistemic input. Subsequently it was noted to also be required in finite Horn
theories by Delgrande and Peppas (2015). Of course, in the context of propositional logic with
finitely many variables, (F3) is vacuous since all sets of worlds are elementary.
The function ∗ induced from a preorder 	 faithful to a theory K is defined as follows:
(	∗) K ∗ A = t(min([A], 	)).
The following example illustrates various aspects of regular faithful rankings. Assume that we
are working in Horn logic where P = {p,q,r}. Then the following is a regular faithful ranking
with respect to K = Cn({p,q,r}):
11
pqr ≺ p¯qr¯ ≺ pqr ¯
pqr¯ ≺
pqr¯
p¯q¯r¯
pq¯ r¯
pq¯r¯
. (4)
11For convenience, we occasionally will deviate from our standard set representation of interpretations (where the set
contains the atoms assigned to true), and write interpretations as strings of literals, where x¯ is just an abbreviation for ¬x.
Journal of the ACM, Vol. 65, No. 5, Article 29. Publication date: September 2018.  
General Belief Revision 29:15
As a subtlety, note that even though the set of worlds {pqr ¯ ,pqr¯ } is not elementary, the preorder
is regular. In particular, there is no set of Horn formulas A such that min([A], 	) = {pqr ¯ ,pqr¯ }, and
so (F3) is satisfied in this case. Defining the function ∗ via condition (	∗), we have that
K ∗ (¬p ∨ ¬q) = K ∗ ¬p = Cn(¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r)
and
K ∗ ¬r = Cn(¬r).
In some cases, distinct regular faithful preorders may induce the same function ∗. For example,
it can be verified that the preorder
pqr ≺ p¯qr¯ ≺ pqr ¯ ≺ pqr¯ ≺
pqr¯
p¯q¯r¯
pq¯ r¯
pq¯r¯
, (5)
induces the same function as Equation (4) at K. This would not be the case if the underlying logic
were classical propositional logic, where, for example, via Equation (4) we would have
K ∗ (p ≡ ¬q) = Cn((p ≡ ¬q) ∧ r),
whereas via Equation (5) we would have
K ∗ (p ≡ ¬q) = Cn(¬p ∧ q ∧ r).
So, at this point, we have two definitions of a function ∗, one in terms of postulates and the
other in terms of preorders over possible worlds. In the next subsection, we show that these two
notions coincide.
4.3 Representation Results
In the standard AGM approach, the preorder 	 would be faithful but not necessarily regular, and
the aim would be to prove that the functions induced from (	∗) coincided with those satisfying
(K*1)–(K*8). In our general framework, however, this does not hold, and to a large extent this is
due to the existence of non-elementary sets of worlds.
We illustrate the anomaly through a counterexample. Suppose that w0,w1,w2,w3 are distinct
possible worlds, and A1,A2,A3 ⊆ L are sets of sentences such that,
(i) w0 ∈ [t({w1,w2,w3})].
(ii) w1,w2 ∈ [A1] and w3  [A1].
(iii) w2,w3 ∈ [A2] and w1  [A2].
(iv) w1,w3 ∈ [A3] and w2  [A3].
An example of worlds and sets of sentences satisfying conditions (i)–(iv) can be easily constructed, for example, in Horn logic. In particular, assume that L is built over three propositional
variables p, q, r. As usual in Horn logic, we identify possible worlds with the set of variables they
satisfy. With this convention, definew0 = ∅,w1 = {p,q},w2 = {p,r}, andw3 = {q,r}. Moreover, define A1 = {p}, A2 = {r}, and A3 = {q}. It is not hard to see that all four conditions (i)–(iv) are indeed
satisfied.12
Now consider the pseudo-preorder over worlds depicted in Figure 1. The minimal world is w0
followed by a cycle of the three worlds w1 ≺ w2 ≺ w3 ≺ w1, followed by a linear order over the
remaining worlds.
12Conditions (ii)–(iv) are straightforward to verify. For condition (i), one only needs to recall that for any two worlds w, w
and Horn sentence ϕ, if w |= ϕ and w |= ϕ, then w ∩ w |= ϕ.

Fig. 1. An example for a pseudo-preorder.
Clearly, ≺ is not transitive and therefore not a preorder. Moreover, as shown next, there is no
total preorder 	 that is “revision-equivalent” to 	:
Proposition 4.5. Let w0,w1,w2,w3 ∈ M and A1,A2,A3 ⊆ L be possible worlds and sets of sentences respectively, satisfying conditions (i)–(iv). Moreover let ≺ be the binary relation defined in
Figure 1, and 	 its reflexive closure. Then there is no total preorder 	 such that t(min([A], 	
)) =
t(min([A], 	)), for all A ⊆ L.
Proof. Assume toward a contradiction that such a preorder 	 does exist. Clearly, by condition
(ii), min([A1], 	) = {w1}, and consequently, min([A1], 	
) = {w1}. This entails that w1 ≺ w2. In a
similar manner, from condition (iii) we derive that w2 ≺ w3, and from condition (iv) we conclude
that w3 ≺ w1. From the transitivity of 	 we then derive that w1 ≺ w1. Contradiction.
Despite the above result, it turns out that the function ∗ induced from ≺ satisfies all eight postulates (K*1)–(K*8).
Proposition 4.6. The function ∗ induced via (	∗) from the binary relation ≺ of Figure 1 satisfies
(K*1)–(K*8).
Proof. Postulates (K*1), (K*2), (K*3), (K*4), and (K*6) follow trivially from (	∗). For (K*5), let A
be any consistent set of sentences. We need to show that min([A], 	)  ∅. If w0 ∈ [A], then this
is trivially true. Assume, therefore, that w0  [A]. Next we show that at least one of the worlds
w1,w2,w3 is not in [A]. Assume on the contrary that w1,w2,w3 ∈ [A]. Then A ⊆ t({w1,w2,w3}).
Hence, since by constructionw0 ∈ [t({w1,w2,w3})], it follows thatw0 ∈ [A], which, however, contradicts our earlier assumption. Hence, we have shown that at least one of w1,w2,w3 is not in [A].
From the definition of ≺ it then follows that [A] has a minimal element wrt 	 and therefore K ∗ A
is consistent.
For (K*7) and (K*8), consider any two sets of sentences A, B of L. Observe that according to
Figure 1, K = t({w0}). If B is inconsistent with K ∗ A, then (K*7) and (K*8) are trivially true.
Assume, therefore, that B is consistent with K ∗ A; i.e., [t(min([A], 	)] ∩ [B]  ∅. Then clearly
[A]  ∅. Moreover, as already argued earlier, if w1,w2,w3 ∈ [A], then w0 ∈ [A] and consequently
min([A], 	) is singleton (namely {w0}). This is also the case, as can be easily verified from Figure 1,
if at least one ofw1,w2,w3 is missing from [A]. Hence, in all cases, min([A], 	) is a singleton. From
(Expr), we then derive that [t(min([A], 	)] is also a singleton. Consequently, from [t(min([A], 	
)] ∩ [B]  ∅ it follows that the unique minimal A-world also satisfies B. Therefore, min([A], 	) =
min([A ∪ B], 	) and, consequently, (K ∗ A) + B = K ∗ A = K ∗ (A ∪ B). Thus (K*7) and (K*8) are
true.
Proposition 4.7. The function ∗ induced via (	∗) from the binary relation ≺ of Figure 1 violates
(Acyc).
Proof. From Conditions (ii)–(iv) and the definition of ≺, we have that [K ∗ A1] = {w1}, [K ∗
A2] = {w2}, and [K ∗ A3] = {w3}. Hence, A3 is consistent with K ∗ A1, A1 is consistent with K ∗ A2,
Journal of the ACM, Vol. 65, No. 5, Article 29. Publication date: September 2018.                 
General Belief Revision 29:17
and A2 is consistent with K ∗ A3. From (Acyc), then we derive that A1 is consistent with K ∗ A3.
Contradiction.
It is informative to consider an instance of this example in Horn logic: Choose A1,A2,A3 ⊆ L,
such that13
[A1] = {w1,w2,w1 ∩ w2},
[A2] = {w2,w3,w2 ∩ w3},
[A3] = {w1,w3,w1 ∩ w3}.
Note that we can assume that w1 ∩ w2, w2 ∩ w3, w1 ∩ w3 are all different from wi (i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3})
and thus are of form wj for j > 3. Moreover, by the definition of ≺, it follows that [K ∗ A1] = {w1},
[K ∗ A2] = {w2}, and [K ∗ A3] = {w3}. Hence A3 is consistent with K ∗ A1, A1 is consistent with
K ∗ A2, and A2 is consistent with K ∗ A3. From (Acyc), then we derive that A1 is consistent with
K ∗ A3. Contradiction.
To this point, we have shown that directly applying the AGM approach to arbitrary logics is
problematic. On the one hand, the standard AGM postulates are not strong enough to rule out
cycles in an intended corresponding preorder on worlds. On the other hand, a revision function
defined in terms of an arbitrary faithful ranking over worlds may violate the AGM postulates. It
proves to be the case that by adding the postulate (Acyc) and by restricting faithful rankings to
those that are regular, we can obtain a representation result. We first show that any faithful regular
preorder satisfies the AGM postulates and (Acyc).
Theorem 4.8. Let K be a belief set and 	 a preorder over M that is faithful to K and regular. Then
the function ∗ induced from (	∗) satisfies postulates (K*1)–(K*8) and (Acyc).
Proof. Postulates (K*1)–(K*4) follow immediately from (	∗) and the fact that 	 is faithful
to K. For (K*5), let A be any consistent set of sentences in M. Then [A]  ∅ and, therefore,
min([A], 	)  ∅, which again entails that K ∗ A is consistent.
For (K*6), assume that A, B ⊆ L are such that A ≡ B. Then [A] = [B] and consequently,
min([A], 	) = min([B], 	). This again entails K ∗ A = K ∗ B as desired.
For (K*8), consider any two sets A, B ⊆ L such that B is consistent with K ∗ A. Then clearly
both A and B are consistent, and moreover we have [B] ∩ [t(min([A], 	))]  ∅ by assumption.
Since, by (F3), min([A], 	) is elementary, we derive from Proposition 4.4 that [B] ∩ min([A], 	)
∅. This again entails that min([A ∪ B], 	) = [B] ∩ min([A], 	). Hence K ∗ (A ∪ B) = (K ∗ A) + B.
Thus (K*8) is satisfied.
The argument above also proves that (K*7) holds if B is consistent with K ∗ A. If, on the other
hand, B is inconsistent with K ∗ A, then (K ∗ A) + B = L, and therefore, clearly, (K*7) is once again
satisfied.
Finally, for (Acyc), let A1,...An ⊆ L be sets of sentences such that An is consistent with K ∗ A1,
and for all 1 ≤ i < n, Ai is consistent with K ∗ Ai+1.
Since A1 is consistent with K ∗ A2, it follows that [A1] ∩ [t(min([A2], 	))]  ∅. Then by (F3)
and Proposition 4.4 we derive that [A1] ∩ min([A2], 	)  ∅. Hence there is an A1-world, call it w
1,
such thatw
1 	 r, for allr ∈ [A2]. Similarly, from A2 being consistent with K ∗ A3 we conclude that
there is a w
2 ∈ [A2] such that w
2 	 r, for all r ∈ [A3]. Applying the same argument (n − 1)-times,
we derive that there exist worlds w
1,...,w
n−1 such that for all 1 ≤ i < n, w
i 	 r for all r ∈ [Ai+1].
From the transitivity of 	 we then derive that w
1 	 r, for all r ∈ [An]. Finally, from An being
13Recall, for instance, our earlier example, where L is built over propositional variables p, q, r and we define w0 = ∅,
w1 = {p, q }, w2 = {p, r }, and w3 = {q, r }, as well as A1 = {p }, A2 = {r }, and A3 = {q }.

consistent with K ∗ A1, it follows that there is a minimal A1-world, call it w
1 , that satisfies An.
Moreover, from w
1 	 w
1 	 r (for all r ∈ [An]), it follows that w
1 is also a minimal An-world; that
is, w
1 ∈ min([An], 	). Since min([An], 	) contains an A1-world, it follows that A1 is consistent
with K ∗ An as desired.
The next theorem gives the converse result, that, for any revision function satisfying the AGM
postulates and (Acyc), there is a corresponding regular faithful ranking on possible worlds. The
full proof can be found in the appendix.
Theorem 4.9. Let K be a belief set and ∗ a revision function satisfying (K*1)–(K*8) and (Acyc).
Then there exists a total preorder 	 over M that is faithful to K and regular, such that (	∗) is satisfied.
Proof Idea. We progressively construct the preorder 	 alluded to in the statement of the
theorem. First we define, using K and ∗, a binary relation  over M for which we show that
[K ∗ A] = min([A], ) for all A ⊆ L. In general,  is neither transitive nor total (although it is
reflexive). The transitive closure of , denoted 	0, is clearly a preorder, but in general it is not
total. We therefore construct a series of extensions of 	0, denoted 	1, 	2,..., that preserve the
minimal elements of [A] for all A ⊆ L. The union of this series is denoted 	 and it is shown to be
a total preorder having all the desired properties.
5 ITERATED REVISION IN THE GENERAL FRAMEWORK
The previous section has shown that the classical AGM approach can be rephrased in a highly
general framework. In this section, we examine the Darwiche and Pearl (1997) approach to iterated
revision with respect to the general approach.
First, we note that the Darwiche and Pearl approach (or the DP approach for short) differs from
the classical AGM approach in an important aspect: revision functions apply to epistemic states
rather than to belief sets.
As already noted, a belief set K (alias theory14) represents the beliefs of an agent at a certain
point in time. An epistemic state, on the other hand, is a richer structure. It contains, in addition
to K, “...the entire information needed for coherent reasoning, including, in particular, the very
strategy of belief revision which the agent wishes to employ at that given time” (Darwiche and
Pearl 1997).
The belief set assigned to an epistemic state S is denoted by bel(S). Crucially, two different
epistemic states S, S
, can be assigned the same belief set, i.e., bel(S) = bel(S
). It is fairly straightforward to switch to epistemic states in our general framework.15 The main step is to introduce
two extra primitives:
—a nonempty set Σ, the elements of which we call epistemic states.
—a function bel : Σ → 2L.
Moreover, for Σ and bel to have their intended meaning we need the following two restrictions:
(Σ1) For all S ∈ Σ, bel(S) is a theory of L.
(Σ2) For every theory K of L, there is an epistemic state S ∈ Σ such that bel(Σ) = K.
14To be precise, Darwiche and Pearl (1997) follow the conventions of Katsuno and Mendelzon (1991) and model a belief
set as a sentence rather than a theory. Moreover, new input is also modeled as a sentence, rather than a set of sentences.
However, in the present context, where we assume only finitely many possible worlds, these differences are immaterial.
15We make this change to epistemic states only for this section, where we discuss iterated revision. For the rest of the
article, we move back to belief sets.

General Belief Revision 29:19
Conditions (Σ1)–(Σ2) are pretty much self-explanatory. (Σ1) restricts the set of sentences assigned to an epistemic state to be a theory. (Σ2) says that epistemic states are at least as rich as
belief sets; the same assumption is made, implicitly, in Darwiche and Pearl (1997).
Rephrasing Darwiche and Pearl in our extended general framework, a revision function ∗ is
defined as a function mapping an epistemic state S and a set of sentences A to an epistemic state
S ∗ A. Of course, the postulates (K*1)–(K*8), (Acyc) need to be adjusted accordingly. In particular,
each occurrence of “K ∗ X” in the postulates is replaced with “bel(S ∗ X),” and each remaining
occurrence of “K” in the postulates is replaced with “bel(S)”. Thus, for example, (K*4) becomes16:
(K*4) If bel(S) ∪ A is consistent, then bel(S) + A ⊆ bel(S ∗ A).
Having changed to epistemic states on the postulational side, Darwiche and Pearl make analogous adjustments to the semantic side. Following their lead, we now assign faithful preorders
	 to epistemic states (rather than to belief sets). Moreover, we define 	 to be a faithful (regular)
preorder with respect to an epistemic state S iff it is faithful (regular) with respect to bel(S).
With the above changes, the representation results connecting the postulates with the semantics (Theorems 4.8 and 4.9), also hold for the extended general framework. The reason is that
(K*1)–(K*8), (Acyc), regulate only one-step transitions; under this restriction, the distinction between epistemic states and belief sets is immaterial.
Consider now the postulates introduced in Darwiche and Pearl (1997), call them the DP postulates, to regulate iterated revision17:
(DP1) If A ⊆ Cn(B), then bel((S ∗ A) ∗ B) = bel(S ∗ B).
(DP2) If B ∪ A is inconsistent, then bel((S ∗ A) ∗ B) = bel(S ∗ B).
(DP3) If A ⊆ bel(S ∗ B), then A ⊆ bel((S ∗ A) ∗ B).
(DP4) If A ∪ bel(S ∗ B) is consistent, then A ∪ bel((S ∗ A) ∗ B) is also consistent.
The theorem below shows that, in our extended general framework, the new postulates
(DP1)–(DP4) are consistent with (K*1)–(K*8), (Acyc).
Theorem 5.1. Let S be any epistemic state in Σ. Then there exists a revision function ∗ such that
at S it satisfies (K*1)–(K*8), (Acyc) as well as (DP1)–(DP4).
Proof. See Appendix A.2.
Theorem 5.1 shows that our extended general framework is compatible with the DP approach.
Yet Darwiche and Pearl did more than just to show consistency between their postulates and the
AGM postulates. In particular, they provided a semantic characterization of (DP1)–(DP4) in terms
of constraints over faithful preorders.
More precisely, consider an arbitrary revision function ∗ and an epistemic state S. Denote by 	
the faithful preorder that ∗ assigns to S by means of (	∗). Moreover, for every set A ⊆ L, denote
by 	A the faithful preorder that ∗ assigns to S ∗ A. It was shown in Darwiche and Pearl (1997) that
∗ satisfies (DP1)–(DP4) at S iff the following constraints between 	 and {	A}A⊆L are satisfied:
(IR1) If w |= A and w |= A, then w ≺ w iff w ≺A w
.
(IR2) If w |= A and w |= A, then w ≺ w iff w ≺A w
.
16We note that Darwiche and Pearl work with postulates (R1)–(R6) of Katsuno and Mendelzon (1991), rather than the
original AGM postulates (K*1)–(K*8). As already mentioned, the difference is inessential. In fact, by using (K*1)–(K*8), we
have a completely uniform mapping of the postulates to the DP approach, instead of dealing with one of the postulates
separately, like Darwiche and Pearl need to do with (R4).
17As already mentioned, Darwiche and Pearl (1997) follow the modeling conventions of Katsuno and Mendelzon (1991)
and hence the DP postulates therein are formulated differently. The differences, however, are inessential.

29:20 J. P. Delgrande et al.
(IR3) If w |= A and w |= A, then w ≺ w entails w ≺A w
.
(IR4) If w |= A and w |= A, then w 	 w entails w 	A w
.
Unfortunately, this nice correspondence between (DP1)–(DP4) and (IR1)–(IR4) breaks down in
our extended general framework. We show this with a counter-example. We shall construct a
revision function that satisfies (DP1)–(DP4) but violates (IR2).
The counterexample is based on an instantiation of our framework to Horn logic built over only
two propositional variable p,q. The possible worlds of this instantiation are M = {pq,pq,pq,pq},
where each world satisfies the literals that appear in it.18
Let S be an epistemic state such that bel(S) is the closure under Horn logic, denoted CnH ,
of the Horn sentence ¬p ∧ ¬q; in symbols, bel(S) = CnH ({¬p ∧ ¬q}). Clearly, for any revision
function ∗ satisfying (K ∗ 1)–(K ∗ 8), (Acyc), we have bel(S ∗ {pq}) = CnH ({p ∧ q}). Now, consider
the following two preorders over M:
pq ≺ pq
pq
≺ pq
pq ≺pq pq ≺pq pq ≺pq pq
.
It is not hard to verify that 	, 	pq are regular and faithful preorders with respect to S and
S ∗ {pq}, respectively. Hence there exists a revision function ∗ that satisfies (K ∗ 1)–(K ∗ 8), (Acyc),
such that ∗ is associated with 	 at S, and with 	pq at S ∗ {pq}, via means of (	∗). Next we show
that ∗ satisfies (DP1)–(DP4) at S for A = {p ∧ q}.
Consider any set of Horn sentences B. For (DP1), assume that {p ∧ q} ⊆ CnH (B), and therefore [B] ⊆ [p ∧ q]. If B is inconsistent, then (DP1) is trivially true. Assume therefore that [B]  ∅.
Then [B] = {pq} and, therefore, min([B], 	) = min([B], 	pq ), which again entails bel((S ∗ A) ∗
B) = bel(S ∗ B) as desired.
For (DP2), assume that B ∪ {p ∧ q} is inconsistent. Then [B] ⊆ {pq,pq,pq}. If B is inconsistent,
then (DP2) is trivially true. Moreover, if [B] is a singleton, then clearlymin([B], 	) = min([B], 	pq )
= [B], which in turn entails bel((S ∗ A) ∗ B) = bel(S ∗ B). Assume, therefore, that [B] contains
at least two worlds. Next observe that there is no set of Horn sentences X such that [X] =
{pq,pq}. Consequently, the only possible values for [B] are [B] = {pq,pq,pq}, [B] = {pq,pq}, and
[B] = {pq,pq}. In all three cases, it is easy to see that min([B], 	) = min([B], 	pq ) = {pq}. Hence
bel((S ∗ A) ∗ B) = bel(S ∗ B) as desired.
For (DP3), assume that A ⊆ bel(S ∗ B). If B is inconsistent, then (DP3) follows immediately. Assume, therefore, that B is consistent. Then by (K ∗ 1)–(K ∗ 5), from {p ∧ q} ⊆ bel(S ∗ B) we derive that [bel(S ∗ A)] = [bel(S ∗ B)] = {pq}; moreover B ⊆ bel(S ∗ B). Hence, from (K ∗ 1)–(K ∗ 4),
it follows that bel((S ∗ A) ∗ B) = bel(S ∗ A), which again entails A ⊆ bel((S ∗ A) ∗ B).
Finally, for (DP4), assume that {p ∧ q} ∪ bel(S ∗ B) is consistent. Then, by (K*2), B is consistent,
and pq ∈ min([B], 	). Since pq is also the maximum world with respect to 	, we derive that [B] =
{pq}. Hence A ≡ B, and consequently, bel(S ∗ A) = bel(S ∗ B) = bel((S ∗ A) ∗ B). Therefore, {p ∧
q} ∪ bel((S ∗ A) ∗ B) is consistent, as desired.
We have thus shown that ∗ satisfies the DP postulates at S for A = {p ∧ q}. On the other hand, 	
and 	pq violate (IR2). In particular, observe that pq |= p ∧ q, pq |= p ∧ q, pq 	 pq, and yet pq ≺pq
pq.
18Recall that, for the sake of readability, for a literal x we shall often write x as an abbreviation of ¬x. Moreover, whenever
a sequence of literals appears in the place of a sentence, we take it to be the conjunction of the literals in the sequence; for
example, S ∗ {pq } is an abbreviation for S ∗ {p ∧ ¬q }.

General Belief Revision 29:21
The main reason the correspondence between (DP1)–(DP4) and (IR1)–(IR4) breaks down in our
framework is because of the existence of non-elementary sets of worlds. In particular, on the one
hand, with “non-elementariness” there could be more than one regular faithful preorder that is
associated with the same revision function ∗ and epistemic state S by means of (	∗). On the other
hand, the extra constraint of regularity for the preorders 	A may not necessarily be compatible
with (IR1)–(IR4).
In the rest of the article, we focus once again on one-step transitions and hence we switch back
to belief sets and to the general framework as it was developed before this section.
6 INSTANCES OF THE APPROACH
In this section, we consider various instantiations of the general approach with respect to specific logics. We begin with revision in classical propositional logic, noting that in this case, the
general approach reduces to the standard AGM approach. Subsequently, we review revision in
Horn theories, briefly considering as a special case revision in definite clause theories. Third, we
discuss revision in extended logic programs. While the model theory looks quite different from
that of classical logic, nonetheless it is straightforward to show that our results cover this class
of approaches. Last, we examine revision in what is arguably the simplest approach that may be
considered to be a non-trivial logic, in what we call literal revision.
6.1 Classical Propositional Logic
In propositional logic, our language LP is built from a finite set of atoms P = {p,q,... } with
sentences formed using the usual set of propositional connectives. The set of possible worlds MP
corresponds to the set of interpretations of LP , and the function fP , assigning sentences of LP to
sets of possible worlds is given by the standard satisfaction relation of propositional logic.
In this setting, the restriction (Expr) is trivially satisfied. Moreover, in this setting, the postulate
(Acyc) is derivable from the AGM postulates (K*1)–(K*8) (Delgrande and Peppas 2015, Proposition
3). Every set of worlds S ⊆ MP is elementary, in that, for any S ⊆ MP , there is a sentence ϕ ∈ LP
such that [ϕ] = S. In particular, in the proof of Theorem 4.9 we obtain for any worlds w1, w2 that
[B(w1,w2)] = {w1,w2}. Consequently, the relation 	 defined in the proof of Theorem 4.9 corresponds to the definition of 	 in Katsuno and Mendelzon (1991), where they show that 	 defines
a total preorder. The overall result is that restricted to finite propositional logic, we just need the
standard AGM postulates, all sets of worlds are elementary, and the soundness and completeness
results of Katsuno and Mendelzon (1991) go through. Hence our general approach reduces to the
AGM approach (as formulated by Katsuno and Mendelzon) when the underlying logic is a finite
classical propositional logic.
6.2 Horn Logic
We next consider revision in Horn clause theories. Basic definitions and issues were presented in
Section 2.2; as well, Delgrande and Peppas (2015) provide an extensive development of AGM-style
revision in Horn theories. Consequently, in this subsection we just examine Horn revision from
the perspective of the general approach. However, first we briefly consider a restriction of Horn
clauses, to that of definite clauses.
A definite clause is a clause (viz. disjunction of literals) that contains exactly one unnegated
literal. Hence a definite clause can be written as an implication a1 ∧ a2 ∧···∧ an ⇒ a where n ≥
0 and each ai , 1 ≤ i < n, and a are atoms. Thus, without worrying about formalities too much,
our language LD is the set of conjunctions of definite clauses, based on a finite set of atoms P.
The set of possible worlds would again correspond to the set of interpretations on the language.
Journal of the ACM, Vol. 65, No. 5, Article 29. Publication date: September 2018. 
29:22 J. P. Delgrande et al.
Definite clauses are expressively impoverished, in that any set of definite clauses is satisfiable.19
What this means for our general approach is that revision is still definable, but it becomes a trivial
operation. Thus, for any definite clause belief set K, the notion of a faithful assignment is still
meaningful, as is the induced function (	∗). However, given that any set of definite clauses is
satisfiable, this means that for any set of definite clauses A, [K] ∩ [A]  ∅ and so we obtain that
K ∗ A = t(min([A], 	)) = Cn(K ∪ A), which is a roundabout way of saying that, not unexpectedly,
while we obtain AGM-style revision for definite clauses, in fact it reduces to expansion.
Turning to Horn clauses, where a Horn clause is a clause with at most one unnegated literal,
things become quite a bit more complicated, in fact arguably more complicated than the case
of classical propositional logic. As reviewed in Section 2.2, a Horn clause can be written as an
implication a1 ∧ a2 ∧···∧ an ⇒ a, as in the case of definite clauses, but where a may be the falsum
⊥. In terms of the basic components of our approach, our language LH is that of Horn formulas
(that is, conjunctions of Horn formulas) over a finite set of atoms. The set of possible worlds again
is the set of propositional interpretations. As with propositional logic, our restriction (Expr) is
trivially satisfied. It proves to be the case that the postulate (Acyc) is required: with respect to
Horn logic, (Acyc) is independent of the postulates (K*1)–(K*8). As well, not every set of worlds
is elementary: if a set of worlds is closed under intersection of atoms true in an interpretation, it
is elementary; otherwise it is not. So in Horn clause theories, a preorder over interpretations is
regular, if for all sets of Horn formulas A, min([A], 	) is closed under intersection. Consequently,
we obtain a representation result for Horn clause theories with respect to the general revision
postulates on the one hand, and faithful regular preorders over possible worlds on the other.
6.3 Answer Set Programs
Answer set programming (ASP) (Gelfond and Lifschitz 1988; Gebser et al. 2012; Brewka et al. 2011)
is a major area of research in knowledge representation and reasoning. On the one hand, it has a
conceptually simple, declarative, theoretical foundation while, on the other hand, efficient implementations are available. We omit a full introduction to ASP here, but refer the reader to the above
citations; as well, Delgrande et al. (2013) is a full development of AGM-style revision in ASP from
first principles. So here we just describe how revision in ASP can be directly expressed using our
general approach.
As before, our language is based on a finite set of propositional atoms P. The language, LLP , is
that of generalized logic programs, where a generalized logic program over P is a set of rules of the
form
a1; ... ; am; ∼ b1; ... ; ∼ bn ← c1,...,cj , ∼ d1,..., ∼ dk , (6)
where ap,bq,cr,ds ∈ P and p,q,r,s ≥ 0. The operators “;” and “,” express disjunctive and conjunctive connectives respectively while the unary operator ∼ is default negation or negation-as-failure.
Two important subclasses of logic programs are given as follows. A rule r as in Equation (6) is called
disjunctive if n = 0; and normal if m ≤ 1 and n = 0. (For a normal rule in which k = 0, we are back
with a Horn clause.) A program is a disjunctive logic program if it consists of disjunctive rules only,
and a program is a normal logic program if it consists of normal rules only. Any logic program as
above induces zero or more answer sets, informally classical models of the program that satisfy
certain minimality conditions.
Our interests aren’t with answer sets here, but rather with the underlying model theory of such
programs. This is given by a standard, albeit perhaps intricate, model theory, based on so-called
SE models (Turner 2003). The set of SE models is defined to be, for a set of atoms P, the set of all
ordered pairs (X,Y ) where X ⊆ Y ⊆ P.
19For example, the interpretation that assigns true to every atom satisfies every definite clause.
Journal of the ACM, Vol. 65, No. 5, Article 29. Publication date: September 2018. 
General Belief Revision 29:23
This defines the language and set of models. The last component that we need to specify is the
mapping f from sentences in the language to possible worlds, in this case, SE models. For this we
need some additional terminology. A rule as in Equation (6) can be written
H(r)
+; ∼ H(r)
− ← B(r)
+, ∼ B(r)
−,
where ∼X = {∼a | a ∈ X} and
a1,..., am = H(r)
+, b1,...,bn = H(r)
−,
c1,...,cj = B(r)
+, d1,...,dk = B(r)
−.
The reduct of a generalized logic program Π with respect to a set of atoms Y, denoted ΠY , is the
set of rules:
{H(r)
+ ← B(r)
+ | r ∈ Π, H(r)
− ⊆ Y, B(r)
− ∩ Y = ∅}.
Note that the reduct consists of negation-free rules only. Informally, Y can be thought of as a guess
of a model of Π, and the reduct is composed of the rules in Π where the default negations have
been “compiled out.” An SE model (X,Y ) is an SE model of Π iff Y |= Π and X |= ΠY , where |= is
the satisfaction relation in classical propositional logic.
So, this defines the three major components required in our general approach to revision: the
language, set of possible worlds, and satisfaction relation. While it is quite a bit more complex
than the previously described instances of the approach (and indeed won’t make a whole lot of
intuitive sense to someone not passingly familiar with ASP), it nonetheless fits within our general
specification of a “logic.”
Continuing, it turns out that the notion of an elementary set of worlds is non-trivial in ASP, in
that there are sets of SE models S for which there is no program Π where [Π] = S. For the classes
of programs that we are interested in, we have the following constraints on sets of SE models:
A set of SE models S is elementary:20
—in the class of generalized logic programs, if (X,Y ) ∈ S implies (Y,Y ) ∈ S;
—in the class of disjunctive logic programs, if S is elementary in the class of generalized
programs and if (X,Y ) ∈ S and (Z,Z) ∈ S, where Y ⊆ Z then (X,Z) ∈ S; and
—in the class of normal logic programs, if S is elementary in the class of disjunctive programs
and if (X,Z), (Y,Z) ∈ S then (X ∩ Y,Z) ∈ S.
With this we are done: We can apply Theorems 4.8 and 4.9, obtaining a representation result for
AGM-style revision in these three classes of answer set programs.
6.4 Literal Revision
Our last instance of the general approach is of independent interest, in that it illustrates that AGM
revision is definable even in extremely weak (albeit non-trivial) logics. To motivate this instance,
we can ask “what is the weakest system that might reasonably be called a logic?” and then examine
the associated AGM-style revision function in that logic. Arguably, for a system to be considered
a non-trivial logic, it needs some notion of inconsistency expressible in the language. This could
be given by a designated atom, such as ⊥ in Horn logic, or it could be given in terms of a notion of
negation. In this latter case, a set of formulas A is inconsistent if some formula and its negation are
derivable from A. To this end, assume that an agent’s knowledge is comprised of facts only, where
20The following conditions are referred to as well-defined, complete, and closed under here-intersection, respectively, in Eiter
et al. (2005) and Cabalar and Ferraris (2007).
Journal of the ACM, Vol. 65, No. 5, Article 29. Publication date: September 2018.
29:24 J. P. Delgrande et al.
a fact is an atom or a negated atom, and consequently in which an agent’s knowledge is given by
a set of literals. We refer to the resulting approach to revision as literal revision.
We need to first specify the three components of the general framework. As before, our language
will be based on a finite set of atoms P. The sentences of our language LL will be sets of literals
definable from P. Hence, for P = {p,q,r} sentences include {p, ¬q} and {p, ¬p,q}, which, as before,
we can abbreviate as pq¯ and ppq¯ . The set of possible worlds M will be the set of propositional
interpretations over P. The function f is defined as one would expect: for sentence ϕ, f (ϕ) is just
the set of interpretations at which ϕ is true.
A sentence ϕ is inconsistent just if ϕ contains complementary literals, and a set of sentences
A is inconsistent just if the union of members of A contains complementary literals. If a set of
sentences A is inconsistent, then Cn(A) = LL; and if A is consistent, then Cn(A) = P(∪A), where
P(X) is the power set of X. For two sets of sentences A and B, we can define a notion of logical
consequence by: A |= B iff A is inconsistent or (∪A) ⊇ (∪B).
In general, an arbitrary set of worlds S ⊆ M will not be elementary. For example, for P =
{p,q,r}, there is no set of sentences whose models is precisely {pqr¯ ,pqr ¯ }. It is straightforward to show that a set of worlds S ⊆ M is elementary just if [
w ∈S w] = S. Thus, for example, if S = {p¯qr¯ ,pqr¯ ,pqr ¯ ,pqr} then [
w ∈S w] = [{r}] = {p¯qr¯ ,pqr¯ ,pqr ¯ ,pqr} = S. In contrast, S =
{p¯qr¯ ,pqr¯ ,pqr ¯ } is not elementary; we have [
w ∈S w] = [{r}] = {p¯qr¯ ,pqr¯ ,pqr ¯ ,pqr}  S
. Given
this, our representation results apply and so we obtain a class of AGM-style revision functions
in this approach. It can be noted that while the formal system is trivial, the resulting set of revision functions is not; for example, for P = {p,q,r} and K = Cn({p,q}), the following is a faithful
regular preorder defining a revision function:
pqr
pqr¯ 	
pqr ¯
pqr¯
p¯qr¯
	 pq¯r¯
pq¯ r¯ 	 p¯q¯r¯.
Consequently, we obtain, for example, that K ∗ {¬p} = {¬p,r}. As well, the example illustrates
a subtlety about the approach mentioned earlier: neither the set of worlds {pqr ¯ ,pqr¯ ,p¯qr¯ } nor
{pq¯r¯,pq¯ r¯} as they appear in the total preorder are elementary.21 However, we don’t run into trouble in defining revision in this preorder, since the preorder is nonetheless regular; for example,
there is no set of sentences A such that min([A], 	) = {pq¯r¯,pq¯ r¯}.
Literal revision, while very basic, is of interest in at least two respects. First, it highlights aspects of the general approach while, second, it may also be of independent interest. With regard to
the first point, literal revision demonstrates that AGM-style belief revision obtains in a very weak
framework. The revision postulates are satisfied in this approach, and the semantic approach of
regular faithful rankings captures literal belief revision. In a certain sense also, these results show
that the AGM approach per se can be decoupled from the underlying logic, in that the AGM approach can be obtained even assuming a very primitive underlying logic.
As well, literal revision may be of independent interest, since there has been some interest
in proper knowledge bases (Levesque 1998), where a proper knowledge base is equivalent to a
set of literals. Arguably a proper knowledge base is the simplest kind of knowledge base that
allows open world reasoning. So, to the extent that proper knowledge bases are interesting, it
is an interesting question to ask how change can be managed in such knowledge bases. Literal
revision then addresses revision with respect to proper knowledge bases and demonstrates that
meaningful revision operators that adhere to the AGM approach are definable.
21For instance, the set {pq¯r¯, pq¯ r¯, p¯q¯r¯, pqr¯} is the least set of worlds containing pq¯r¯ and pq¯ r¯ that is elementary.

7 DISCUSSION
In this section, we briefly examine some of the underlying assumptions, results, and implications
of the approach.
At the outset, we suggested that the approach extends the AGM framework to any system that
might reasonably be called a logic, with the caveat that for us a logic was defined in terms of a set
of models and a satisfaction relation between models and formulas. Consequently, the approach
is inapplicable for a system for which a model theory has not yet been developed, or for one with
a non-standard notion of satisfaction of formulas.
However, it is interesting to note that the central constructions of the AGM approach are expressed essentially independently of a model theory. The approaches to constructing contraction
functions are expressed in terms of certain maximal subsets of a belief set (in the case of remainders) or in terms of an ordering over the formulas in a belief set (for epistemic entrenchment). In
Grove’s system-of-spheres construction of revision functions, “possible worlds” are in fact maximal consistent sets of formulas. To be sure, approaches have been developed with respect to models, best known being the Katsuno-Mendelzon formulation of revision. However, in the KatsunoMendelzon approach, a crucial assumption is made that the language, and the set of models, is
finite; consequently every set of models is representable by a formula.
We follow the Katsuno-Mendelzon approach in assuming that the set of models, or possible
worlds, is finite. Of course, it proves to be the case that, even with finitely many worlds, in arbitrary logics it no longer holds that every set of models is representable by a formula; this leads
to the notions in our approach of elementary sets of worlds and regular preorders. So, for us, the
assumption of finiteness helps accentuate the difference between classical AGM belief revision and
our approach.
On the postulational side, the schema (Acyc) provides a counterpart to regular preorders. Just
as one does not need to distinguish regular preorders in the AGM approach, so too is the (Acyc)
schema not required there. It can be noted also that the acyclicity postulate (Acyc) differs from the
other AGM postulates, in that it is schematically infinite, and it specifies a schema for every n ≥ 3.
This raises the question of whether (Acyc) might be replaced by a finite schema. However, Yaggie
and Turán (2015) show that the class of Horn belief revision operators require (Acyc), and cannot
be characterized by finitely many postulate schemas. Since Horn belief revision is an instance of
our approach, this means that a schematically infinite postulate is unavoidable. This is perhaps
not surprising, since the (Loop) schema in distance-based revision similarly cannot be finitely
characterized (Schlechta 2004; Ben-Naim 2006).
8 CONCLUSION
In this article, we have investigated belief revision in arbitrary logics, and we have shown that
AGM-style revision can be obtained even when extremely little is assumed of the underlying language and its semantics. This is done by adding a postulate schema (Acyc) to the usual set of AGM
postulates, on the one hand, and adding a constraint of regularity to preorders over possible worlds
on the other hand. Both of these additions are redundant in the original AGM approach. Subsequently, a representation result established a correspondence between operators satisfying the
postulates, and operators defined via minimal worlds in regular faithful rankings. The approach is
also shown to be compatible with the general Darwiche-Pearl postulates for iterated revision, and
several instances of the framework are given to illustrate the approach.
Consequently, AGM revision is extended to arbitrary logics, or at least to those based on a
notion of model and satisfaction of formulas. Conceptually then, revision in such logics can in
theory be addressed no differently than in classical logic. Expressed slightly differently, the AGM

approach provides constraints on a rational belief operator; what our results show is that (rational)
belief revision is definable essentially within any logic. This may not help immediately in the
development of a specific revision operator; however, the approach may provide a guide to the
formulation of specific revision operators in fragments of classical logic (such as Horn logic and
description logics), and non-classical logics (such as modal logics and extended logic programs).
In part, this is due to the fact that our representation result is applicable to any “reasonable” logic;
thus once one has specified a language, set of models, and satisfaction relation, the representation
results (Theorems 4.8 and 4.9) apply. To be sure, an appropriate logic-specific characterization of
elementary sets of worlds may be non-obvious; however, our formal results offer the possibility of
a very significant short cut in developing a representation result for logics (such as, for example,
in description logics or modal logics) for which revision functions have not been developed.
These results may also help to better understand the overall landscape of belief change, particularly the interrelation of different belief change operators. In the classical AGM approach, belief
revision and contraction are essentially two sides of the same coin, in that revision and contraction are interdefinable via the Levi and Harper identities. However, when the underlying logic is
weaker than classical propositional logic, these identities generally fail. Thus, when the underlying
logic is weaker than classical propositional logic, revision and contraction become distinct, independent change operations. Of interest then is to determine what relations exist between revision
and contraction in the context of arbitrary logics.

A PROOF OF THEOREMS 4.9 AND 5.1
A.1 Proof of Theorem 4.9
Let K ⊆ L be an arbitrary theory. We shall progressively construct the preorder 	 alluded to in the
statement of the theorem. First we define, using K and ∗, a binary relation  over M for which we
show that [K ∗ A] = min([A], ) for allA ⊆ L. In general,  is neither transitive nor total (although
it is reflexive). The transitive closure of , denoted 	0, is clearly a preorder, but in general it is not
total. We therefore construct a series of extensions of 	0, denoted 	1, 	2,..., that preserve the
minimal elements of [A] for all A ⊆ L. The union of this series is denoted 	 and it will be shown
to be a total preorder having all the desired properties.
In progressing from  to 	, we shall prove a number of supplementary results that will help us
establish the main line of the argument.
First some notation. For any two worlds w1,w2 ∈ M, we define
B(w1,w2) = t({w1}) ∩ t({w2}).
Clearly, w1,w2 ∈ [B(w1,w2)]. Moreover, according to the following result, B(w1,w2) is the
strongest set of sentences consistent with both w1 and w2:
Lemma A.1. Let A ⊆ L be any set of sentences and w1,w2 ∈ M any two worlds. If
w1,w2 ∈ [A], then [B(w1,w2)] ⊆ [A].
Proof. Assume that w1,w2 ∈ [A]. Let w3 be an arbitrary world in [B(w1,w2)]
and assume toward a contradiction that w3  [A]. Then for some ϕ ∈ A, w3 |= ϕ.
On the other hand, since w1,w2 ∈ [A], it follows that w1 |= ϕ and w2 |= ϕ; hence
ϕ ∈ t({w1}) ∩ t({w2}). Since [B(w1,w2)] = [t({w1}) ∩ t({w2})], we derive thatw3 ∈
[t({w1}) ∩ t({w2})], and consequently w3 |= ϕ. This of course contradicts our earlier conclusion.

We now define the binary relation  over M as follows:
w1  w2 iff w1 ∈ [K ∗ B(w1,w2)].
As usual,  denotes the strict part of ; that is, w1  w2 iff w1  w2 and w2  w1.
Lemma A.2. Letw1,w2 be any two worlds such thatw1  w2 and letA ⊆ L be a set
of sentences such that w1 ∈ [A] and w2 ∈ [K ∗ A]. Then we have that w1 ∈ [K ∗ A].
Proof. Let A be any set of sentences such that w1 ∈ [A] and w2 ∈ [K ∗ A].
Then clearly B(w1,w2) is consistent with K ∗ A. Hence by (K*7) and (K*8) we derive that K ∗ (A ∪ B(w1,w2)) = (K ∗ A) + B(w1,w2). Moreover, from w2 ∈ [K ∗ A]
and (K*2), it follows that w2 ∈ [A]. From w1,w2 ∈ [A] and Lemma A.1, it follows
that [B(w1,w2))] ⊆ [A]. Hence, [A ∪ B(w1,w2)] = [A] ∩ [B(w1,w2)] = [B(w1,w2))].
Therefore, by (K*6), K ∗ (A ∪ B(w1,w2)) = K ∗ B(w1,w2), and thus K ∗ B(w1,w2) =
(K ∗ A) + B(w1,w2). This, together with w1  w2, entails w1 ∈ [K ∗ A].
Lemma A.3. For all A ⊆ L, min([A], ) = [K ∗ A].
Proof. LHS ⊆ RHS
Let A ∈ L be any set of sentences and assume toward a contradiction that there
is a w1 ∈ min([A], ) such that w1  [K ∗ A]. From w1 ∈ min([A], ), it follows
that A is consistent, and therefore, by (K*5), [K ∗ A]  ∅. Let w2 be any world in
[K ∗ A]. By Lemma A.2, we derive that w1  w2. This again entails that w2  w1
(for, otherwise, w1 wouldn’t be minimal in [A]). Hence by the definition of ,
w1,w2  [K ∗ B(w1,w2)]. Since B(w1,w2) is consistent, from (K*5) it follows that
there is a world w3 ∈ [K ∗ B(w1,w2)]. Clearly then, B(w1,w3) is consistent with
K ∗ B(w1,w2), and therefore by (K*7) and (K*8), K ∗ (B(w1,w2) ∪ B(w1,w3)) =
(K ∗ B(w1,w2)) + B(w1,w3).
Next we show that [B(w1,w3)] ⊆ [B(w1,w2)]. Assume toward a contradiction
that for some r ∈ [B(w1,w3)],r  [B(w1,w2)]. Then for some ϕ ∈ B(w1,w2),r |= ϕ.
This again entails that ϕ  t({w3}), and therefore w3 |= ϕ. Notice, however, that
from (K*2), ϕ ∈ K ∗ B(w1,w2), which of course contradicts w3 ∈ [K ∗ B(w1,w2)].
Hence we have shown that [B(w1,w3)] ⊆ [B(w1,w2)].
From [B(w1,w3)] ⊆ [B(w1,w2)], it follows that [B(w1,w2) ∪ B(w1,w3)] =
[B(w1,w3)]. Together with (K*6) we then derive that K ∗ B(w1,w3)= (K ∗
B(w1,w2)) + B(w1,w3). Hence it follows that w3 ∈ [K ∗ B(w1,w3)] and consequently, w3  w1. On the other hand, from w3 ∈ [K ∗ B(w1,w2)] and w1  [K ∗
B(w1,w2)], we derive from Lemma A.2 that w1  w3; hence, w3  w1.
Finally, notice that from w1,w2 ∈ [A], it follows that [B(w1,w2)] ⊆ [A]. Then,
since we have shown that [B(w1,w3)] ⊆ [B(w1,w2)], we derive thatw3 ∈ [A]. This,
however, contradicts our assumption that w1 is minimal in [A] with respect to .
RHS ⊆ LHS
Let A ⊆ L be any set of sentences and let w1 be any world in [K ∗ A]. We
show that w1 is -minimal in [A]. Let w2 be any world in [A]. Clearly, since
w1 ∈ [K ∗ A], B(w1,w2) is consistent with K ∗ A, and, consequently, by (K*7) and
(K*8), K ∗ (A ∪ B(w1,w2)) = (K ∗ A) + B(w1,w2). Moreover, since w1,w2 ∈ [A], it
follows that [B(w1,w2)] ⊆ [A], and therefore, [A ∪ B(w1,w2)] = [B(w1,w2)]. Hence
by (K*6),K ∗ B(w1,w2) =K ∗ (A ∪ B(w1,w2)) = (K ∗ A) + B(w1,w2). Consequently,
from w1 ∈ [K ∗ A] we derive that w1 ∈ [K ∗ B(w1,w2)], and therefore, w1  w2.
Since w2 was chosen arbitrarily, it follows that w1 ∈ min([A], ).

Lemma A.4. If w1  w2  ...  wn  w1, then w1  wn.
Proof. If n = 1, the lemma is trivially true.
Let w1,w2,...,wn be any sequence of worlds, with n > 1, such that w1  w2 
...  wn  w1.
Thenw1 ∈ [K ∗ B(w1,w2)],w2 ∈ [K ∗ B(w2,w3)], ... ,wn−1 ∈ [K ∗ B(wn−1,wn )],
and wn ∈ [K ∗ B(w1,wn )]. Hence,
K ∗ B(w2,w3) is consistent with B(w1,w2)
.
.
.
K ∗ B(wn−1,wn ) is consistent with B(wn−2,wn−1)
K ∗ B(w1,wn ) is consistent with B(wn−1,wn )
and
K ∗ B(w1,w2) is consistent with B(w1,wn ).
Then by (Acyc), we derive that K ∗ B(w1,wn ) is consistent with B(w1,w2). Consequently, by (K*7) and (K*8), K ∗ (B(w1,wn ) ∪ B(w1,w2)) = K ∗ B(w1,wn )) +
B(w1,w2).
On the other hand, since K ∗ B(w1,w2) is consistent with B(w1,wn ), (K*7)
and (K*8) entail that K ∗ (B(w1,wn ) ∪ B(w1,w2)) = (K ∗ B(w1,w2)) + B(w1,wn ).
Hence, from w1  w2, it follows that w1 ∈ [K ∗ (B(w1,wn ) ∪ B(w1,w2))]. Consequently, since K ∗ (B(w1,wn ) ∪ B(w1,w2)) = K ∗ B(w1,wn )) + B(w1,w2), we conclude that w1 ∈ [K ∗ (B(w1,wn )], and therefore w1  wn.
Lemma A.5. For any A ⊆ L, if w ∈ min([A], ) and w ∈ [A], then w  w
.
Proof. Assume on the contrary that for some A ⊆ L, there arew,w ∈ M such
that w ∈ min([A], ), w ∈ [A], and w  w
. Clearly, then w  w. Consequently,
w,w  [K ∗ B(w,w
)].
Since B(w,w
) is consistent, from (K*5) it follows that [K ∗ B(w,w
)]  ∅. Let r
be any world in [K ∗ B(w,w
)]. Clearly, r  w and r  w
. From (K*2), it follows
that r ∈ [B(w,w
)] and therefore by Lemma A.1, r ∈ [A].
Next, observe that [B(w,r)] ⊆ [B(w,w
)]. To see this, consider any world r ∈
[B(w,r)] and let ϕ be any sentence in B(w,w
). Since w,r ∈ [B(w,w
)], we derive
thatw |= ϕ and r |= ϕ. Hence ϕ ∈ B(w,r). Then, fromr ∈ [B(w,r)], we derive that
r |= ϕ. This again entails that r ∈ [B(w,w
)]. Therefore, [B(w,r)] ⊆ [B(w,w
)].
From [B(w,r)] ⊆ [B(w,w
)] and (K*6), we then derive that K ∗ (B(w,w
) ∪
B(w,r)) = K ∗ B(w,r). On the other hand, fromr ∈ [K ∗ B(w,w
)] and (K ∗ 7)–(K ∗
8) we derive that K ∗ (B(w,w
) ∪ B(w,r)) = (K ∗ B(w,w
)) + B(w,r)). Combining
the above, it follows that [K ∗ B(w,r)] = [K ∗ B(w,w
)] ∩ [B(w,r)]. Hence, given
that r ∈ [K ∗ B(w,w
)] and w  [K ∗ B(w,w
)], we derive that r ∈ [K ∗ B(w,r)]
and w  [K ∗ B(w,r)]. That is, r  w. Since, as we have shown earlier, r ∈ [A],
this contradicts our initial assumption that w is -minimal in [A].
Let us now define 	0 to be the transitive closure of ; that is, w 	0 w iff there exist worlds
u1,...,un, such that w  u1 ··· un  w
. By construction, 	0 is reflexive and transitive; that
is, 	0 is a partial preorder. Moreover,
Lemma A.6. For any A ⊆ L, min([A], 	0) = [K ∗ A].
Proof. Let A be any set of sentences in L. Given Lemma A.3, it suffices to show
that min([A], 	0) = min([A], ).

From Lemma A.5, it follows immediately that min([A], ) ⊆ min([A], 	0).
For the converse, let w be any element of min([A], 	0). Consider any w ∈ [A]
such that w  w. Since w ∈ min([A], 	0) it follows that w 	0 w
. Hence
there exist u1,...,un ∈ M such that w  u1 ··· un  w
. Consequently,
w  u1 ··· un  w  w. Therefore, by Lemma A.4, w  w
. This shows that
w ∈ min([A], ).
An immediate corollary of Lemmas A.3, A.5, and A.6 is the following:
Corollary A.7. For all A ⊆ L, if w ∈ min([A], 	0) and w ∈ [A], then w 	0 w
.
If 	0 happens to be total, then in view of the above results it is easy to verify that it satisfies
all the properties required by the theorem. Assume therefore that 	0 is not total. Then there are
pairs of worlds that are incomparable with respect to 	0. Given that there are only finitely many
worlds in M, there are also only finitely many incomparable pairs of worlds with respect to 	0. Let
S1,... Sm be an enumeration of these incomparable pairs of world. We shall denote the elements
of Si as wi
1 and wi
2; that is, Si = {wi
1,wi
2}.
22 Moreover, we pick arbitrarily a world w ∈ M and we
define w0
1 = w0
2 = w.
Next, we shall construct a series of preorders 	1,... 	m, each an extension of its predecessor,
that preserves the properties reported in Lemma A.6 and Corollary A.7. The union of this series,
denoted 	, will be shown to have all the desired properties.
First, one more definition. We define д to be a function that maps any preorder 	i into a natural
number д(	i ) as follows:
д(	i ) =
⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪
⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎪
⎩
0 if 	i is total
the smallest number k such that
wk
1 ,wk
2 are incomparable wrt 	i otherwise
.
With the aid of the above definition, we recursively define the series of preorders 	1,..., 	m as
follows:
	i+1 = the transitive closure of 	i ∪ {(wд(	i )
1 ,wд(	i )
2 )}.
Clearly all 	i are preorders. Moreover,
Lemma A.8. For all i ≥ 0 and any A ⊆ L,
(i) min([A], 	i ) = [K ∗ A].
(ii) if w ∈ min([A], 	i ) and w ∈ [A], then w 	i w
.
Proof. We prove the lemma by induction on i. For i = 0, the lemma follows
from Lemma A.6 and Corollary A.7. Assume that the lemma is true for all 0 ≤ i ≤ k
(induction hypothesis). Next we show that it holds for i = k + 1 (induction step).
If 	i is total, then by construction 	i+1=	i . Hence, since by the induction hypothesis the conditions (i)–(ii) are satisfied for 	i , they are also satisfied for 	i+1.
Assume, therefore, that 	i is not total.
Let A ⊆ L be an arbitrary set of sentences. To prove Condition (i) it suffices
to show, due to the induction hypothesis, that min([A], 	i+1) = min([A], 	i ). If
[A] = ∅, then this is clearly true. Assume, therefore, that [A]  ∅. Then by (K*5),
[K ∗ A]  ∅, and, therefore, by the induction hypothesis, min([A], 	i )  ∅.
22It makes no difference which of the two worlds in Si is assigned the smaller subscript; the choice is arbitrary.

29:30 J. P. Delgrande et al.
First we show that min([A], 	i ) ⊆ min([A], 	i+1). Let w be any world in
min([A], 	i ). Then, by Condition (ii) of the induction hypothesis, it follows that
w 	i r for all r ∈ [A]. Since 	i+1 is an extension of 	i we derive that w 	i+1 r
for all r ∈ [A]. Hence w ∈ min([A], 	i+1), which again shows that min([A], 	i ) ⊆
min([A], 	i+1).
For the converse, we shall prove the contrapositive. Letr be any world such that
r  min([A], 	i ). We will show that r  min([A], 	i+1). If r  [A] this is trivially
true. Assume therefore that r ∈ [A]. Let z be any world in min([A], 	i ). Clearly,
r  min([A], 	i ) entails r i z. Next we show that r i+1 z. Assume on the contrary that r 	i+1 z. Then, since r i z, if follows by the construction of 	i+1 and
the transitivity of 	i , that r 	i wд(	i )
1 and wд(	i )
2 	i z. Moreover, by the induction
hypothesis, Condition (ii), z 	i r. Hence, wд(	i )
2 	i z 	i r 	i wд(	i )
1 , and consequently by transitivity, wд(	i )
2 	i wд(	i )
1 , which of course contradicts the definition of wд(	i )
1 ,wд(	i )
2 as the pair of worlds with the smallest index among those
that are incomparable wrt 	i . Thus we have shown that r i+1 z. On the other
hand, from z 	i r, it follows that z 	i+1 r. Hence, since z ∈ [A], we derive that
r  min([A], 	i+1). Therefore, min([A], 	i+1) ⊆ min([A], 	i ).
We have thus shown that 	i+1 satisfies Condition (i). For Condition (ii), consider
any w ∈ min([A], 	i+1) and let w be any world in [A]. Since, as already shown,
min([A], 	i+1) = min([A], 	i ), we derive thatw ∈ min([A], 	i ). Moreover, by Condition (ii) of the induction hypothesis, w 	i w
. Hence, since 	i+1 is an extension
of 	i , w 	i+1 w
.
We now define 	 to be the union of 	i for all 0 ≤ i ≤ m:
	 =
m
i=0
(	i ).
First we show that 	 is a preorder; that is, reflexive and transitive. Reflexivity is straightforward:
since 	0 is reflexive and 	0⊆	, then 	 is also reflexive. For transitivity, let w1,w2,w3 be any three
worlds such that w1 	 w2 	 w3. Then for some i, j ≥ 0, w1 	i w2 and w2 	j w3. Let k be the greatest of the two numbers i, j. Then by the construction of the series 	0,..., 	m, both preorders 	i
and 	j are subsets of 	k . Hence w1 	k w2 	k w3, and therefore, w1 	k w3. Since 	k⊆	 we derive
w1 	 w3.
Next we show that 	 is total. Assume on the contrary that there are two worlds r,r that are
incomparable wrt to 	. Since 	0 ⊆ 	, it follows that r,r are also incomparable wrt 	0. Hence for
some i ≥ 0, Si = {r,r
}. Observe that by the definition of д, we have д(	i+1) > i. Hence worlds
in S1, are comparable wrt 	i+1; and so are the worlds in S2, in S3, ..., in Si . That is, r 	i+1 r or
r 	i+1 r. Since 	 extends 	i+1 we derive that r 	 r or r 	 r. Thus 	 is total, and hence it fulfills
the first requirement, namely (F1), for being faithful to K.
To complete the proof, we need to show that 	, also satisfies (F2)–(F3), as well as (	∗). We start
with the latter. In fact, we shall prove something slightly stronger than (	∗); namely that for all
A ⊆ L, [K ∗ A] = min([A], 	).
Let A be any set of sentence in L. If [A] = ∅ then from (K*2) we immediately derive [K ∗ A] =
min([A], 	) = ∅. Assume therefore that [A]  ∅.
Consider any w ∈ [K ∗ A] and let r be any world in [A]. Then by Lemma A.8, w 	0 r, and since
	0⊆	, we derive that w 	 r. This entails that w ∈ min([A], 	). Hence [K ∗ A] ⊆ min([A], 	).

For the converse, let r be any world in min([A], 	). Since [A]  ∅, from (K*5) we get that [K ∗
A]  ∅. Let w be any world in [K ∗ A]. Clearly, by (K*2), w ∈ [A], and since, as already shown, 	
is total, from r ∈ min([A], 	) we derive that r 	 w. Hence, for some i ≥ 0, r 	i w. Moreover, from
Lemma A.8 and w ∈ [K ∗ A], it follows that w ∈ min([A], 	i ). Therefore, from r 	i w we derive
that r ∈ min([A], 	i ). Using Lemma A.8 again, we derive r ∈ [K ∗ A] as desired.
We have thus shown that for all A ⊆ L, min([A], 	) = [K ∗ A]. This clearly proves (	∗). Moreover, combined with (K*5), it also proves (F3). Finally, by setting A = ∅, from min([A], 	) = [K ∗ A]
and (K*3)–(K*4), we derive (F2) as well.
A.2 Proof of Theorem 5.1
As already noted, Theorem 4.8 also holds for the extended framework developed in this section.
Hence we can define the revision function ∗ alluded to in the present theorem in terms of total
preorders over possible worlds.
More precisely, let us denote by 	 any regular faithful ranking with respect to S. For every set
of sentences A ⊆ L we shall construct a total preorder 	A over M, which will be shown to be
faithful and regular with respect to t(min([A], 	)). The initial preorder 	 along with the family of
preorders {	A}A⊆L is then used to define a revision function ∗, which is subsequently shown to
satisfy (DP1)–(DP4).
Consider an arbitrary set of sentences A. If A is inconsistent, then we define 	A to be identical
to 	. If, on the other hand, A is consistent, then 	A is defined as follows:
w 	A w iff w ∈ min([A], 	), or w 	 w and w  min([A], 	).
According to the above definition, to construct 	A, one starts with 	 and simply moves the minimal A-worlds (with respect to 	) to the beginning of the ranking; everything else is unchanged.
We note that this construction is not new. It was proposed by Boutilier (Boutilier 1993, 1996) in
his treatment of iterated revision, which he called natural revision.
Since 	 is a total preorder, it is not hard to verify that 	A is also a total preorder over M,
regardless of whether A is consistent or not. Moreover, by construction it follows immediately
that 	A is faithful with respect to t(min([A], 	)). Next we show that 	A is also regular.
If A is inconsistent, then 	A=	 and hence (F3) follows immediately. Assume therefore that A is
consistent. To prove (F3), we need to show that for any nonempty set of sentencesC, min([C], 	A)
is elementary. From the construction of 	A, there are only two cases to consider: either min([C], 	A
) = min([C], 	) or min([C], 	A) ⊆ min([C], 	).
23 In the first case, since by assumption we have
that min([C], 	) is elementary, so is min([C], 	A). For the second case, from the definition of
	A, we have min([C], 	A) = min([C], 	) ∩ min([A], 	). By assumption, both min([C], 	) and
min([A], 	) are elementary, so there are sets of sentences B1 and B2 such that [B1] = min([C], 	)
and [B2] = min([A], 	). However, by Proposition 4.2, we have that [B1] ∩ [B2] = [B1 ∪ B2]. Hence
min([C], 	) ∩ min([A], 	) is elementary, and so min([C], 	A) is elementary.
Now define ∗ to be any revision function that assigns the preorder 	 to S, and 	A to S ∗ A for
every set of sentences A. According to Theorem 4.8, ∗ satisfies the postulates (K*1)–(K*8), (Acyc).
Hence what’s left to be shown is that ∗ also satisfies (DP1)–(DP4).
For (DP1), assume that B,A ⊆ L are such thatA ⊆ Cn(B). If B is inconsistent then (DP1) trivially
holds. Assume, therefore, that B is consistent. We distinguish between two cases. First suppose that
B ∪ bel(S ∗ A) is consistent. Then by (K*7)–(K*8) we derive that bel(S ∗ A) + B = bel(S ∗ (B ∪ A)),
and by (K*3)–(K*4) we get that bel(S ∗ A) + B = bel((S ∗ A) ∗ B). Moreover, from (K*6), we derive
23These cases arise from min([C], 	) ∩ min([A], 	) = ∅ and min([C], 	) ∩ min([A], 	)  ∅, respectively.

that bel(S ∗ (B ∪ A)) = bel(S ∗ B). Combining the above it follows that bel((S ∗ A) ∗ B) = bel(S ∗
A) + B = bel(S ∗ (B ∪ A)) = bel(S ∗ B) as desired. Now for the second case, assume that B ∪ bel(S ∗
A) is inconsistent. Then no B-world belongs to min([A], 	). Hence, by the construction of 	A it
follows that the restriction of 	 to [B] is identical with the restriction of 	A to [B]. Therefore
min([B], 	A) = min([B], 	) and, consequently, once again, bel((S ∗ A) ∗ B) = bel(S ∗ B) as desired.
For (DP2), assume that B,A ⊆ L are such that B ∪ A is inconsistent. If A is inconsistent, then
clearly 	A=	, and therefore min([B], 	A) = min([B], 	). This again entails bel((S ∗ A) ∗ B) =
bel(S ∗ B) as desired. Hence assume that A is consistent. From B ∪ A being inconsistent it follows that no A-world satisfies B. Then by the construction of 	A, it is not hard to see that
the restriction of 	A to [B] is identical to the restriction of 	 to [B]. This again entails that
min([B], 	A) = min([B], 	) and, therefore, once again, bel((S ∗ A) ∗ B) = bel(S ∗ B).
For (DP3), assume that B,A ⊆ L are such that A ⊆ bel(S ∗ B). If B is inconsistent, then (DP3)
follows immediately from (K*1)–(K*2). Assume therefore that B is consistent. Then by (K*5), so
is bel(S ∗ B). Hence from A ⊆ bel(S ∗ B) we derive that A is also consistent. Moreover, from A ⊆
bel(S ∗ B) we derive that min([B], 	) ⊆ [A]. This again entails that any B-world that is 	-minimal
in [A], is also 	-minimal in [B]. Hence, by the construction of 	A, it follows that the restriction of
	A to [B] is identical to the restriction of 	 to [B]. This again entails that min([B], 	A) = min([B],
	) and therefore bel((S ∗ A) ∗ B) = bel(S ∗ B) as desired.
Finally, for (DP4), assume that B,A ⊆ L are such that A ∪ bel(S ∗ B) is consistent. Clearly then,
by (K*2) both B and A are consistent. Moreover, from A ∪ bel(S ∗ B) being consistent, we derive
that there exists an A-world inmin([B], 	). This entails that any B-world that is 	-minimal in [A],
is also 	-minimal in [B]. Hence, by the construction of 	A, it follows that the restriction of 	A to
[B] is identical to the restriction of 	 to [B]. This again entails thatmin([B], 	A) = min([B], 	) and
therefore bel((S ∗ A) ∗ B) = bel(S ∗ B). Hence, since A ∪ bel(S ∗ B) is consistent, so is A ∪ bel((S ∗
A) ∗ B)
