We propose Silver Tape, a simple yet novel fabrication technique to transfer inkjet-printed silver traces from paper onto
versatile substrates, without time-/space- consuming processes such as screen printing or heat sintering. This allows users
to quickly implement silver traces with a variety of properties by exploiting a wide range of substrates. For instance, high
flexibility can be achieved with Scotch tape, high transparency with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), heat durability with
Kapton polyimide tape, water solubility with 3M water-soluble tape, and beyond. Many of these properties are not achievable
with conventional substrates that are used for inkjet-printing conductive traces. Specifically, our technique leverages the
commonly undesired low adhesion property of the inkjet printing films and repurposes these films as temporary transfer
media. We describe our fabrication methods with a library of materials we can utilize, evaluate the mechanical and electrical
properties of the transferred traces, and conclude with several demonstrative applications. We believe Silver Tape enriches
novel interactions for the ubiquitous computing domain, by enabling digital fabrication of electronics on versatile materials,
surfaces, and shapes.

1 INTRODUCTION
In the past decade, digital fabrication tools such as laser cutters and 3D printers have benefited not only manufacturers and suppliers but also researchers, makers, artists, and even children to fabricate their own designs. Such
tools allow users to play with a wide range of materials (i.e., paper, metal, plastic, rubber-like material, etc.) in
easy, fast, low-cost, and compact processes. Our motivation is to further extend the benefits of easy fabrication
and design freedom that digital fabrication allows for, and achieve a novel digital fabrication method of electric
circuits with both accessible processes and diverse material selection at the same time. For this purpose, the
inkjet-printed circuit [13] shows a promising potential due to its “sintering-free” printing process.
Typically, conductive inks for inkjet-printing require either a heat sintering or chemical sintering (known as
sintering-free) process in order to dry out or dissolve the polymer shell outside the conductive particles, which
prohibits the agglomeration of the ink. The heat sintering process requires additional equipments such as heat
guns or ovens to heat up the printed traces, which is relatively costly and time-consuming. Moreover, if not
handled professionally, such procedures can damage the printing substrates [13]. In this regard, the chemical
sintering process shows brighter advantage, since it offers relatively precise and highly conductive traces without
the need of expensive machines or non-reusable stencil sheets that are typically required by other methods such
as 3D printing or screen printing. However, conventional inkjet printing of silver traces with a sintering-free
process has been limited to the specially-coated paper that ensures the formation of bulk silver and good adhesion
of the traces to the substrate. This limitation has heavily restricted people’s design choices with this fabrication
technique, which prevents such techniques from being adopted in a broader spectrum of applications.
In this paper, we propose Silver Tape, an extension of sintering-free inkjet printed circuitry process, which
allows us to explore many types of materials as substrates for printing conductive traces, without losing the
benefits of its easy, rapid, low-cost, and compact nature. With our technique, users simply inkjet print the target

pattern onto Kodak photo paper (Kodak AZERTY5149), Fujifilm Paper Kassai Pro, or Epson premium photo
paper GLOSSY which are commercially available; customized Mitsubishi PET film, which is not yet commercially
available, apply substrates (i.e., Scotch tape, PDMS elastomer, 3D printed soft structure, etc.) on top of the printed
traces, and peel the pattern off for practical use. The applied substrates enable printed traces with corresponding
properties, many of which could not be previously achieved by conventional paper substrates.
The most significant yet simplest finding in this project was that we can transfer inkjet-printed silver traces only
when we use less sticky paper substrates as printing media whose property has been regarded bad for substrates
of inkjet-printed circuits – because less adhesive surfaces cannot maintain the silver traces against mechanical
scratches. However, we turned this undesired disadvantage of low adhesiveness of a substrate into advantages
by using less-adhesive surfaces as temporary transfer media. Table 1 shows a comparison that highlights the
novelty of our technique compared among other fabrication methods. We summarize the contributions of this
work as follows:
(1) We describe our method to transfer silver traces from paper to diverse sticky materials, along with a wide
range of transfer paper, sticky materials, and assembling techniques.
(2) We investigate the electrical property of multiple sticky materials, after they were transferred and applied
onto different materials and geometries.
(3) We demonstrate several applications of Silver Tape exploiting the versatile functionalities of different
substrates.
(4) We report a workshop which we ran to validate the accessibility of the technique and its potential design
space. Our key findings are summarized and discussed later in the paper.

2 RELATED WORK
Silver Tape intersects with several related research fields, which we summarize in this section. We start by
introducing conventional inkjet printing methods on paper substrates with a sintering-free process. We then
discuss conventional circuit fabrication techniques that achieve multiple properties by using different types of
Proc. ACM Interact. Mob. Wearable Ubiquitous Technol., Vol. 4, No. 1, Article 6. Publication date: March 2020.

substrates. Our proposing method aims to hold to a "middle way" of these two conflicting topics: rapid fabrication
with paper substrates versus functional fabrication with multiple substrates, combining the advantages of both
methods.
2.1 Inkjet Printed Circuits on Paper Substrates
Instant Inkjet Circuits [13, 14] can print highly conductive silver ink traces (approx. 0.2Ω /sq.) using an off-theshelf desktop inkjet printer for rapid prototyping. This method uses a specific type of silver ink and coated paper
from Mitsubishi Paper Mills [17] and realized sintering-free process and the strong adhesion of silver traces on
paper which users do not need any post-processing like heat sintering in the oven. However, only three substrates
are compatible with this technique: resin-coated white paper, translucent PET film, and white PET film, all of
which are limited in color, thickness (> 130 um), heat durability (they can endure only up to 120 ◦C), and water
insolubility – properties that are important in many application scenarios.
There are also some other ink materials which users can print with a desktop inkjet printer (i.e., PEDOT:PSS
[5, 30]). However, they require heat sintering post-processing and the resistance of the end results is too high
(i.e., around 900 kΩ/sq. [5]) to make general circuitry. As a result, sintering-free silver circuitry is considered
to be a more preferable approach for rapid prototyping. Previous work has demonstrated customizable touch
[4, 22], pressure [6], flex [32], and soil moisture sensors [14], antennas [28], extension of a touch screen for mobile
devices [12], interactive energy harvesting books [10], haptics [11], actuators [18, 23], and even 3D construction of
functional objects [21]. Recently, inkjet printed conductive materials have also been used as a low-cost fabrication
method for large-scale sensing interactions [33].
2.2 Fabricated Circuits on Multiple Substrates
There is a significant body of research in the HCI community which has explored methods of implementing
functional flexible circuitry on several different substrates (i.e., transparent, stretchable PDMS elastomer for onskin touch sensors [34] and electroluminescent displays [35]; conformable tattoo paper for multi touch sensors [9,
20]). Others adopted methods which are not restricted to the specific substrates: screen printed electroluminescent
displays on leather, ceramics, and even stone [24]. People have also demonstrated copper tapes/sheet circuits for
extension of touch screens [27], for low-tech fabrication [25, 26] and conductive sprays/paints for large-scale
touch/hover sensors [36, 37]. Recently, [15] introduces printed circuits with versatile functionalities by printing
with different inks including conductive, highly stretchable, isolation or even cleaning inks directly on temporary
tattoo paper, textiles, and thermoplastics, though it surely broadens the ink and printing material selections,
However, the selections are still limited to five different kinds of substrates, and all the printed traces need
to undergo a heat sintering post-treatment, which does not leverage the benefit of rapid prototyping with a
sintering-free inkjet process in [13]. Instead, our motivation is to keep a sintering-free process while allowing
multiple substrates.
Our approach is similar to those of sticker circuits which install circuit components on the sticker in advance
as an extension module [2, 8]. Here, our approach presents three core novelties: (1) we allow rapid prototyping of
fully customizable conductive traces with near-to-zero cost and an extremely easy fabrication process, as we
demonstrated with a toolkit study, (2) our method can support a wide range of substrate materials with unique
properties, and (3) our method transfers circuits not only to substrate films but also these films can be directly
applied onto a variety of everyday surfaces, which unlocks applications beyond previous possibilities.
Similar ideas of transferring printed circuitry from paper to other objects have also been demonstrated in
ObjectSkin [5]. This method achieved the circuit on non-developable surfaces by water-transferring unsintered
conductive ink to the surface of the object and heating it up for sintering after the transfer step. The most
significant benefits of our approach are that (1) we do not need any pre- or post- processes to transfer circuitry,
Proc. ACM Interact. Mob. Wearable Ubiquitous Technol., Vol. 4, No. 1, Article 6. Publication date: March 2020.
Silver Tape: Inkjet-Printed Circuits Peeled-and-Transferred on Versatile Substrates • 6:5
and (2) we do not need any additional equipment like a water tank. At the same time, our approach has drawbacks
that the precise transfer of the circuits is only limited to developable surfaces.
Finally, even though, in prior work, researchers have explored transfer printing techniques in the material
science community, special facilities such as CVD machine, annealing oven, cleanroom-/lab grade environments,
and pre-/post-processes are required [1, 3, 7, 16, 29]. Our approach provides comparable outcomes without special
equipment or complex procedures, which can be easily integrated into rapid fabrication routines.
3 FABRICATION PROCESS
The fabrication process of Silver Tape consists of three simple steps: printing (Figure 2a), transferring (Figure 2b)
and assembling. Instead of relying on additional heat sintering, our Inkjet-printed pattern becomes conductive
due to the chemical sintering reaction on the surface of the chosen temporary transfer paper. Additionally, our
method can be achieved with a standard desktop inkjet printer loaded with silver ink, and a wide selection of
sticky tapes, which is easy, fast, compact, and low-cost as we will describe in greater details later.

(c-e) Schematics of the transfer process of silver nanoparticles from transfer paper to a sticky substrate.
3.1 Printing
For printing silver ink, we used a desktop inkjet printer (Epson PX-S160T) and silver nanoparticle ink (Mitsubishi
Paper Mills NBSIJ-MU01) in order to carry out all the testings and applications. We adopted the printing method
based on the literature [13, 14].
For the printing paper selection, we investigated four different papers: commercialized glossy photo paper
(Kodak AZERTY5149), Fujifilm Paper Kassai Pro, Epson premium photo paper GLOSSY, and customized Mitsubishi
PET film, all of which are commercially available except the PET film. All four papers can cause a chemical
sintering process on the surface [13], and support the transfer process.
Proc. ACM Interact. Mob. Wearable Ubiquitous Technol., Vol. 4, No. 1, Article 6. Publication date: March 2020.

3.2 Transferring
We first apply the adhesive side of a sticky substrate such as a piece of tape onto a piece of transfer paper. To
facilitate a successful peeling/transferring process, we rub the tape gently to ensure a seamless contact between
the adhesive and the printed pattern, and then slowly peel off the adhesive.
Our method is compatible with a wide range of tapes, several of which we selected as examples for demonstration and evaluation next, including Scotch tape (3M Scotch 810), polyimide electrical tape (3M 1205), vinyl
insulation tape (3M Super 33+), Scotch transparent tape, water soluble tape (3M 5414), Scotch removable tape
(3M Scotch 811), and masking tape (3M Scotch 234) (Figure 3b) . We evaluated the above example substrates and
proved their compatibility with our method. We also observed that the low adhesion and rough surface of Scotch
removable tape and masking tape caused the silver nanoparticle residuals left on the printing paper after transfer.
We report the procedure and several key results of a comprehensive performance evaluation in the electrical and
mechanical analyses section.

Super 33+), (4) water soluble wave soldering tape (3M 5414), (5) Scotch removable tape (3M Scotch 811), (6) masking tape
(3M Scotch 234).
3.3 Assembling
After we transfer the patterns onto target substrates, we connect the conductive traces with other electronic
components. Figure 4 shows four common connection methods allowed by Silver Tape: (a) sticky tapes pasted
together with two conductive patterns in contact, (b) conductive paste (Bare Paint) /epoxy (CW2400) for permanent
connections, (c) fixing a stable, solderable connection with metal pierce punch (SK11 pierce punch), and (d) liquid
metal eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) for temporary connection to connect with, for example, the probes to
measure electric properties of the testing circuit.
3.4 Re-transferability
On top of printing, transferring, and assembling. Sometimes the transferred pattern might get damaged, for
example when overly bent or accidentally scratched which are likely to happen in reality but rarely considered
in previous literatures. Our technique allows users to quickly fix the damaged portion by re-transferring a new
trace onto the damaged part to recover the conductivity of the trace, or even using commercially-available
circuit erasers [19] to erase the unwanted part of the silver traces and retransfer with a desired one. In Figure 5,
we show that we partially remove the transferred pattern and replace with a new one. Figure 5e also shows a

microscopic image of the edge between the original and the replaced patterns, where the new replaced silver
trace is recovering the conductivity of the whole pattern by filling the removed portion and gets well integrated
into the original pattern.
4 ELECTRICAL & MECHANICAL ANALYSES
To better understand the transferring process and evaluate the electrical and mechanical performance of our
technique, we carried out several tests. We also summarized our key findings in this section to help predict and
guide the design procedures for researchers, makers, and hobbyists to adopt our method in their applications.
4.1 Transfer Resolution
We first tested the transfer resolution, which decides the widths of printed traces. An ideal circuit fabrication
approach should be high-resolution, able to provide thin traces to support fine-grained circuitry patterns. Figure
7a shows the transferred silver patterns with seven different widths we tested. In this test, we printed the
pattern in different widths on Mitsubishi PET film and transferred onto PDMS sheet. We took multiple trials and
measurements and found the thinnest pattern we could achieve was 0.1 mm. Traces less than 0.1 mm caused

6:8 • Cheng and Narumi, et al.
breakage. Note that the 0.1 mm resolution achieved by Silver Tape compares more favourably than the prior
work [13]. We speculated this difference mainly came from the high resolution of the printer we used.
Table 2. Resistance variance before and after transfer for different printing substrates.
Table 3. Resistance variance before and after transfer for different transfer materials.
4.2 Resistance Change Using Different Substrates
We investigated the resistance variance before and after transfer, where we used the same tape (Scotch transparent
tape) to transfer 7 mm wide traces (with a 50 mm length) from different printing substrates, including Kodak
photo paper, Fujifilm Paper Kassai Pro, Epson premium photo paper GLOSSY and customized Mitsubishi PET
film (Table 2). For each substrate, the pattern was printed and transferred 20 times, where we measured the
resistance of the traces before and after the transfer. Table 2 summarizes our results. We found that all the printing
substrates showed promising conductivity after transfer, while Fujifilm Paper Kassai Pro, Epson premium photo
paper GLOSSY and customized Mitsubishi PET film showed much smaller resistance variance before and after
transfer than the Kodak photo paper. We used the customized Mitsubishi PET film for the rest of the testings and
most of the applications. Comparing with the Fujifilm and Epson photo paper, the customized Mitsubishi PET
film, made by Mitsubishi Paper Mills, is providing a surficial "releasing layer" composed of non-sticky particles.
This releasing layer helps us peel the sticky substrate off the transfer paper surface more easily than from the
commercial photo paper, even they all provide the similar final electrical performances. The sample of customized
Mitsubishi PET film is also available as "Transfersheet" at E-mail: agnano@mpm.co.jp.
Proc. ACM Interact. Mob. Wearable Ubiquitous Technol., Vol. 4, No. 1, Article 6. Publication date: March 2020.

4.3 Resistance Change Using Different Adhesives
We also investigated the electrical performance with different adhesive materials when we used customized
Mitsubishi PET film as the printing substrate for all these tests. To facilitate others’ access to our technique,
we only used off-the-shelf tapes. We did an extensive search and purchased 14 different tapes we found on the
market. We used these tapes together with PDMS sheets, soft 3D printing material Tango Black plus to transfer
the designed pattern printed on the customized Mitsubishi PET film (Table 3). Following the same procedure
as the test before, we measured the variance of the resistance before and after the transfer. The pattern was
printed 20 times and transferred 20 times. Table 3 summarizes our results. As we can see, all transfer materials
consistently show successful transfer, whereas the highlighted transfer materials on the right side of the table are
showing relatively higher resistance variances mainly due to the stickiness difference or the surface roughness
level of the transfer materials. Additionally, we looked into the datasheet of these tapes and found that in order to
achieve a relatively smaller resistance variance, adhesion between 0.4N/cm to 6N/cm would be a good selection
range. Adhesion lower than 0.4N/cm could also show successful transfer but might result in bigger resistance
variance, while adhesion that is too strong might make the transfer material harder to be peeled off and result in
damaged traces.
4.4 Transfer to Everyday Surfaces
With the adhesive nature of the tapes, we can transfer and directly paste the conductive pattern onto different
everyday surfaces for real-world uses. In Figure 6, we show conductive patterns (i.e., 7 mm width, 50 mm length)
are transferred and pasted onto a wide array of materials including aluminum, glass, granite, wood, foam, fabrics,
and acrylic. From the microscopic images, we also visualized the connection of the silver nanoparticle when they
were on the tapes, and perceived some minor cracks which may have caused the increase of the resistance.
Fig. 6. Silver traces transferred onto different materials and geometries.
4.5 Transfer to Different Geometries
Besides different materials, we also tested how the resistance varies when we transfer the conductive patterns
onto different geometries. We drew three basic geometries – flex, corner, and twist, which exemplify most of
the everyday objects. We measured the resistance before and after the substrate is coated onto the geometry. In
Proc. ACM Interact. Mob. Wearable Ubiquitous Technol., Vol. 4, No. 1, Article 6. Publication date: March 2020.
6:10 • Cheng and Narumi, et al.
general, we found the resistance increases after transfer, due to the local stretching of the substrates. The flex
geometry caused the resistance to increase from 0.37 to 1.22 Ω/sq, corner from 0.37 to 4.04 Ω/sq, and twist from
0.37 to 6.54 Ω/sq. As we can see, the twisty shape shows a much larger resistance change than the other two. We
speculate when under twisting, the transferred silver traces were subjected to multiple local stretches along with
the twist, which could reduce the density of silver nanoparticles, and increased the resistance.
4.6 Bending Tests
From the geometry test, we found mechanical status especially bending is a strong factor on the resistance
variance of the transferred traces by using our method. Here we investigated bending – both inward and outward
bending. We measured resistance at different bending angles and Figure 7 (b,c) summarize our results. In the
case of outward bending, the sheet resistance decreases as the bending radius is increased, since along with the
increase of the bending radius, the less propagation of cracks will happen with silver traces. For the inward
bending tests, the sheet resistance gets higher as we increase the bending radius. This is because the density of
silver decreases at the bent region. Based on this result, we recommend inward bending for more consistent and
reliable electrical connections.
Fig. 7. (a) Transfer resolution. (b) Resistance under outward bending. (c) Resistance under inward bending.
5 APPLICATIONS
Based on the results from previous evaluations, we developed six application examples applying our technique.
These applications present different key features of prototyping processes, including sensing and actuating,
single- and multi-layer circuitry, domain-specific usage and daily usage in varied scales.
5.1 LED Decorations
We built a large LED display (100 cm by 30 cm) to demonstrate how Silver Tape can provide a fast and easy
routine for fabricating a large conductive pattern (Figure 9a). We inkjet-printed seven Christmas tree patterns
on different A4-sized Mitsubishi PET films and transferred them onto one big PDMS sheet, where the PDMS
sheet is cured on top of an acrylic board backing in a ratio of base to cure 20:1 (Dow Coring Sylgard 184) under
room temperature. Note that the size of this demo is beyond what a standard desktop printer can print. However,
the modular nature of this technique allows us to print and transfer part by part, eliminating the need for large

later on with Cemedine SXECA48 conductive paste. Daytime and nighttime views of the LED circuit are shown
in Figure 9 a2 and 9 a3.

5.2 Bending Sensors for Soft-bodied Robots
Attaching sensors to close the loop in controlling soft-bodied robots is challenging due to the non-compatibility
of traditional sensors with soft-bodied materials. This application shows that Silver Tape can be a promising
method as it easily enables loading soft-bodied robots with sensors without any additional layers. Our soft robot
has been 3D printed by Objet260 Connex3 with soft 3D printing material TangoBlack +, which is quite sticky
and made it a good substrate for Silver Tape (Figure 9b). We transferred a resistance-based bending sensor to a
3D printed inching worm robot and actuated the robot with a shape memory alloy (SMA). The bending motion
of the robot changes the resistance of the bending sensor. We used an Arduino board with a voltage divider to
read the resistance change which was calibrated using the Kinovea motion analyzer to map the corresponding
bending angle. Similarly, this bending sensor can also be applied to on-body locations for posture sensing.
5.3 Circuitry for High-Temperature Applications
Conventional inkjet-printed paper circuits could not endure heat over 120◦C, which limits prior work from
applications on hot surfaces. This example application shows an attachable temperature sensor to a frying pan
(Figure 9c). We printed the conductive pattern on Mitsubishi PET film and transferred to Kapton tape (Lifework
Concierge LCA110, heat tolerant up to 250◦C) to wire up a tiny platinum resistance thermometer (RS Pro PT100)
on both ends of the two silver traces. The resistance change of the sensor, caused by temperature changes, was
measured by an Arduino.
5.4 Touch Panel Extensions for Mobile Devices
We made a striped pattern based touch panel extension, which was printed on Mitsubishi PET film and transferred
to Scotch heavy-duty tape. The touch input is generated when fingers are in contact with the printed conductive
lines. The whole panel extension patch can be fully folded and attached to the back of the phone when not in
use. A user can perform quick commands on the extended touch panel without blocking the phone screen. For
example, Figure 9 d2 and d3 demonstrate a zoom-in gesture.
5.5 Water Leakage Sensor
Figure 9e shows a water leakage sensor, which we made by printing and transferring a spiral pattern onto the
3M 5414 water soluble tape. Leaked water dissolves the substrate and the conductive patterns, which can be
detected by measuring the resistance change with an Arduino. We threshold the resistance measurement for
detection. Figure 9 e1 shows the moment when water leaks from the pipe and dissolves the spiral pattern which
was detected and shown on the computer screen in Figure 9 e3.
5.6 Wirelessly Powered Resonator by Multi-layer Circuit
We demonstrate a design of multi-layer circuit by transferring a silver coil pattern on the top/bottom side of the
PDMS substrates and connecting them with silver conductive epoxy via holes. Figure 9f demonstrates wireless
power transfers to the fabricated coil. AC power (i.e., 6.78 MHz) was emitted from an external power source via a
transmitter coil. The emitted energy was then inductively coupled to the fabricated coil and transferred to an
LED via this inductive link.
6 WORKSHOP AND FINDINGS
In order to investigate the ease of using our technique, we conducted a workshop with seven students (4 females
and 3 males). Among our participants, 3 were from engineering background, and the other 4 participants were
from design background. They all had experience with prototyping interactive systems except one participant.

None of our participants had printed silver ink with inkjet printers before. Our hypothesis is that participants
could replicate our transfer technique with minimum effort.
Fig. 10. Workshop Results: Participants completing fabrication steps from transferring the mouse pattern to PDMS sheet,
mounting the LED with conductive Epoxy, and lighting it up with DC power supply.
6.1 Procedure
We conducted a workshop in a studio-like lab space and followed a 3-hour timeline with three sessions: (1) a 15
minute introduction session, (2) a design and prototyping session for 2.5 hours, and (3) a discussion and survey
session for 15 minutes. The workshop started with the introduction of Silver Tape, our study scope, related
works and application examples described in the previous section and we demonstrated the fabrication process
of Silver Tape. Then we provided a variety of materials including adhesives (i.e., Scotch double-sided tape, Scotch
transparent tape, Scotch heavy duty tape, Capton tape, water soluble tape, PDMS sheets and etc), connection
materials (i.e., silver conductive epoxy, Bare paint, copper wire), and tools (i.e., DC power supply, multi-meter,
scissors etc) and proposed a task for the design session. Participants were asked to complete a simple LED circuit
(Figure. 10 a) within 20 minutes. The pattern was designed by us before the workshop, and participants were
asked to complete the fabrication steps: (1) print the mouse pattern on paper (Fujifilm Paper Kassai Pro was
used), (2) transfer the mouse pattern onto tape (PDMS sheets were used), (3) mount the LED with silver epoxy
glue, and by the end, power the circuitry with DC power supply. This task was designed to validate the ease
of use of our technique. Participants were given a 2-hour design session to complete the tasks and create more
complex designs with any time spared. At the end of the workshop, participants had a group discussion and
finished a questionnaire to summarize their experience of using Silver Tape.
6.2 Results
All participants completed the replication task within 20 minutes. We observed that everyone had no trouble
throughout the printing and transferring processes, while two of them encountered minor technical issues during
the mounting step: one participant (P2) first mounted a LED to the wrong part of the transferred traces, and
another participant (P4) applied too much silver epoxy and caused short circuits. These two participants took a
second trail to finish the circuit. The other five participants successfully completed building the circuit with their
first trials using Silver Tape.
6.3 Evaluation and Reflection
Based on our observations, results from the questionnaires, and the discussion with participants during the
workshop, we derived several design implications in terms of the ease of use and accessibility of our fabrication
technique along with the transfer quality of the printed patterns.

6.3.1 Ease of Use. The participants responded positively to this transferal-based inkjet printing technique. We
verified that all participants learned Silver Tape techniques and completed the tasks of the simple circuitry
within one hour. Participants could easily follow the printing and transferal procedures without any difficulties.
Additionally, in a rating scale of "absolutely easy; easy; neutral; hard; absolutely hard", 3 participants rated our
technique as absolutely easy, 3 other participants as easy, and one participant as neutral. This result confirmed
our hypothesis that Silver Tape is easy to replicate, which means users can adopt our technique without any
special training.
6.3.2 Transfer Quality. In this project, transfer quality plays an essential role in fabricating electronics. Based
on the deliverables of the task ( 7(𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑠) × 1(𝑃𝐷𝑀𝑆 𝑎𝑑ℎ𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑣𝑒) + 1(𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑡) × (𝑃𝐷𝑀𝑆 𝑎𝑑ℎ𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑣𝑒) +

remained sound and stable across all deliverables. We consider this result to be compelling, especially given
that participants rubbed the printed traces onto the adhesives in various ways, with different peeling speeds,
directions, and forces.
7 DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS
7.1 Stretchabilities
As mentioned previously in this paper, due to the limitation from the material itself, silver nanoparticle traces are
barely stretchable. However, stretchability plays an irreplaceable role in many applications such as wearable
devices. We expect that prestretching the PDMS substrate before transfer can be a method to increase the
stretchability of Silver Tape, without losing the benefits (i.e., simplicity) of our method.
7.2 On Skin Transfer
As for the silver transfer on skin, only a short length (1 cm) of the conductive trace was successfully transferred
so far in our pilot test, mainly due to the wrinkles on the skin surface, which might cause the cracks on the
transferred traces. However, we regard directly transferring silver onto our skin as a possible future research
direction, like tattoo paper-based methods described in [9, 20].
7.3 Robustness
There are two aspects to consider: the robustness of the transfer step and the longevity of the transferred traces.
For the first one, similar to what have been discussed in the transfer quality section, the transferred pattern quality
has been barely affected when different participants were conducting the transfer step with different peeling
direction, force, speed, or even geometries. However, the transferred pattern could be fragile. Two participants
also raised a concern about the fragility in the questionnaire. This is mainly due to the brittle nature of the silver
nanoparticles. Any accidental scratches or over bending would cause the permanent breakage of the transferred
pattern. Laminating a cover layer like [13] or simply applying another tape layer on top of the transferred circuitry
could potentially prevent the circuit breakage.
7.4 Hysteresis of Silver Nanoparticles
We observed the hysteresis of the transferred silver nanoparticle traces when conducting experiments, where the
resistance will take sometime to recover or settle to a stable value. Inspired by the work [31] of rubbing liquid
metal particles (EGaIn) into the printed silver nanoparticles, we might be able to minimize the hysteresis effect of
the silver nanoparticles.
For the future research directions, fabricating large scale electronics with multi-functionalities is in high
priority. This work provided a solution for large scale electronic fabrication, but still many manual steps are

involved. We would like to explore more automated systems which could provide an end-to-end solution for
users by not only designing and printing the conductive traces, but also auto-mounting the electronics. For
example, robotic arms or remote-controlled robots equipped with a conductive dipping machine might be worth
investigating. Another research direction would be how to apply the conductive patterns and electronics onto
conformal surfaces robustly without losing the rapid and easy nature. We believe the transfer technique has a
promising potential to solve this. Instead of transferring non-stretchable silver nanoparticles, one could transfer
stretchable conductive material such as carbon grease, PEDOT:PSS, with the help of a deformable transfer media
like foam. We believe both directions are worth exploring for further investigation in order to reach the goal of
rapid digital fabrication of electronics.
8 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented Silver Tape, a simple yet novel fabrication technique to achieve both rapid prototyping capability derived from inkjet-printed paper circuits and multi-functional property derived from different
substrates at the same time. By utilizing a less sticky paper substrate as a temporary transfer film, we can peel
off and transfer inkjet-printed, sintering-free silver traces to multiple sticky substrates without pre- or postprocesses. We also demonstrated the ease of use nature of our approach with a workshop study. We hope our
technique can support and inspire various types of makers from children to professional researchers to enlarge
the design space of digital circuit fabrication.
