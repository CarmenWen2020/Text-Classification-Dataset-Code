Abstract
The cut-and-project method may be applied to graphs and complexes, although there are technical difficulties, most notably “collisions,” i.e. when the images (under the projection) of two disjoint edges or cells intersect. Given a particular periodic structure, a particular projection space, an appropriate “window” in the orthogonal complement of that space, the induced substructure within the cartesian product of the window and the projection space is projected to the projection space to produce a “model structure.” We may use an index space of vectors from the orthogonal complement to move the window around and obtain a “model system” of model structures. We adapt the notion of “general position” to higher dimensions: the projection space is in “doubly general position” with respect to a graph or complex when the projection of that structure maps vertices of that structure injectively into the projection space and the edges or polytopes of that structure injectively so that their dimension is not reduced and disjoint edges and polytopes remain disjoint. We find that if the initial structure was a periodic graph, if the projection space and its complement are in general position with respect to the vertices and edges, and the window is also in general position, then the model system has uncountably many isomorphism classes - with distinct coordination sequences.

1. Introduction
A third of a century ago, Dan Shechtman et al. [1] reported the existence of a material whose “diffraction spots are as sharp as those of crystals” but whose symmetries are “inconsistent with lattice translations.” Since then, the nanoscale structure of these “quasicrystals” have been a major desideratum of theoretical crystallography, and a popular cluster of methods for generating quasicrystals goes back to [2] and [3], in which a “slice” of a higher dimensional periodic structure is projected to a lower dimensional space. There have been a number of such approaches (e.g. [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]), but most have been of point sets or the tilings derived from them. And [11] (also see [12]) verified that such constructions did produce point sets whose diffraction patterns consisted of discrete points. These have been called cut-and-project tilings and model sets; see [13] or [14].

There have been hints that such methods may be applicable to graphs ([15] and [16]), but graphs do not seem to have been subjected to much cutting-and-projecting. However, [17] presented some largely theoretical arguments supporting graphs as a model for crystals or quasicrystals (an argument most dramatically supported by inter-penetrating periodic graphs, such as those described in [18], and derived graphs from the tilings of [19]). And as a practical matter, graphs may be more realistic models for representing the nanoscale structure of covalent crystals, quasicrystals, and similar structures.

While representations of material structures as graphs goes back to the nineteenth century, crystal design started in the later twentieth century (see, e.g. [20]), especially with the cataloging work of [21] and [22] (see [23] and [24]), which led to the “reticular chemistry” program laid out in [25]. In particular, graphs have been used to represent a range of materials, from DNA crystals [26] to metal-organic frameworks [27]. However, recalling that tilings may be viewed as complexes (of a sort), and observing that many illustrations of crystal structures are actually illustrations of complexes (see, e.g., the RCSR database [28]), and there are many references to polygonal or polyhedral molecular units in the literature, so representation of materials by complexes may not be unreasonable. In this article, we develop model graphs and model complexes from periodic (and non-periodic) structures.

The classical cut-and-project method is as follows. If we take a single periodic pointset Γ in d-dimensional space, and a single projection space  incommensurable with the lattice group of Γ, then the restriction of Γ to  for an appropriate “window” 
, projected to , will produce a “model” pointset 
. We can obtain many pointsets by translating W within 's orthogonal complement 
, and it follows from [29], [11], or [30] that all these structures look the same in the sense that they share the same bounded pointsets modulo translation, but they typically form a family of uncountably many isometrically distinct pointsets. For example, [31] considers tilings obtained by cut-and-project of a lattice , whose window W is a projection of a Voronoi cell of a lattice point, and finds that if 
 is incommensurable with the lattice, and if a window 
 is a translation of W by a vector that is not in the projection of  to 
, then resulting tilings are not isomorphic (similar results were obtained in [17] and [19]).

If we sought similar results for graphs, we might observe that among the cataloging criteria for graph representations of materials is graph isomorphism [32]. We might expect that by moving the window around, we may obtain many distinct isomorphism classes of model graphs. To confirm this, we use a graph invariant, the “coordination sequence.” Given a particular vertex v, we obtain a sequence 
, where 
 is the number of vertices of edge-distance 
 from v. [33] popularized coordination sequences, not only for indexing databases of crystals such as RCSR and ToposPro [34], but also for obtaining information on the topology of the corresponding crystal structure.

Using [35], [36] and [37] derived coordination sequences from root lattices; [38] developed generating functions for sequences for some periodic graphs, and [35] developed an algebraic system for doing so. [39] derived coordination sequences and their generating functions for some root systems, and they say that they were following up on [36]. Coordination sequences for periodic graphs seemed very well-behaved, and [38] conjectured and [40] proved the following conjecture. Call a function  quasi-polynomial if there exist polynomials 
 and an integer N such that for each , 
. The conjectured and subsequently proven result was that for any periodic graph, and any vertex in that periodic graph, the coordination sequence for that vertex is enumerated by a quasi-polynomial function. Our main result is that this is untrue for certain classes of model graphs of dimension at least 3, for while there are only countably many quasi-polynomial functions from 
 to 
, we will see that for any periodic graph of dimension at least 4 and any appropriate projection space of dimension at least 3 and convex window, there are uncountably many coordination sequences among those vertices. (This means that almost all of these coordination sequences are not computable - and, in fact, almost all of them cannot be specified by any finite symbolic expression, for there are only countably many finite symbolic expressions from any finite alphabet.) See [41] for references on coordination sequences.

After § 2, where we formalize our terms, in § 3, we present a method for cutting and projecting complexes and graphs, address some of the technical issues, and make some basic observations that will prove useful later. In § 4, we outline some of the basics about coordination sequences of graphs, and then prove that from a single periodic graph, an appropriately chosen projection space and window, we can obtain uncountably many mutually non-isomorphic model graphs with distinct coordination sequences. Thus the current approach to classifying quasiperiodic tilings - grouping them into closely allied families of tilings rather than into isomorphism classes (as is done with periodic structures) - appears to be a more feasible approach for classifying quasiperiodic graphs and complexes.

Here is some basic nomenclature we will use.

2. About graphs (and complexes)
There is a menagerie of definitions of complexes and graph in the literature. Since we seek to integrate the nomenclatures of complexes and graphs, some of our definitions will be a bit nonstandard.

2.1. Complexes
Donald Coxeter once characterized geometry as “the study of figures and figures,” and so we start with geometric figures. We generalize the adopt the definition from [42].

Definition 2.1

Fix a real vector space 
. A half-space is a solution set 
 for fixed 
 and . A convex polytope in 
 is a bounded non-empty intersection of finitely many half-spaces of 
.

All polytopes in this article will be convex.

Notice that a polytope in 
 must be of dimension at most d, but that dimension could be lower. For example, in 
, the intersection of the half-spaces defined by the inequalities , , , , ,  is the square disk  lying on the xy-plane. More generally, a polytope P in 
 of dimension k lies in a flat  in 
 of dimension k. Notice that a convex polytope is closed.

If a polytope P in 
 of dimension k lies in a flat in 
 of dimension k, then relative to that flat, P has a boundary. For example, returning to our square 
, the disk's flat is the xy-plane, and relative to that flat, the boundary of the disk is the square 
, which is composed of the four sides 
, 
, 
, and 
. We call these four sides the facets of the square disk. We generalize this notion; notice that a half-space H defined by an inequality  has a boundary .

Definition 2.2

Fix a real vector space 
 and for some , fix a k-dimensional flat  in 
. Let P be a k-dimensional convex polytope in  that is the intersection of the half-spaces 
. Suppose that 
 is minimal in the sense that an intersection of any proper subset of these half-spaces is not P. Then we define a facet of P to be an intersection 
, .

Notice that the union of the facets of P is the boundary of P, and notice that if P is a k-dimensional polytope in a k-dimensional flat , then each of the facets is itself a -dimensional polytope in a -dimensional flat in , with its own facets, which are -dimensional polytopes, and so on down.

Conversely, if we started by calling the points of  0-polytopes, and the finite line segments in  the 1-polytopes, the facets of a 1-polytope would be its endpoints, which would be 0-polytopes; we would call these endpoints faces of the line segment, and the line segment itself would be the cell of the line segment. Then a convex polygonal disk in  would be a 2-polytope whose facets would its sides, and their facets would be their endpoints, i.e. the corners of the disk; the sides and corners would be the faces of the disk while the disk itself is the cell of the disk. We would continue in this fashion: given a convex polyhedron, its facets, edges, and corners would be its faces and its interior would be its cell. We generalize this as follows, again following [42].

Definition 2.3

Let P be a k-dimensional convex polytope in a k-dimensional flat  in 
, . The faces of P are obtained by the following recursion. If 
 are the facets of P, then if 
 are the sets of faces of 
, respectively, then the faces of P is the union 
. The face lattice of P is the partial ordering of the faces of P, ordered by inclusion.

Typically, the empty set ∅ is considered to be a face. Notice that a face of a convex polytope is itself convex (the situation gets a little more complex when the polytopes are not convex; we do not address that situation in this article).

For example, consider Fig. 1, the polyhedron that is the intersection of the half-spaces , , , , and . It has one cell, five facets, nine edges, and six corners, and hence 21 faces.

Fig. 1. At left is a pentahedron and at right a diagram of its face lattice (such a diagram is called a Hasse diagram). Faces are indicated by the vertices that they contain.

Call the 0-dimensional faces of a polytope its vertices.

If two faces of a polytope are of the same dimension k and share a facet, we say that they are adjacent. If they share an element in their face lattices but are not adjacent, we say that they are incident; otherwise, say that they are disjoint.

We can join two polytopes the same way: two polytopes are adjacent if their intersection is a shared facet; they are incident if their intersection is a shared face. By joining polytopes (embedded in the same space, but not necessarily of the same dimension), we obtain complexes. A complex is composed of polytopes; notice that the definition excludes complexes with self-intersecting components and recall that a set 
 is uniformly discrete if there exists  such that

Definition 2.4

Two polytopes 
 and 
 of face lattices 
 and 
, respectively, are called compatible if 
. A complex is defined to be a set Γ of pairwise compatible polytopes such that:

•
If , then P's face lattice satisfies .

•
If 
 and 
, then 
.

•
The set of vertices of the complex is the set of all vertices occurring in the polytopes of which it is composed, and the set of vertices is uniformly discrete.

A complex is called connected if, for any 
, there exist 
 such that 
, 
, and for each , 
.
Example 2.5

If our complex was a tiling, the tiles would have to intersect at shared faces (i.e. be face-to-face tilings, as in [43, p. 128]), which limits the kinds of tilings we could consider: see Fig. 3.

Fig. 3. If the tiling consisted of unit squares, four facets (sides) each, with one of them in place, the only tiling we could construct (consistent with our definitions) would be the one at left, for the tiling at right would have abutting squares that do not share faces.

We will need the following:

Definition 2.6

Let Γ be a complex and 
 its set of vertices. Given a subset 
, the subcomplex induced by S is the complex . If 
, let 
.

2.2. Graphs
A graph is usually presented as an ordered pair , where V is the set of its vertices while E is its set of edges. However, we wish to treat graphs as complexes.

Definition 2.7

We define a graph to be a complex whose cells are each of dimension at most 1. The 1-dimensional faces are its edges and its 0-dimensional faces are its vertices. We say that two vertices are adjacent if they share an edge and two edges are adjacent if they share a vertex. If a vertex is an element of an edge, we say that they are incident.

Thus a graph Γ is just a set of 0- and 1-dimensional faces. Nevertheless, to articulate with the rest of the graph-theoretic literature, given a graph Γ, we will denote its set of vertices by 
 and its set of edges by 
. But here 
. For example, recalling that the line segment from x to y is , to interpret the graph  as a combinatorial object, we say that 
 is its set of vertices and 
, , ,  is its set of edges, where the edge  has endpoints  and  while the edge  has endpoints  and .

Since the vertices of a graph are points in a real vector space, we will denote vertices by lower case boldface.

Remark 2.8

The usual procedure is to define graphs as combinatorial (or even topological) objects, and then embed them in some kind of space. The embedded graph is called a realization of the original graph, and is called a geometric or spacial graph; if the space the graph is embedded in is Euclidean, it may be called a Euclidean graph. In this paper, all graphs are Euclidean.

We presume that readers are familiar with graphs, but we will be relying on the following nomenclature.

•
For any vertex v, let  be the set of edges incident to v, and the neighborhood of v is the set  of vertices adjacent to v. Similarly, for any edge e,  is the set of e's endpoints.

•
For any vertex v, the coordination1 of v is the number of edges incident to that vertex.

•
Given two vertices u and v, a path from u to v is a sequence 
, 
 where 
 and 
 and for each , 
 and 
 share the vertex 
. We say that this path is of edge-length (or length) n. The edge-distance from u to v is the length of the shortest path from u to v, and if u and v are vertices of a graph Γ, 
 is the edge-distance from u to v. The graph is connected if, for any pair of vertices, there is a path from one to the other.

•
The coordination sequence of a vertex v in a graph Γ is the function 
 mapping each positive integer to the number of vertices of edge distance k from v.

•
Definition 2.6 applies to graphs: given a graph Γ and a subset 
, the subgraph induced by S is the graph 
. If Γ is a graph in 
 and 
, let 
.

•
An isomorphism from a graph 
 onto a graph 
 is a bijection 
 mapping edges to edges and vertices and such that for each 
, . If there is an isomorphism from one graph to another, we call them isomorphic.

•
Given a isomorphism 
 and given an induced subgraph  of 
, the pre-image of Δ under f is the graph 
; notice that it is an induced subgraph of 
.

Definition 2.9

Call a graph Γ finitary if there exists a finite set of line segments such that for each edge of Γ, there is a translation mapping one of those line segments onto that edge.

Observe that if a graph is finitary, then it has only a finite number of vectors that can occur going from vertex to neighboring vertex, and hence it is of bounded coordination. A “building block” in [44, p. 95] is a set of vectors giving the shape vertex figure about a vertex.

Definition 2.10

Given a graph Γ and a vertex 
, we define the building block of v to be the set . The set of building blocks of Γ is .

For example, consider the graph fes (as denoted in [22]) and depicted in Fig. 4. The graph fes has four building blocks, also drawn in that figure, each with a vertical vector, a horizontal vector, and a diagonal vector.

Fig. 4. At left, a graph representation of fes, with eight of the vertex positions are labeled; notice that the edge-lengths are all 1 or . At right, the four building blocks of fes, clockwise from the upper left: {〈 − 1,1〉,〈1,0〉,〈0,−1〉}, and at upper right {〈 − 1,0〉,〈1,1〉,〈0,−1〉}, and at lower right {〈0,1〉,〈1,−1〉,〈 − 1,0〉}, and at lower left {〈0,1〉,〈1,0〉,〈 − 1,−1〉}.

We will have little to say about symmetries in this article, but call a complex in 
 periodic if there exists a basis 
 of 
 such that for each i, the translation 
 is a symmetry of the complex.

3. Cut-and-project
Recall that given a complex Γ in 
 and 
, the subcomplex of Γ restricted to S is .

Definition 3.1

Let Γ be a complex on 
, let 
, and let 
 be bounded. We define the model complex for the projection space  and window W to be as follows.

1.
Let  be the complex consisting of those faces wholly within .

2.
Letting π be the perpendicular projection of 
 onto , let .

If 
, let 
 be a linear isometry (so that ), and let 
 be the image of  under ι.
In the literature, these might also be called “section complexes” or “cut-and-project complexes,” but “model complex” sounds the least clunky. Also, in the literature, windows are compact and convex, and projections of Γ's lattice do not intersect the boundary of the window. In this article, projections of faces may intersect boundaries of windows, so we merely require that windows be convex - and usually open, although sometimes they will be closed and sometimes neither.

We choose a two-dimensional subspace and its one-dimensional orthogonal complement. The window will be an open interval in the complement of the subspace, and the two planes are the sets of points of 
 mapped to the endpoints of the window, as in Fig. 7.

Fig. 7

Fig. 7. The region between the two planes is , where W is the window, a subset of the orthogonal space (the

Image 1
) and  is the projection space (parallel to the two planes). (For interpretation of the colors in the figure(s), the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
Notice that the window could be placed anywhere in the orthogonal complement, a consideration that leads to the following definition. Notice that we started with a three-dimensional vertex transitive graph, so that each vertex had the same vertex figure. Moreover, there were only two building blocks in the original graph. But in the model graph, since vertices in the slice lost some of their edges, those vertices (and hence the ultimate model graph) had coordinations 2 or 3. Moreover, since the shape of the vertex figure changed when projected, there was a different collection of building blocks.

The following is implicit in, and explicitly used, in [31].

Definition 3.2

Let Γ be a complex in 
 and let 
. Let 
. We define the model system 
 to be the ensemble of model complexes 
, each obtained by isolating and projecting the subpattern  to , for each 
.

3.1. Avoiding collisions
In the cut-and-project literature, when constructing model sets from point sets, one chooses a projection that maps the point set injectively to the projection space. We will need an additional restriction, and we have the additional desideratum that we want each intersection of projections of faces to be the projection of the intersection of those faces (recall that the intersection of two faces of a complex is a face) and thus, for graphs, the projections of two disjoint edges do not intersect.

Recall that if 
, then  is the affine flat generated by S, and observe that if , then  is the vector subspace generated from S. We seek to avoid “collisions,” a collision being when the intersection of two distinct faces is not projected onto the intersection of the projections of those faces (e.g. when the projections of two disjoint faces intersect). For example, consider Fig. 6 above. If the two planes in Fig. 8 had been far enough apart, the resulting sliced subgraph would have had homeomorphic2 copies of the complete bipartite graph 
 in it as well as homeomorphic copies of the complete 5-clique. This sliced subgraph would thus not be planar, and when projected onto a plane, would have “collisions” when edges crossed edges. This is the situation we seek to avoid.

Definition 3.3

Suppose that we are given a complex Γ on 
 with vertex set V, and a subspace 
, and let 
 and 
 be the orthogonal projections. Then  is in general position with respect to V if π and 
 are injective on V. Given a set 
, say that S is in general position with respect to V if, for any 
, 
.

For example, suppose that Γ was the graph in 
 whose vertices were 
 and whose edges were the line segments  and , , thus forming a grid on the xy-plane. (This is the “layer” sql [22].) If  is any 2-dimensional non-vertical and non-horizontal subspace of 
, then Γ is in general position with respect to 
. And if so, 
 is in general position with respect to V provided there are no  such that 
.

This suffices to avoid vertex collisions, but face collisions are another matter. In fact, notice that if we are cut-and-projecting a graph in 
, , to a two-dimensional subspace, we may well expect edge collisions as otherwise the resulting model graph is planar. However, if we are cut-and-projecting a graph in 
, , to a three-dimensional subspace, we may be able to orient the projection space so as to avoid edge collisions. Let us take a closer look.

Recall that if S is a bounded set, then we say that the dimension of S is the least dimension of any flat containing S. (For example, recall our square disk  lying on the xy-plane in 
. The flat containing this disk is the xy-plane, and thus the square is two-dimensional.)

Now for a pair of reminders. A half-space of 
 is the solution space of an inequality  for some 
 and . Recall that the convex hull of a set of points in 
 is the intersection of all half-spaces containing that set of points; recall that we denote the convex hull of a pointset S by . For example, the convex hull of  is our old friend, the square disk , whose flat is 
. On the other hand, the convex hull of the line segments  and  is the tetrahedron whose corners are , , , and , and the flat containing it is just 
.

Definition 3.4

Given bounded sets P and Q in 
, we define the collision set of P and Q to be .

Notice that if 
 and 
, then 
, these bounds being sharp.

Definition 3.5

Let Γ be a complex. We say that a subspace  is in general position with respect to Γ if, for each pair of polytopes , 
.

Returning to our example of sql that followed Definition 3.3, the edges of sql are the line segments  and , and for any two such edges, their convex hull is a quadrilateral lying on the xy-plane, and the subspace containing that convex hull is the xy-plane. As all two-dimensional subspaces (i.e. planes containing the origin) intersect the xy-plane nontrivially, there are no two-dimensional subspaces in general position with respect to sql. However, a one-dimensional subspace is in general position with respect to sql if and only if it is not horizontal.

We apply this to cutting and projecting.

Definition 3.6

Given a complex Γ and a subspace  with orthogonal projection 
, we define the following.

•
If  are polytopes such that , say that P and Q collide and that π admits a collision of Γ.

•
If , say that π collapses P and that π admits a collapse of Γ.

Recall our discussion of sql after Definition 3.3, Definition 3.5. An orthogonal projection of sql onto a plane would have to be to a plane that is not perpendicular, i.e. the plane is in general position with respect to the edges of sql (i.e. it is not perpendicular) and its normal line is in general position with respect to its vertices (i.e. it is not horizontal). We generalize this observation.

Proposition 3.7

Given a complex Γ on 
 and a subspace 
 with orthogonal projection 
, π admits a collision or a collapse of Γ if and only if 
 is not in general position with respect to Γ.

Proof

Let  and notice that . First, if P and Q collide, then there exist ﹨ and  (or  and ﹨) such that , or  even though . Letting 
 be the orthogonal projection, as 
, we have 
, so that 
, and 
 is not in general position with respect to Γ. Similarly, if π collapses P, then for some distinct , , so 
.

On the other hand, if 
, then there exist distinct  such that 
 so that 
, and thus that . There are two cases.

If  and , then we can choose 
 so that 
, so that 
 spans , which is thus of lower dimension, and thus π collapses P. The subcase , is similar.

If ﹨ and  with 
, then , and P and Q collide, so π admits a collision of Γ. The subcase  and ﹨ is similar. □

As an example, we construct a model graph in 
 with no collisions by cutting and projecting a slice from a periodic graph in 
. Our graph Γ is the hypercubic grid of vertex set 
 and edge set
 Then the convex hull of any two edges is either a triangle (if the two edges share a vertex) or a quadrilateral (if they don't share a vertex but lie on the same plane) or a tetrahedron. We will see in the next section that we would expect a randomly selected 3-dimensional projection space to be in general position with respect to 
, and its perpendicular complement to be in general position with respect to Γ. But for the moment, we construct a concrete example.

Let 
, 
,... be the standard basis.

•
If the edges are 
 and 
 for some 
 and some , the collision space is 
. This is a plane (assuming edges are distinct and thus ).

•
If the edges are 
 and 
 for some 
 and some , , the collision space is 
. This is a plane if , and a 3-dimensional subspace otherwise.

Let 
 
 and let 
, and
 
 
 
 notice that we have chosen unit vectors for our bases of these two subspaces. We claim that  is in general position with respect to 
 and that 
 is in general position with respect to Γ.

First,  is in general position with respect to 
. Recall from vector calculus that if we projected 
 onto 
 
, , the resulting vector would be 
 for some . So if x and y have the same perpendicular projection to , then for that i,
 
 
 so that
 
 
 
 
 As  and p and q are prime, if  is the field of rationals, the intersection of the extension fields  and  is , so 
 and 
. Repeating for all three basis vectors of  and letting π be the perpendicular projection onto , if , then .

Second, 
 is in general position with respect to Γ. Choose a collision space 
 or 
 with 
 and  and . W.l.o.g., let  be the collision space consisting of all vectors 
, and let ﹨; equating the kth and ℓth coordinates of 
 and , we obtain 
 and 
, where p and q are distinct primes. Then 
, and either  or 
. If , the collision space intersects 
 at 0. If 
, then the two edges lie on an coaxial plane or they both lie on a line with an integer tangent vector. If on a coaxial plane, that is their collision space, which is a vector space that intersects 
 at the origin. If on a line with an integer tangent vector, that vector is not parallel to e, so the vector subspace corresponding to the line intersects 
 at 0.

If we took Γ and any interval 
 and projected the subgraph  onto , there would be no edge collisions. Of course, if W was a bit wide, the edges in the projection of the subgraph would be tightly packed, and some of them would get quite close.

3.2. When almost all projection spaces are in general position
The requirement for a projection space to be in general position is not too bad, and in fact, we claim that under certain conditions, almost all projection spaces are in general position, in the following sense.

Definition 3.8

Let  be a property of 
-dimensional subspaces of 
 where 
. Say that almost all 
-dimensional subspaces of 
 have property  if the following is true.

Let 
 be the -sphere in 
 and let μ be the uniform probability measure on 
. If we selected a 
-dimensional space by randomly selecting 
 vectors from 
 uniformly and independently via μ, then with probability 1, the 
 selected vectors generate a subspace with property .

We now claim that if  is the property of being in general position, then under conditions enumerated below, almost all projection spaces are in general position.

Proposition 3.9

Let 
 and 
. Suppose that Γ is a complex whose faces are of dimension at most k in 
. If 
 then almost every 
-dimensional subspace 
 has 
 in general position with respect to Γ.

And as 
 is countable, almost every subspace  of dimension 
 is in general position with respect to 
. We need the following bit of lore.

Lemma 3.10

Let 
 be a finite or countable set of k-dimensional subspaces of 
, where . Almost every 
⁎
-dimensional subspace intersects each subspace of 
 trivially if and only if 
⁎
.

For the convenience of the reader, we include a proof.

Proof

First, we prove by induction on 
⁎
 that if 
⁎
 then almost every 
⁎
-dimensional subspace intersects each subspace in 
 trivially. This is true for 
⁎
 because if 
⁎
 was the union of the (countably many) subspaces in 
, then the measure of 
⁎
 is 0. Suppose that the proposition is true for all 
⁎
, where 
⁎
; We prove the proposition for 
⁎
 as follows.

We randomly select a 
⁎
-dimensional subspace by randomly selecting the first  elements of its basis, and then the last element, as follows. Randomly and independently select 
⁎
; observe that by induction, with probability 1, , 
, …, 
⁎
 =  for each 
. Let 
 be the set of 
⁎
-dimensional subspaces 
⁎
. Then randomly select 
⁎
 independently of its predecessors, and as 
⁎
 with probability 1, 
⁎
⁎
 for any 
⁎
.

Now, if 
⁎
⁎
 for some 
, then for some 
⁎
, ﹨ and ﹨, 
⁎
, or 
⁎
⁎
. This contradiction gives us 
⁎
⁎
 for all 
.

Finally, we observe that if 
⁎
, any 
⁎
-dimensional subspace must intersect any k-dimensional subspace in a subspace of dimension at least 
⁎
. □

Proof of Proposition 3.9

As the convex hulls of the collision spaces are of dimension at most , a randomly selected 
 of dimension 
 will avoid all of them with probability 1 if 
, i.e. 
. □

We want both the projection space and its orthogonal complement to be in general position. Recall the notions of “general position” defined in Definition 3.3, Definition 3.5.

Definition 3.11

Given a complex Γ on 
, we say that a subspace  is in doubly general position with respect to Γ if  is in general position with respect to 
 and 
 is in general position with respect to Γ.

Thus the example following Proposition 3.7 had a projection space in doubly general position with respect to a graph. In particular, given a periodic graph Γ spanning 
, , almost every 3-dimensional subspace  is in doubly general position with respect to Γ. Thus the window could be as large as we like and still we would have no edge collisions. This suggests an algorithm for generating model graphs. Choose a periodic graph Γ in, say, 
; for example, the grid graph of vertices 
 and edges
 The collision set of two disjoint and skew edges  and  will be a tetrahedron in 5-space, and thus generate the three-dimensional flat .

We want to avoid all of these collision sets. One way to do this is to randomly choose a three-dimensional subspace . With probability 1,  will be in doubly general position with respect to Γ. That is to say, for each 
,  and further, for each pair of disjoint edges, the perpendicular projections of them to  will be disjoint. Then any window, no matter how wide, will produce a model graph with no intersecting edges (although if the window is very wide, some edges can come very close).

On the other hand, if, by some mischance, we had chosen 
, then 
, and not only does π fail to map 
 injectively into  (as  and 0 are both mapped to 0) but we have collisions (as  and  are mapped on top of each other) and collapses (as  is collapsed into the origin). But again, this happens with probability 0. There are more serious practical problems.

We often want a model complex of dimension two, or a model complex of dimension three with two- or even three-dimensional faces. And we do not want disjoint to get uncomfortably close: it is common in crystal design circles to regard with suspicion any crystal structure in which two edges are closer together than their own length. Moreover, sometimes we want building blocks that are realized precisely when the projection space is not generic with respect to Γ. Then we have to more judiciously choose a nice window.

Definition 3.12

Given  and 
, say that these are collision-free for Γ if, for every 
, projecting  onto  produces no edge collisions.

3.3. Limits of cut-and-project graphs
We will be taking limits of model graphs, using the displacements as a parameter. Unfortunately, the limit of a sequence of model graphs might not be the model graph of the limit of the window, so we need to be precise about what the limit is.

Definition 3.13

Let Γ be a complex in 
, let 
, and let 
 be open and convex. Let 
 be a convergent sequence in 
, and for each n, let 
. Then define the limits of the sequence 
 as follows.

•
Let  
 
 
.

•
Let 
 
 be the projection of the subcomplex of Γ induced by the set 
.

And if  
 
 
 
, let 
 
 
.
These limits behave roughly as expected.

Proposition 3.14

Let Γ be a complex on 
, let 
 and let 
 be open. Then for every , there exists  such that if , then
 In particular, if 
, then for each R, there exists N such that if , then

Proof

For the first claim, let ε be the minimal distance between 
 and 
. For the second claim, choose N such that 
. □

A bit of nomenclature (which is also implicit in [31]).

Definition 3.15

Let Γ be a complex on 
 and let 
. Let 
 be open and convex, and let 
. We define the window system indexed by I to be the set of windows , and from each of these we denote model complex 
. We say that the model system indexed by I is the ensemble 
.

If I is not specified, we presume that 
. If Γ was a graph, suppose that 
 is a graph with vertex set 
 and edge set 
. Notice that if Γ is periodic with unit cell 
, then for any 
, there exists 
 such that there is an isometric isomorphism from the model graph produced by 
 onto the one produced by 
.

Notice that if 
 is the edge-distance between vertices of Γ along edges in Γ, and if 
 is the edge-distance between vertices of 
 along edges in 
, then for all 
, 
.

We will need the following application.

Definition 3.16

Let Γ be a graph on 
, let 
, let 
, and let 
. We say that the model system 
 bounds distances for , W and I if, for any 
, there exists 
 such that for any , if 
, then 
.

Notice also that for  being the lattice group of a periodic graph Γ, for any  and 
, 
. It follows that for given , U and I if  bounds distances for any two vertices in the same or adjacent unit cells, it bounds distances for the entire graph.

Proposition 3.17

Let Γ be a graph on 
 and let 
 and 
 be open in 
. Let 
 be compact and index the window system  and the model system . Suppose that for every , the model graph 
 is connected, and that for every convergent sequence 
 in I, 
 
 is connected. Then  bounds distances for , W, and I.

Notice that if Γ is periodic, we can choose a unit cell of the symmetry group of Γ, and the closure of the projection of that region into 
 will serve as an index set representing all of 
.

Proof of Proposition 3.17

Let π be the orthogonal projection of 
 onto . Towards contradiction, suppose that there exists 
 and, for each n, there exists 
 such that 
 and 
. Let 
. Let e be the maximal edge-length and thin the sequence 
 so that for each n,
 
 
 per Proposition 3.14. But then, 
 
 has no path from  to , which gives us our contradiction. □

The following notion will be specialized in the next section.

Definition 3.18

Given sets 
 and a subspace 
, say that S is generic with respect to T if, for any 
, .

In a special case, we can go beyond Proposition 3.17.

Proposition 3.19

Let Γ be a graph on 
 of bounded coordination, and let  and 
 be open and bounded. Let 
 be the perpendicular projection of 
 onto 
, and suppose that ∂W is generic with respect to 
 within 
. Suppose that for every , the model graph 
 is connected, and let 
 be the edge distance from x to y along edges in 
. Then  bounds distances for  and W.

Proof

The proof is by contradiction: suppose otherwise, and for each N, choose 
 such that 
 has both x and y as vertices and yet 
. As the degree of Γ is bounded, there exists 
 adjacent to x in Γ such that if 
 then J is infinite. Similarly, there exists 
 adjacent to y in Γ such that if 
, then 
 is infinite.

As W is bounded and x and y are vertices in each 
, the set of 
 is bounded, and so has an accumulation point 
. Call the corresponding model graph 
. There are two cases. If both of x and y are in 
, then by Proposition 3.14, there is no path from x to y in 
, and hence 
 is not connected.

On the other hand, if at least one of x or y fails to be in 
, say 
, then 
, so 
. As 
, 
. Now, for each 
, 
, so again by Proposition 3.14, there is no path from 
 to y in 
.

Since, by hypothesis, 
 is connected, we have our contradiction. □

4. Isomorphism and coordination sequences
Every periodic graph may be represented by a finite voltage graph ([46]; for voltage graphs, see [47]), and thus there are only countably many periodic graphs modulo isomorphism. However, we will demonstrate that from a single suitable periodic graph, the cut-and-project method can obtain uncountably many mutually non-isomorphic model graphs. Recall that if Γ is a graph and 
, then the coordination sequence of v is the function 
. We will suppress Γ in 
 if understood.

Notice that if there is an isomorphism from a graph 
 onto 
 that maps 
 to 
, then 
. Notice if a graph Γ has several orbits of vertices under its automorphism group, there would very likely (but not necessarily) be a distinct coordination sequence to each orbit. (If there is only one orbit of vertices, the graph is vertex transitive.)

But while coordination sequences are graph invariants, they are not canonical, for there are pairs of non-isomorphic vertex-transitive periodic graphs with the same coordination sequence. For example, the vertex transitive crystal structures lta and rho (see [48] and [49]) have the same coordination sequence, defined by 
 ([50]) for each vertex v. Abandoning vertex transitivity, there are uncountable collections of graphs with the same collection of coordination sequences. For example, for each 
, let  if 
 is even and let  if I is odd. Then let
 and
 
 
 and
 for 
 and 
. Then the coordination sequences in 
 and in 
 from  are the same. For example, in Fig. 10, 
 has a vertical edge in every other 4-cycle while 
 has one in every third 4-cycle, so they are not isomorphic. But they have the same set of coordination sequences. In both 
 and 
, coordination sequences from vertices of degree four are the same: for any such vertex u,  while  implies . For any vertex v of degree three, the coordination sequence is , , and for ,  while for any vertex w of degree 2, the coordination sequence is , , , and if , .

Fig. 10. These graphs share the same coordination sequences even though they are not isomorphic. Thus coordination sequences are not canonical invariants.

4.1. The number of coordination sequences
In this section, we show that one can obtain uncountably many isomorphically distinct model graphs from any periodic graph. We will need to look very carefully at the boundary of the window.

Definition 4.1

Let 
 and let 
 be a convex regular open set. Let 
. We define the leading frontier of W with respect to e to be
 and the trailing frontier of W with respect to e to be
 Let 
.

We will write 
 if e is understood. Notice that 
 could be a proper subset of ∂W: suppose that 
 and that W was the open parallelogram bounded by 0, 
, 
, and 
. If 
, then 
﹨
 as the endpoint 
 admits no  such that 
, and the same for the endpoint 
 as W is open. And 
﹨

. Similarly, if 
, then 
﹨
 while 
﹨

. On the other hand, if 
, then
﹨
 while
﹨
 and 
. Notice that in general if W is open and convex, then W's leading and trailing frontiers are disjoint and do not cover the boundary of W.

For each , let 
, and if W is open and convex, 
, i.e. 
. From this it follows that for any r and 
 such that 
, we have 
, which can be seen as follows. This is immediate if dim
, so suppose that dim
. If 
, then 
 but also, for some 
, . W.l.o.g. suppose that 
 and notice that 
. As dim
, choose  such that , and that  is perpendicular to 
. As , there exists  such that 
 is so small that the triangle of corners w, y, and z has  in its interior, contradicting the convexity of W. By the same argument, for any r, 
, 
, 
.

We specialize the notion of genericity given in Definition 3.18.

Definition 4.2

Let Γ be a graph in 
 and suppose that 
 is in doubly general position with respect to Γ. Let 
 be a convex open set. Say that W is e-generic with respect to Γ and  if, for any , 
.

Since Γ and  will be understood in the sequel, we will typically just say that W is e-generic.

Notice that as 
 is countable, and as 
 implies that 
, 
 can intersect at most countably many sets in the ensemble 
.

The simplest examples may be parallelopiped-shaped windows.

Example 4.3

Suppose that we have a periodic graph Γ in 
 and let 
. Suppose that 
 and let 
⁎
 and let

 onto 
. Let 
⁎

⁎
-dimensional subspaces spanning 
 such that 
 for each 
⁎
. For each 
⁎
, let 
 be such that if x and y are distinct intersection points of 
⁎
 of the hyperplanes 
, 
⁎
, then 
. These 
⁎
 hyperplanes in 
 define a polytope whose interior we denote W. Further, ∂W is the union of 
⁎
 facets: let 
 and 
 for each 
⁎

) and 
. But

 so 
. Let

, and W is 
-generic for each i. But notice that if

, then ∂W is not generic with respect to 
: for any 
 such that 
 is less than the minimal distance between any two corners of W, as 
 does not lie in any 
, there exists b such that l and 
 lie on adjacent facets of the parallelopiped .

We will need the following notion.

Definition 4.4

Given a graph Γ and an edge 
, the length of that edge is the distance between the two endpoints. The mesh of Γ is 
.

Notice that if Γ has finitely many building blocks, then it has a finite mesh. In particular, a periodic graph has a finite mesh.

We are ready for the main theorem.

Theorem 4.5

Let Γ be a graph in 
, . Let 
 be in doubly general position with respect to Γ and such that 
 is dense on 
. Let W be convex, open, and e-generic with respect to Γ and  and such that the corresponding model system  bounds distances. Then there exist uncountably many distinct coordination sequences among the model graphs in , and hence uncountably many mutually non-isomorphic model graphs.

Notice that in order for  to be in doubly general position with respect to Γ, its dimension must be at least 3. With a few tweaks, the above is true for any model system indexed by a set 
 such that I has an open subset and 
 is dense in that open subset.

Proof of Theorem 4.5

We will prove that for any 
 such that 
, there exist uncountably many distinct coordination sequences among the model graphs 
, 
. Since each model graph is countable, there must be uncountably many mutually non-isomorphic model graphs to accommodate all the coordination sequences.

Without loss of generality, suppose 
, 
, 
 ⊆W, and 
; as 
 is countable and 
 is nowhere dense (as W is convex), 
 is of measure 0. Denote the coordination sequence from a vertex v in 
 by 
, and thus its kth entry is 
. We employ the notion of a boolean string: this is just a sequence, finite or infinite, of 0s and 1s. Let 
⁎
 be the set of finite binary strings, let “⋅” be concatenation of strings (so that ), and let 
 mean that ι is a prefix of 
 in that for some string 
, 
. Let ϵ be the “empty” string of length zero, and let 
 be the set of infinite boolean strings, which we will treat as functions 
. We will construct coordination sequences for a set of model graphs 
: denote 
 by 
 and 
 by 
. Let  be the length of ι. It will be important that while 
⁎
 is countable, 
 is uncountable.

By recursion, we will construct a pair of indexed sets, 
⁎
 of positive reals and 
⁎
 of reals, and a function 
⁎
 such that the following Conditions hold:

1.
Let 
, 
, and .

2.
If 
, then 
 and, in addition, if  then 
.

3.
If 
 and 
, then there exists 
 such that 
.

4.
For each ι, if 
 and 
, then

5.
Furthermore, 
.

6.
If 
 and 
, if 
 is the maximum common prefix, then 
 and 
, . In particular, if 
, we have 
, .

7.
If 
, then 
.

Notice that if 
 are the prefixes of an infinite string I so that 
 for each positive integer n, then for any positive integer N, if , then by Conditions 5 and 7, 
, so 
 is a Cauchy sequence, which thus converges.
We first claim that the existence of these indexed sets and this function proves the theorem.

Denote each infinite boolean string by a function 
 such that for each nonnegative integer n,  is the nth entry: thus for the infinite string 101010101⋯, . And for each infinite boolean string J, let 
⁎
⁎
 be such that for each 
, 
⁎
: thus for the infinite string 101010101⋯, 
⁎
. Then for each infinite boolean string, we have a sequence of finite boolean strings 
⁎
, with a corresponding sequence of model graphs 
⁎
. As the sequence 
⁎
 converges to a limit we denote 
, so does the sequence 
⁎
, and hence by Proposition 3.14, so does the sequence 
⁎
, and let 
 
 
⁎
⁎
.

By Conditions 6, 5, and 7, if 
, then letting n be the least integer with 
, we have
⁎
⁎
⁎
 
⁎
 
⁎
 for  and , so we have uncountably many displacements 
. As no point in 
 can lie in more than one leading frontier and in more than one trailing frontier, at most countably many sets 
 intersect 
, so 
⁎
 is of cardinality 
, so we restrict our attention to  and observe that if , then 
⁎
.

Denote 
 by 
. By construction, if 
, then there is a minimal n such that 
, and by Conditions 2, 3, and 4, there exists 
⁎
⁎
 such that 
⁎
⁎
. Thus each  has its own coordination sequence from 0, and hence there are uncountably many coordination sequences from 0.

We now demonstrate the existence of these indexed sets. Recall that we are denoting the vertex set of 
 by 
, and edge-distance on 
 by 
. We now carry out the construction, and as  bounds distances, and as there are only finitely many vertices of Γ at any particular edge-distance from 0, there exists a continuous and increasing function 
 such that for any 
 and any 
, if 
 then 
. If the mesh (maximum edge-length) of Γ is e, then for any vertex 
 on a path from 0 to v of length 
, we have 
.

But first, let 
 and observe that as 
 is dense in 
, K is dense in 
. Without loss of generality, we have supposed that , and we start with 
, 
 and , thus satisfying Condition 1. During our induction, we will maintain 
 so that 
. Suppose that we have 
, 
 and  and that all the conditions hold thus far. We construct 
, 
, and  for  as follows.

Choose  such that 
 and such that if 
 and 
, then 
. Thus the induced subgraphs 
 have the same vertex set for all 
﹨, and hence are the same subgraph, so when we set 
, that will satisfy Conditions 5 and 6. We now turn to the vertices that are further away.

As 
 is dense in 
, for each 
, there exist vertices 
 such that 
. Thus there exists R such that for some 
 
, there exists r, 
, such that 
; as 
 is uniformly discrete, the set of such numbers R is uniformly discrete, and we can choose the least such R and let 
 
 and there exists 
 such that 
. We now want to capture all the vertices that could be within edge distance 
 of 0 in any 
, 
. Let
 and to get a ball around 0 to contain them all, let
 Notice that 
. Let
 and let
 and notice that 
, and thus  is finite. In addition, as 
,  is nonempty.

Here is the situation. We have a set of vertices  that induce a subgraph consisting of all vertices of distance at most  from 0 in every 
 for 
 (and Condition 2 will hold). We have a set of vertices 
﹨ that contain all the other vertices within distance N in every 
, 
. (We do not care if this set is empty or not.) And we have a set of vertices  whose inclusion or exclusion in the model graph might change a kth entry of the coordination sequence for ; note that 
.

As W is e-generic, no two vertices of  may share the same parameter r. Without loss of generality, suppose that 
, and choose 
 such that for any  and any r, if 
 then 
. Then all induced subgraphs 
 such that 
 have the same vertex set except for 
, which is missing in such 
 with 
. Then choose 
﹨ and 
﹨. Letting 
, all vertices of distances at most 
 from 0 maintain their distances from 0, except for 
, which disappears if 
. Thus
 and the coordination sequences of 
 and 
 are distinct, thus satisfying Condition 3.

Now set
 
 thus satisfying Conditions 6, 5, and 7. And Condition 4 holds as W is open. □

5. Conclusions
Model systems of graphs and complexes may provide designs for novel crystallographic materials different from those derived from periodic structures. Yet many of the results in this note - most notably Theorem 4.5, whose hypotheses look rather technical and over-restrictive - are rather partial and should be developed further. The effort may be worth the trouble if the primary message of this article is that model graphs and complexes may be of interest and be useful, and there are methods for addressing, finessing, or evading complications like collisions. For example, given a model system, it may be possible to derive properties common to almost all model graphs or complexes arising from that system, and it may be possible to determine stoichiometric proportions of building blacks for assembling model graphs or complexes of that system. This possibility may merit further study.

There are many graph-theoretic properties to explore, and we have presented one of them. The fact that a single model system yields uncountably many model graphs with distinct coordination sequences does imply that using coordination sequences to catalog model systems (for it is probably the model systems that we should catalog) may be problematic. But following [33], the ensemble of coordination sequences of a given model system may tell us something about that system - and thus be useful for analyzing model systems associated with particular periodic graphs.
