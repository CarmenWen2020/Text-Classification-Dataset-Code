Abstract
Rough set theory is a granular computing tool used to deal with ambiguity and uncertainty in information systems. However, many optimization problems in rough sets, such as attribute reduction, are NP-hard problems, and most of the algorithms for these problems are greedy. As a complex mathematical structure, matroids provide a powerful tool for solving combinatorial optimization problems related to attribute reduction. Therefore, it is necessary to study the combination of matroids and rough sets. This paper uses rough sets and matrix approaches to spanning matroids. Moreover, the features of spanning matroids are applied to attribute reduction in decision information systems. Firstly, we construct spanning sets based on equivalence relations which can induce matroids called spanning matroids. Secondly, some features of spanning matroids, such as closed sets, bases, are studied by matrix method. Finally, the judgment theorems with the features of spanning matroids are proposed for addressing the problems about attribute reduction in decision information systems. Simultaneously, the sufficient and necessary conditions for distinguishing upper approximation reduction in inconsistent decision information systems are obtained from the viewpoint of spanning matroids.

1. Introduction
The uncertainty and incompleteness of information granules is a common phenomenon in information systems. Rough sets, proposed by Pawlak [14], provide an important mathematical tool for dealing with data preprocessing in information systems. Rough sets have been widely used in theory and practice. In theory, the axiomatic system of rough sets has been gradually developed, generalized rough set models have been established [1], [6], [7], [8], [11], [46], [47], and the connections with other methods have been investigated [2], [9], [10], [15], [17], [19], [25], [38], [30]. In application, rough sets have been widely used to deal with some practical problems, such as attribute reduction [18], [17], [24], [25], [27], [39], rule extraction [4], [5], [22], knowledge discovery [20], [32], [36] and so on.

Most of the optimization problems related to rough sets are NP-hard problems required greedy algorithm to solve. In order to establish mathematical models for solving these optimization problems, rough sets have been combined with other theories, such as topology [38], [48], graph theory [40], [41], matroid theory [3], [12], [13], [26], [28], [29]. Especially, as an extension of vector linear space, matroids [16] provide a perfect mathematical model for solving optimization problems. Therefore, researching rough sets with matroids may help to solve some optimization problems.

Recently, the research on the combination of matroids and rough sets has been developed with fruitful achievements [22], [35], [43], [45]. Zhu et al. presented definitions of lower and upper rough matroids based on relations from the viewpoint of approximation operators [29]. Li and Liu studied the axiomatic system of rough sets from the view of matroids [33]. Moreover, they discussed rough sets by matroidal approaches from viewpoint of lattice theory [34]. Tang et al. redefined the rough approximation operators through matroidal method, and established a type of matroidal structure of rough sets [13]. Liu et al. obtained matroidal structures of generalized rough sets based on serial and transitive relations [42]. Su et al. presented matroidal structures of covering rough sets, and the structures of modular matroids based on closed set lattices are given [37].

Matrix method for studying rough sets and matroids has been a popular research topic in recent years [19], [20], [21], [28], [35], [43]. Wang et al. used graph and matrix methods to study rough sets by matroids caused by equivalence relations. Huang et al. proposed nullity-based matroids of rough sets and used matrix approach to characterize the matroids [35]. Tan and Li studied reduction in covering decision information systems by matrix-based methods and the notions of minimal and maximal descriptions in covering decision information systems were proposed [20], [21]. In addition, matrices have been used as the construction of some theoretical foundations and applications, such as discernibility matrix [23], [44]. In a framework, it is interesting and useful to study rough sets through various methods including matrix methods.

In this paper, we study the matroidal structures of rough sets with matrix approach and apply them to attribute reduction in decision information systems. First, we introduce the notion of spanning matroids and some results including bases, closed sets, are presented. Second, based on the upper and lower approximation matrices 
 
 
  induced by an equivalence relation, some characteristics of spanning matroids are investigated with matrix approach, where matrix representations of spanning matroids are established through rough sets. Finally, a new method based on the obtained results of spanning matroids is established for addressing the problems about attribute reduction in decision information systems. Further, the sufficient and necessary conditions for distinguishing upper approximation reduction in an inconsistent decision information system are obtained from the viewpoint of matroids.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review some basic knowledge about rough sets and matroids. In Section 3, the notion of spanning matroid and their characteristics are investigated through rough sets. In Section 4, the matrix representations of spanning matroids are established based on upper and lower approximation matrices 
 
 
 . In Section 5, new judgment theorems are found for addressing the problems about attribute reduction in decision information systems from the viewpoint of matroids. The conclusions of this study are presented in Section 6.

2. Background
In this section, we review some basic concepts in classical rough sets and matroids. Throughout this paper, we always assume that the universe of discourse U is a nonempty finite set. The family of all subsets of U is denoted by 
. For 
, we denote the complement of X in U as ∼X, i.e. . When X is a finite set, the cardinality of X is denoted as .

(4H) R⁎(X)=∼R⁎(∼X);	(4L) R⁎(X)=∼R⁎(∼X);
(5H) R⁎(∼R⁎(X))=∼R⁎(X);	(5L) R⁎(∼R⁎(X))=∼R⁎(X);
(6H) X ⊆ Y⇒R⁎(X)⊆R⁎(Y).	
2.2. Matroids
As the abstraction and generalization of graph theory and linear algebra, matroid theory is a theoretical method for handling some complexity data. In this section, we introduce some important features of matroids such as base, spanning set, etc.

Definition 1

(Matroid [16]) A matroid M is a pair , where U is a nonempty finite set, and  (called independent set) is a subfamily of 
 which satisfies the following three axioms:

;

If 
, then 
;

If 
 and 
, then there exists 
 such that 
.

As we all know, matroids are a generalization of linear space. In the following, we give an example about vector independence to illustrate the concept of matroids.

Example 1

Given a matrix , where 
, 
, 
 and 
 are four column vectors. The label set of the column vectors in A is denoted by 
. Then 
 is an independent set if and only if the column vector group with respect to I is linearly independent for any . Namely,  is a matroids.

In order to explain some concepts in this paper, we give the following symbols.

Definition 2

(Matroid [16]) Suppose  is a family of subsets of U. Some symbols are defined as follows:

The base is an important feature of matroids. In fact, the bases are the collection of the largest independent sets in a matroid.

Definition 3

(Base [16]) Suppose  is a matroid. A maximal independent set in M is called a base of M, and the set of all the bases of M is denoted by

.

The rank function is an ensemble quantified formula, in which the cardinality of the largest independent set can be expressed.

Definition 4

 of M is defined as:

Definition 5

(Closure operator and closed set [16]) Suppose  is a matroid. The closure operator 
 of M is defined as
 
 is called the closure of X in M. Moreover, X is called a closed set if 
.

The spanning set is an important concept in matroids. They contain all the bases of a matroid.

Definition 6

(Spanning set [16]) Suppose  is a matroid. For any 
, if there exists a base  such that , then S is called a spanning set of M. The family of all the spanning sets of M is denoted by .

The following proposition shows that a matroid can be defined from the viewpoint of spanning sets, which is the method of constructing matroids used in this paper.

Proposition 2

(Spanning set axiom [16]) Suppose  is a subset family of 
.  is a family of all spanning sets of matroid M if and only if  satisfies the following conditions:

.

If 
, and 
, then 
.

If 
, then there exists 
 such that 
.

There are many ways to define or construct a matroid. We can generate a matroid according to the following closure axiom of matroids.

5. Applying spanning matroid to attribute reduction in information systems
Based on the results obtained in Section 3, this section applies spanning matroidal structures to discuss the problem of attribute reduction in decision information systems. Firstly, we introduce consistent and inconsistent decision information systems as follows. Detailed description of the theory can be found in [31], [32].

An information system  is a table , where U is a nonempty finite set of objects, AT is a nonempty finite set of attributes, 
 is a set of information functions, where 
, and where the set 
 is the rang of attribute a. For any , the indiscernibility relation is induced as 
.

, and 
 is the rang of decision attribute d. Similarly, the indiscernibility relation is induced as 
, and a partition 
 forms.

6. Conclusions
In this paper, we introduced the notion of spanning matroids induced by equivalence relations. Based on the constructed upper and lower approximation matrices 
 
 
 , the matrix representations of some characteristics of spanning matroids have been well expressed. Based on the features of spanning matroids, we studied the problems of attribute reduction in an consistent DIS and presented a matroidal method for searching for decision reductions. Furthermore, we have obtained the sufficient and necessary condition for upper approximation reduction in an inconsistent DIS from the viewpoint of matroids. Although some work has been done in this paper, there are still some interesting questions to be considered as follows.

(1)
Matrix representation of matroids based on covering rough sets. How to use matrix to describe some important concepts of matroids based on covering rough sets is an interesting topic.

(2)
Matrix representation of spanning matroids and its application to incomplete information systems. When analyzing data, some data is often missing or incomplete in an information system. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the application of the method in this paper to attribute reduction of an incomplete information system.

(3)
Spanning matroids based on covering rough sets and attribute reduction of covering decision information systems. The research on attribute reduction of covering decision information systems has attracted the attention of many scholars. The attribute reduction method based on spanning matroid is also a potential research topic.

In the future work, we will focus on the above three research topics. In addition, the algorithm design based on matroids will be one of our future work.
