Abstract
Connectivity and diagnosability are very important parameters for the tolerant of an interconnection network. Let F be a vertex set of graph G, the g-extra connectivity k˜(g)(G) of G requires each component of G−F has at least (g+1) vertices. The g-extra conditional diagnosability t˜(g)(G) is the maximum number of faulty vertices that the graph can be guaranteed to identify under the condition that each fault-free component has at least g+1 vertices. In this paper, we study the problem about the g-extra connectivity k˜(g)(G) of the round matching composition networks, and obtain some results about the g-extra conditional diagnosability of the round matching composition networks under the PMC model and MM* model, respectively.

1. Introduction
The classical connectivity is an important parameter for measuring the reliability of an interconnection network. Reliability evaluation of interconnection network is important to the design and maintenance of multiprocessor systems. Motivated by the shortcomings of traditional connectivity measurements, in 1996, the g-extra connectivity 
 of the interconnection network G was introduced by Fábrega and Fiol [2]. The g-extra connectivity 
 of G has been widely studied [1], [3], [5], [6], [10], [12]. A subset of vertices F is said to be a cut set if  is not connected. A cut set F is called an 
-cut set, and g is a non-negative integer, if every component of  has at least  vertices. 
 is the minimum number of vertices whose deletion will disconnect the network and every remaining component has more than g vertices. Multiprocessor systems consist of thousands of processors. It is very important to identify the fault processors when evaluating the reliability of multiprocessor systems. The process of identifying the fault processors is called the diagnosis of the system. A system is said to be t-diagnosability if the number of fault processors presented does not exceed t and all the fault processors can be identified. The diagnosability  is the maximum value of t such that G is t-diagnosable.

Two well-known diagnostic models to identify the faulty processors are the PMC model and MM model, proposed by Preparata et al. [9] and Maeng et al. [7] respectively. The MM* model introduced by Sengupta and Dahbura [11], it is a special case of the MM model, which requires that each processor be able to test any two processors adjacent to it.

In the PMC model, for any two adjacent vertices u and v, u is able to test v. The outcomes have three cases: (1) if u is a faulty node, then the outcome is unreliable; (2) if u and v are both fault-free, then the outcome is 0. (3) if u is a fault-free, v is faulty, then the outcome is 1.  to denote the outcome of vertex u testing vertex v, that is
  where F is the set of faulty vertices.

In the MM* model, the vertex w is a comparator of a pair of vertices , if  and . The outcome of the comparison is denoted by 
, that is
  where F is the set of faulty vertices.

This paper studies the g-extra connectivity and the g-extra conditional diagnosability of the round matching composition networks. In Section 2, we introduce some necessary terminologies and preliminaries used in this paper. In Section 3, we study the problems about the g-extra connectivity of the round matching composition networks. In Section 4, we study the problems about g-extra conditional diagnosability of the round matching composition networks under the PMC model and MM* model, respectively.

2. Preliminaries
2.1. Terminologies and notations
A multiprocessor system is modeled as a graph , whose vertices represent processors and edges represent communication links.  is called induced subgraph, whose vertex set is H and edge set consists of all the edges of G with both ends in H. Let 
, 
 be two different subsets of V, 
 be the symmetric difference. For any vertex v, the neighborhood 
. Let , the set 
 is denoted by 
. We use  to replace 
,  to replace 
, and  to replace 
. A graph G is said to be k-regular if  for any vertex . For any subset ,  or  denotes a graph obtained by removing all vertices in F from G. If there exists a nonempty subset  such that  is disconnected, then F is called a vertex-cut of G. The connectivity  is the minimum number of vertices whose removal results in a disconnected graph or only one vertex left. Let  be the maximum number of common neighbors between any two vertices in G.

2.2. The round matching composition networks
We provide the definition of the round matching composition networks and its structural properties, which are useful to the following discussion.

2.3. Two diagnostic models and the g-extra diagnosability
In diagnosis theory, PMC model and MM* model are two diagnostic models. Now we give some definitions and lemmas which will be used in the proof of our main result.

Definition 2

[13] For a graph , a vertex subset F is a g-extra fault-set if each component of  has more than g vertices.

Definition 3

[13] For a graph , a g-extra cut is a g-extra fault-set F such that  is disconnected. G is said to be g-extra connected if G has a g-extra cut. The minimum cardinality of g-extra cuts is said to be the g-extra connectivity of G, denoted by 
.

Definition 4

[8] A graph  is g-extra conditional t-diagnosable if and only if for each pair of distinct fauly g-extra sets 
 such that 
, 
, and 
 are distinguishable. The g-extra conditional diagnosability 
 is the maximum value of t such that G is g-extra conditionally t-diagnosable, i.e., 
. (See Fig. 1, Fig. 2.)

Lemma 3.2

Suppose

Proof

Suppose, to the contrary, that there exists one g-extra conditional fault cut set F with

4. The g-extra conditional diagnosability of the round matching composition networks
Next, by calculating the upper and lower bounds of 
, obtain the exact value of the g-extra conditional diagnosability of RMCN under the PMC model and MM* model.

Lemma 4.1

Suppose 
 is a RMCN of 
 
 for , where 
 is a k-regular k-connected triangle free graph with 
 and 
 for every , , . For any two vertices 
, if 
, we have 
. Then 
 
 under the PMC and MM* model.

Proof

Let A be a vertex subset of 
 with

, 
. By Lemma 3.3, we have 
 are g-extra vertex sets and
 
 
 
 We know 
 and there is no edge between 
 and 
. For any vertex 
, there is no vertex 
 adjacent to u. So 
 and 
 are indistinguishable under the PMC and MM* model. Thus, G is not g-extra 
 
-diagnosable by Definition 4. Then 
 
 under the PMC and MM* model.

The following result is very useful in many specific applications.

Corollary 4.1

Let  be a connected graph. If 
 and 
 are two g-extra fault-sets, then 
 is also a g-extra fault-set under PMC model.

Proof

When 
, we have 
, then 
. Thus, 
 is a g-extra fault-set. The case of 
 can be similarly argued. Therefore, we suppose that 
 and 
.

For each component 
 in 
 has 
, since it is outside of 
 and 
 is a g-extra fault-set, thus 
 is also outside 
. For each component 
 in 
 has 
, since it is outside of 
 and 
 is a g-extra fault-set, thus 
 is also outside 
. Finally, let 
 be a component in 
, it is outside both 
 and 
, it contains at least  vertices outside 
 by definition, 
 is outside 
, as well. Hence, 
 is also a g-extra fault-set.

Lemma 4.2

Suppose 
 is a RMCN of 
 
 for , where 
 is a k-regular k-connected triangle free graph with 
 and 
 for every , , . For any two vertices 
, if 
, we have 
. Then 
 
 under the PMC model.

Proof

Suppose that 
 and 
 be any a pair of different g-extra conditional fault-set and 
 
 . Prove the lemma by showing that 
 and 
 are distinguishable under PMC model. Suppose, to the contrary, there exists a pair of different g-extra conditional fault-set 
 and it is indistinguishable under the PMC model.

Since ﹨
 
, 
. G is connected and 
 is indistinguishable, there exists no edges between 
 and 
. Note that 
 and 
 are two distinct g-extra conditional fault-set, 
 is a g-extra vertex-cut by Corollary 4.1. By Theorem 3.1, 
 
. On the other hand, 
, without loss of generality, we assume that 
. Since 
 is a g-extra conditional fault-set, 
. Thus,
 
 
 This is contradiction with 
 
.

Therefore, G is g-extra 
 
-diagnosable, i.e., 
 
.

Theorem 4.2

Suppose 
 is a RMCN of 
 
 for , where 
 is a k-regular k-connected triangle free graph with 
 and 
 for every , , . For any two vertices 
, if 
, we have 
. Then 
 
 under the PMC model.

Proof

Combining Lemma 4.1 and Lemma 4.2, the theorem holds.

Now, we investigate the g-extra conditional diagnosability of G under the MM* model. The idea used to get a lower bound result of the g-extra conditional diagnosability under the MM* model is similar to that for the PMC model, except that we need to show that no isolated vertex exists in 
 and 
, where 
 is the pair of indistinguishable g-extra conditional fault-sets. If u is an isolated vertex in 
 under MM* model, it can be adjacent to some vertex in 
. Then, 
 would not be a vertex cut set.

Lemma 4.3

Suppose 
 is a RMCN of 
 
 for 
 
 
, where 
 is a k-regular k-connected triangle free graph with 
 and 
 for every , , . For any two vertices 
, if 
, we have 
. Then 
 
 under the MM* model.

Proof

Suppose, to the contrary, that 
 
. From Definition 4, there exist two distinct g-extra conditional fault-sets 
 and 
 with 
 
 and 
 
, but 
 and 
 are indistinguishable. Note that ﹨
, we have 
.

Claim

There exists no isolated vertex in 
.

Suppose, to the contrary, the set of all isolated vertices in 
 is W and there exists at least one isolated vertex in W, say , and let 
.

If 
, then 
. Since w is an isolated vertex of 
 and 
 is a g-extra conditional fault-set, then , which contradicts that . Hence, 
. Similarly, we have 
.

Now we show that 
 and 
. Since 
 and 
 are distinct g-extra conditional fault-set, , 
 and 
. If there exist two vertices 
, such that , then 
 and 
 are distinguishable, which contradicts with the fact that 
 and 
 are indistinguishable. Thus 
. Similarly, we have 
. Since G is -regular graph, we have
and 
 
 
 
which implies that
 
 
 
 Next we show 
 is not an empty set.
 
 
 
 Hence, . Since 
 and 
 are two distinct indistinguishable g-extra conditional fault-sets, it is easy to see that 
 is a g-extra vertex cut. We have 
 
 by Theorme 3.1. Note that 
 
 and 
 
, then 
, 
.

Next we shall prove that . Suppose, to the contrary, that . Each pair of vertices in W has at most two common neighbors by , we have
  Since 
 
, we have
 
 
 
 
 a contradiction.

Let 
. Since 
 and 
 are two distinct indistinguishable g-extra conditional fault-set, there is no edge between A and H. Clearly, 
 and . Since 
 and 
. Futhermore,  when 
 
. We have 
 
 by Lemma 3.1. Thus 
 
 
 for 
 
 
, a contradiction.

The proof of claim is complete.

By claim, there exists no isolated vertex in 
. Note that 
 and 
 are indistinguishable, there no edge between 
 and 
. Since 
 and 
 are two distinct g-extra fault-sets, 
 is a g-extra cut sets. Thus, we have
 and by Theorem 3.1
 
 Hence, we have
 
 
 
 a contradiction.

Theorem 4.3

Suppose 
 is a RMCN of 
 
 for 
 
 
, where 
 is a k-regular k-connected triangle free graph with 
 and 
 for every , , . For any two vertices 
, if 
, we have 
. Then 
 
 under the MM* model.

Proof

From Lemma 4.1, Lemma 4.3, this theorem hold.

5. Conclusion
The extra connectivity and extra conditional diagnosability are two important metrics for fault tolerance of multiprocessor systems. In this paper we first get the extra connectivity of the round matching composition networks is 
 
 for , . Then show that the extra conditional diagnosability of the round matching composition networks under PMC model (
 
) and MM* model (
 
 
 
) is 
 
, respectively. On the basis of this study, the researchers can continue to study the g-extra connectivity and diagnosability of other types of graphs.
