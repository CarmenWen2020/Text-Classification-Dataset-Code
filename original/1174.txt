Abstract
Given a vertex-colored graph, we say a path is a rainbow vertex path if all its internal vertices have distinct colors. The graph is rainbow vertex-connected if there is a rainbow vertex path between every pair of its vertices. In the Rainbow Vertex Coloring (RVC) problem we want to decide whether the vertices of a given graph can be colored with at most k colors so that the graph becomes rainbow vertex-connected. This problem is known to be NP-complete even in very restricted scenarios, and very few efficient algorithms are known for it. In this work, we give polynomial-time algorithms for RVC on permutation graphs, powers of trees and split strongly chordal graphs. The algorithm for the latter class also works for the strong variant of the problem, where the rainbow vertex paths between each vertex pair must be shortest paths. We complement the polynomial-time solvability results for split strongly chordal graphs by showing that, for any fixed p≥3 both variants of the problem become NP-complete when restricted to split (S3,…,Sp)-free graphs, where Sq denotes the q-sun graph.

1. Introduction
Graph coloring is a classic problem within the field of structural and algorithmic graph theory that has been widely studied in many variants. An example is the rainbow coloring problem, which is an edge coloring problem [3], [13], [14]. One recent variant was defined by Krivelevich and Yuster [10] and has received significant attention: the rainbow vertex coloring problem. A vertex-colored graph is said to be rainbow vertex-connected if between any pair of its vertices, there is a path whose internal vertices are colored with distinct colors. Such a path is called a rainbow path. A rainbow vertex coloring of a graph G is a coloring under which G is rainbow vertex-connected. Note that this vertex coloring does not need to be a proper one; for instance, a complete graph is rainbow vertex-connected under the coloring that assigns the same color to every vertex. The Rainbow Vertex Coloring (RVC) problem takes as input a graph G and an integer k and asks whether G has a rainbow vertex coloring with k colors. The rainbow vertex connection number of a graph G is the smallest number of colors needed in one such coloring and is denoted . More recently, Li et al. [12] defined a stronger variant of this problem by requiring that the rainbow paths connecting the pairs of vertices are also shortest paths between those pairs. In this case we say the graph is strong rainbow vertex-connected. The analogous computational problem is called Strong Rainbow Vertex Coloring (SRVC) and the corresponding parameter is denoted by .

Both the RVC and the SRVC problems are NP-complete for every  [5], [4], [6], and remain NP-complete even on bipartite graphs and split graphs [8]. Both problems are also NP-hard to approximate within a factor of 
 for every , even when restricted to bipartite graphs and split graphs [8]. Contrasting these results, it was shown that RVC and SRVC are linear-time solvable on bipartite permutation graphs and block graphs [8], and on planar graphs for every fixed k [11]. In fact, if k is fixed, both problems are also solvable in linear time on graphs of constant treewidth and in cubic time on graphs of constant clique-width, as they can be expressed in monadic second order logic [6]. Furthermore, they are also solvable in linear time on graphs of vertex cover at most p, for any fixed p [6]. Finally, RVC is also known to be linear time solvable on interval graphs [8].

The above mentioned results on bipartite permutation graphs and interval graphs led Heggernes et al. [8] to formulate the following conjecture concerning diametral path graphs. A graph G is a diametral path graph if every induced subgraph H has a diametral path P that is dominating. Recall that a diametral path is a shortest path whose length is equal to the diameter, and that dominating means that every vertex either is in P, or is adjacent to a vertex in P.

Conjecture 1.1

Heggernes et al. [8, Conjecture 15]
Let G be a diametral path graph. Then .

In this context, it is interesting to remark that both bipartite permutation graphs and interval graphs are diametral path graphs, and that Heggernes et al. [8] showed that the conjecture is true for these graphs.

We remark that similar bounds were studied for the edge variant of the problem, in which we want to color the edges of a graph in such a way that every pair of vertices is connected by a path whose edges received pairwise distinct colors (a rainbow path). For instance, it is known that AT-free graphs (a subclass of diametral path graphs) can be rainbow edge colored with  colors. However, there are examples of such graphs G that need  colors to be rainbow edge colored [18].

Our results  Our main contribution is to show that the above conjecture is true for permutation graphs.

Theorem A

=Theorem 3.16
If G is a permutation graph on n vertices, then  and the corresponding rainbow vertex coloring can be found in 
 time.

This generalizes the earlier result on bipartite permutation graphs [8]. The proof of our result follows from a thorough investigation of shortest paths in permutation graphs. We show that there are two special shortest paths that ensure that a rainbow vertex coloring with  colors can be found.

We also investigate the rainbow vertex connection number of chordal graphs further. As the problem is NP-hard and hard to approximate on split graphs [8], the hope for polynomial-time solvability rests either within subclasses of split graphs or other chordal graphs that are not inclusion-wise related to split graphs (such as the previously studied interval graphs and block graphs [8]). We make progress in both directions. First, we show that the problem is polynomial-time solvable on split strongly chordal graphs.

Theorem B

=Theorem 4.3
If G is a split strongly chordal graph with ℓ cut vertices, then .

In order to obtain the above result, we exploit an interesting structural property of split strongly chordal graphs. Namely, if G is a split strongly chordal graph with clique K and independent set S, there exists a spanning tree of  such that the neighborhood of each vertex of S induces a subtree of this tree.

Second, we show that RVC remains polynomial-time solvable on powers of trees. This proof is based on a case analysis, depending on whether the diameter of the tree is a multiple of the power and how many long branches the tree has. In some cases,  many colors are enough to obtain a rainbow vertex coloring of these graphs, but surprisingly this is not always true. There are graphs in this graph class that actually require  colors in order to be rainbow vertex colored. We provide a complete characterization of such graphs, as well as a polynomial time algorithm to optimally rainbow vertex color any power of tree.

Theorem C

=Theorem 5.10
If G is a power of a tree, then , and the corresponding optimal rainbow vertex coloring can be found in time that is linear in the size of G.

An extended abstract of this work appeared in the Proceedings of the 45th International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science (MFCS 2020) [15].

2. Preliminaries
Whenever we write graph, we will mean a finite undirected simple graph. We assume throughout that all graphs are connected and have at least four vertices.

Let  be a graph. For two vertices , we use  to denote that u and v are adjacent. For a vertex , we write 
 for its degree. For a subgraph H of G, we write 
 for the set of vertices of H. Specifically, for a path P in G, we write 
 for the vertices of P. If , then by  we denote the subgraph of G induced by X, that is, . We use  and .

The length of a path P equals the number of edges of P. The distance 
 is the length of a shortest -path in G. If the graph G is clear from the context, we simply write . The diameter  of G is the length of the longest shortest path between two vertices in G, that is, 
. A center of a graph G is a vertex c such that 
 is minimum among all vertices of G. Note that a graph can have multiple centers and that a tree can have at most two.

A graph G is a chordal graph if every cycle 
 on  vertices has a chord, meaning an edge between two non-consecutive vertices of the cycle.

A graph G is a split graph if 
 can be split into two sets, K and S, such that K induces a clique in G and S induces an independent set in G.

For any , we denote by 
 the k-sun on 2k vertices, that is, a graph with a clique 
 on k vertices and an independent set 
 of k vertices such that 
 is adjacent to 
 and 
 for every  and 
 is adjacent to 
 and 
. A graph G is a strongly chordal graph if it is chordal and every even cycle C of length at least six has a chord uv such that the distance in C between u and v is odd. The strongly chordal graphs are exactly the chordal graphs which have no induced subgraphs isomorphic to a k-sun for any .

The k-th power of a graph G for , denoted by 
, is the graph on the same vertex set of G where  in 
 if and only if there is a path of length at most k from u to v in G. In particular, 
. If G is a tree, then 
 is a chordal graph for any .

Finally, we observe the following.

Observation 1

If , then .

Proof

Color all vertices of G by color 1. It suffices to note that between any two vertices, there is a shortest path with at most one internal vertex. □

3. Permutation graphs
In this section, we consider rainbow colorings on permutation graphs. Let G be a permutation graph. Let 
 and 
 be two parallel lines in the plane and for each 
, let 
 be the segment associated to v in the intersection model (see Fig. 1). We denote by  the extreme of 
 in 
, that is 
, and we refer to  as the top end point of 
. By  we denote the extreme of 
 in 
, the bottom end point of 
. Throughout, we assume that an intersection model is given; otherwise, one can be computed in linear time [16].

Whenever we write “u intersects v” for two vertices u and v, we mean 
 intersects 
. For two vertices u and v, with , there are several options for  in the intersection model. If We use the notation  if  and . Notice that ‘≺’ is a partial ordering on the vertices of the graph, in particular,  does not imply that .

For each pair , Mondal et al. [17] define two -paths, one of which is shortest. Define a path 
 as follows. If , 
 will be . Otherwise, assume without loss of generality that . Start with 
. Of all vertices x that intersect u with , let 
 be the one with largest 
. If there is no vertex x that intersects u with , we say that the path 
 does not exist. Otherwise, define 
, with , as follows. If 
 is incident to v, set 
 and end the path. Otherwise, if i is even (resp. odd), let 
 be the vertex that intersects 
 where 
 (resp. 
) is largest. Notice that it cannot be that 
, or G would not be connected.

Analogously, we define the path 
. This path starts with 
. If u intersects v, set 
 and end the path. Otherwise, let 
 be the vertex that intersects u with largest 
, if 
 (otherwise the path 
 does not exist). If 
 intersects v, set 
 and end the path. Otherwise, the next vertex 
 is the vertex that intersects 
 with largest 
 (resp. 
) if i is even (resp. odd). Notice that it cannot be that 
, or G would not be connected.

The paths we just defined satisfy the following property. Let 
 be a path. For all ,(1)
(2)
 or, for all ,(3)
(4)
 Note that Equations (1) and (2) hold for 
, by definition, and that Equations (3) and (4) hold for 
, by definition. We now state the following result about the paths 
 and 
. For a proof of it, see Mondal et al. [17, Lemma 5], or see Appendix A.

Lemma 3.1

Mondal et al. [17]
 or 
 is a shortest -path.

We define two special paths P and Q. For the definition of P, let 
 be the vertex such that 
 is smallest among all vertices of G. For , if i is even (resp. odd), let 
 be the vertex that intersects 
 where 
 (resp. 
) is largest. Let P denote the resulting path and let 
 denote the last vertex of P. Observe that 
.

For the definition of Q, let 
 be the vertex such that 
 is smallest among all vertices of G. For , if i is even (resp. odd), let 
 be the vertex that intersects 
 where 
 (resp. 
) is largest. Let Q denote the resulting path and let 
 denote the last vertex of Q. Observe that 
.

Corollary 3.2

P is a shortest 
-path and Q is a shortest 
-path.

Proof

By Lemma 3.1, it follows that 
 or 
 is a shortest 
-path. We claim that 
 does not exist. Assume the contrary and let 
 be the vertex that follows 
 on 
. Then 
 by the definition and existence of 
. Since 
 intersects 
, it follows that 
. But this contradicts the definition of 
. Hence, 
 does not exist. Therefore, 
 is a shortest 
-path. Analogously, we can prove that Q is a shortest 
-path. □

We will prove some more useful properties about the paths P and Q, before we show the rainbow coloring.

Lemma 3.3

Let 
, resp. 
, be the segment that has the rightmost top, resp. bottom, end point. Then 
 and 
 if d is even, and vice versa if d is odd. Furthermore, we have 
 and 
 if 
 is even, and vice versa if 
 is odd.

Proof

Suppose that 
. Since the top of 
 is rightmost, we see that d is even. Then, by definition of P, it holds that the segment, of all segments that intersect 
, that ends rightmost at the bottom equals 
. So, 
.

Suppose that 
 and 
. It is clear that 
, thus 
. If d is even, then 
. But 
 is the vertex that intersects 
 which has the rightmost top end, yielding a contradiction with the fact that 
. So d is odd. Since the path ends at 
, it follows that the vertex that intersects 
 that has the rightmost top is 
. Hence 
. By definition, 
 is the vertex that intersects 
 that has the rightmost bottom. Thus 
.

Suppose that 
 and 
. It holds that 
 is left of 
. Assume that d is even. Consider the shortest 
-path. We know that either 
 or 
 is a shortest path. (See Fig. 2.) Suppose that 
 is the shortest. We know that 
 and 
. It follows that 
 intersects 
. This yields a contradiction with the choice of 
. Suppose that 
 is the shortest path. By the definitions of 
 and P, it holds that 
. Then 
, so 
 is not a shortest path. We conclude that either 
 or 
. The case for d odd is analogous.

 or 
 is a shortest path.

The proof for Q is analogous. □

Lemma 3.4

The sets 
 and 
 are dominating sets of G.

Proof

Suppose that 
 is not a dominating set, and let v be a vertex that is not dominated. We prove with induction that v is right of 
 for all .

It is clear that 
, since 
 and 
. Suppose that 
, for some k. Suppose that k is even. We use the induction hypothesis and Equation (1), to see that 
. Since 
, it follows that 
. Suppose that k is odd. Then 
, by the induction hypothesis and Equation (2). Since 
, it follows that 
.

By Lemma 3.3, we know that 
 or 
. In both cases, there is no vertex v with 
. This yields a contradiction, thus 
 is a dominating set.

The proof for 
 is analogous. □

Lemma 3.5

It holds that  or , and 
 or 
.

Proof

Since P is a shortest path (by Corollary 3.2), we have that . Or, equivalently .

Let u and v be two vertices. Since the set 
 is a dominating set (see Lemma 3.4), there are 
 such that 
, 
. Without loss of generality, we assume that . Then the path 
 has length at most d. Thus .

The proof for 
 is analogous. □

Now we start a breadth-first search from 
. Let 
 be the obtained layers. Since P is a shortest path, it follows that 
 for every i. Thus . Since 
 is a dominating set, we conclude that , thus the layers of the breadth-first search are 
. We also start a breadth-first search in 
, and call the layers 
. Again, we have that 
 for every i. A nice property of the path P is that every vertex 
 is adjacent to all vertices in the next layer 
. An analogous property holds for 
 and 
.

Lemma 3.6

For every i, it holds that 
 and 
.

Proof

We will prove a somewhat stronger result, namely that 
 and if i is even (resp. odd) we have that for every u in 
:(5)

We use a proof by induction. The first layer 
 contains only 
. It is clear that every vertex in the second layer 
 is a neighbor of 
. Moreover, by the definition of 
, we have that 
 for all 
, and thus 
.

Suppose that 
 and Equation (5) holds for every . Let v be a vertex in 
. We know that v does not intersect 
, otherwise v would be contained in 
. So we know that 
 and 
. Since v is in layer 
, v intersects u for some 
 (see Fig. 3). So we either have that  and  or we have  and . If k is even (resp. odd), we have  and  (resp.  and ), otherwise, by the induction hypothesis, v would intersect 
. By the induction hypothesis u intersects 
, so by the definition of 
, we have that 
 (resp. 
). It follows that 
 (resp. 
). We know that 
 (resp. 
), thus 
 (resp. 
). We conclude that v intersects 
, and 
 and 
 (resp. 
 and 
).

So 
 for every k. The proof that 
 is analogous. □

Lemma 3.7

If  or 
, then .

Proof

Assume that . Consider the following coloring (see Fig. 4): 
 

This coloring uses  colors. We claim that it is a rainbow coloring. Let u and v be two vertices. Then 
, 
 for some . Without loss of generality, assume that . If 
, then, by Lemma 3.6, the path 
 is a rainbow path. If , again by Lemma 3.6, the path 
 is a rainbow path.

We conclude that . The proof for 
 is analogous. □

Consider the case where 
. In this case, we will still color the layers of a breadth-first search that starts at 
, but we have to reuse the color of the first layer for layer 
. We consider the coloring:
  We will show that this is a rainbow coloring. For almost every u and v, we readily construct a rainbow path.

Lemma 3.8

For the following u and v, there exists a rainbow path:

 is a rainbow path. Else, the path 
 is a rainbow path.

2.
Without loss of generality, we assume that . By Lemma 3.6, we know that

. Consider the path

There are some vertices u and v, for which we did not yet construct a rainbow path. The case that is left, is the following:

The path via P, 
, does not suffice in this case, because it uses 
 and 
, which are both colored with color 1. So this is not a rainbow path. For some cases we will show that a similar path via Q is a rainbow path. For other cases, we can use the shortest -path, that is, 
 or

Lemma 3.9

If

Proof

Since

Theorem 3.16

=Theorem A
For every n-vertex permutation graph G, it holds that . Moreover, we can compute an optimal rainbow vertex coloring in

By Lemma 3.5 we know that either  or , and either

Assume that we are given a permutation model of the graph and thus know the values  and  for each vertex . Otherwise, a permutation model can be computed in linear time [16]. First, compute d and 
. Following the description of P and Q, this takes linear time. Computing the diameter of G takes 
 time using the algorithm of Mondal et al. [17]. The colorings given by Lemma 3.7 and before Lemma 3.8 can each be computed in linear time through a breadth-first search. By the preceding arguments, an optimal rainbow vertex coloring can be computed in 
 time. □

4. Split strongly chordal graphs
In this section, we show that RVC and SRVC are polynomial-time solvable on split strongly chordal graphs. We show that this result is tight in the sense that both problems are NP-complete on split graphs if we forbid any finite family of suns.

In order to prove our next theorem we will use the following property of dually chordal graphs, a graph class that contains that of strongly chordal graphs [1].

Lemma 4.1

Brandstädt et al. [1]
A graph G is dually chordal if and only if G has a spanning tree T such that every maximal clique of G induces a subtree of T.

We prove a tree with a stronger property exists in split strongly chordal graphs.

Lemma 4.2

Let  be a connected split strongly chordal graph, with , where K is a clique and S is an independent set. Then G has a spanning tree T such that every maximal clique of G induces a subtree of T and every vertex of S is a leaf of T.

Proof

Since G is a strongly chordal graph (and thus a dually chordal graph [1]), by Lemma 4.1, G has a spanning tree 
 such that the vertices of every maximal clique of G induce a subtree of 
. We observe the following simple property.

We will now modify 
 in order to obtain another spanning tree of G that has the same property and, additionally, is such that every vertex of S is a leaf.

Tree Modification. Let  be such that x is not a leaf of 
. Let  be two neighbors of x in 
. Then

(i)
add the edge uv to 
;

(ii)
delete the edge vx from 
.

Observe that the result from this operation is still a tree and it is still spanning.

Claim 1

Let 
 be the tree obtained after the application of the Tree Modification to 
. Then the following holds:

1.
;

2.
Every maximal clique of G induces a subtree of 
.

Proof

It is easy to see that 1. holds, since the edge vx was deleted in step (ii) and no other edge incident to x was added. To see that 2. also holds note that since u is adjacent to both v and x and since  is a clique, every maximal clique D of G that contains v and x also contains u. Since 
, the vertices of D still induce a connected subgraph of 
. ⌟

We now iteratively apply Tree modification to 
 on non-leaf vertices of S. Indeed, if  is not a leaf of 
, then it has at least two neighbors in 
. Since 
 is a spanning tree, any neighbors of x in 
 must be adjacent to x in G, and thus are in K. Hence, Tree Modification can be applied. By Claim 1, we can safely apply Tree Modification repeatedly to 
 until we obtain a tree T in which all the vertices of S have degree 1 in T. □

Theorem 4.3

=Theorem B
If G is a split strongly chordal graph with ℓ cut vertices, then .

Proof

Let  be a split strongly chordal graph, with , where K is a clique and S is an independent set. Note that if , we can (strong) rainbow color G by assigning the same color to all the vertices. Notice that in this case G has at most one cut vertex, thus .

Assume then that  (recall that if G is a split graph, then ). By Lemma 4.2, G has a spanning tree T such that every maximal clique of G induces a subtree of T and every vertex of S is a leaf of T. Let  denote the subtree of T induced by the vertices of K, that is, the subtree of T obtained by the deletion of the leaves corresponding to vertices of S. Note that  is a tree with 
. We will now use the tree  to provide a (strong) rainbow coloring of G.

Claim 2

For every ,  induces a subtree of .

Proof

Since  is a maximal clique of G, the vertices of  induce a subtree of T. Since x is a leaf of T, we conclude that  indeed induces a subtree of . ⌟

Suppose first that G is 2-connected, that is, that no vertex of S has degree one in G.

Claim 3

If G is 2-connected, then .

Proof

Note that . Color the vertices of K according to a proper 2-coloring of the vertices of , and give arbitrary colors to the vertices of S. Let ϕ be the coloring of G obtained in this way. Note that ϕ is indeed a (strong) rainbow coloring of G. To see this, let  be such that 
. Since G is a split graph, we have that . Since G is 2-connected,  and . Moreover, since  and  induce subtrees of , we know that these two sets are not monochromatic under ϕ. Thus, there exist  and  such that , which shows that  is a rainbow (shortest) path between u and v. ⌟

We now consider the case in which G has cut vertices. Let  be the set of cut vertices of G. Consider a proper 2-coloring ϕ of . If there exist 
 such that 
, then we can obtain a (strong) rainbow coloring for G with ℓ colors by assigning distinct colors in the set  to the remaining cut vertices of G. Note that with this coloring of , it holds that for every , if , then  is not monochromatic under ϕ. Since all the cut vertices were assigned distinct colors, by the same argument used in the 2-connected case, this is indeed a (strong) rainbow coloring of G. Note that this reasoning also applies if , so from now on we may assume .

If all the vertices of C were assigned the same color, since ϕ was a proper 2-coloring of , we have that for every , 
. Let 
 be two cut vertices such that the unique path connecting 
 and 
 in  contains no other vertex of C. Let z be the vertex adjacent to 
 in this path. Note that . We will consider the following coloring 
 of . Let 
. Now we extend 
 by considering a proper 2-coloring of the subtree of  rooted in 
 (resp. z) that assigns color 1 to the vertex 
 (resp. z). Note that now we have 
. Finally, assign distinct colors from  to the vertices of 
. To obtain a (strong) rainbow coloring of G with ℓ colors, we color the vertices of K according to 
 and give arbitrary colors to the vertices of S.

Claim 4

 is a (strong) rainbow coloring of G.

Proof

Note that, under this coloring, if there exists  such that  and  is monochromatic under 
, then 
. To see that this is indeed a (strong) rainbow coloring of G, let  be such that 
. If , the unique shortest path between u and v is a rainbow path, since all cut vertices of G received distinct colors. Assume . Recall that if there exists  such that  and  is monochromatic under 
, then 
. Moreover, since 
, we have . If , then at most one among  and  is monochromatic. Thus there exists  and  such that 
, and hence  is a rainbow (shortest) path between u and v. To conclude, consider the case in which . Recall that 
 is the only cut vertex such that 
. Therefore, if 
, then  is not monochromatic, which implies that we can find a vertex  such that 
. Finally, if  with 
, then we can again find  such that 
, since 
, 
 and any monochromatic subtree of  induced by the open neighborhood of a vertex of S is of the form 
. ⌟

Since 
 uses ℓ colors, this concludes the proof. □
We now show that both RVC and SRVC are NP-complete if we only forbid a finite number of suns. In what follows, we make use of the same reduction of Heggernes et al. [8] for split graphs. Their reduction is from Hypergraph Coloring. Given a hypergraph , where 
, they construct a split graph 
, where 
 with

 with

In our case, we start with an instance of Graph Coloring restricted to 
-free graphs, a problem that was shown to be NP-complete by Král' et al. [9] (see also [7]) for every fixed . We can see an input  of Graph Coloring as a hypergraph in which every hyperedge has size two. We perform the same construction and obtain a graph 
. The fact that 
 is a yes-instance to RVC (and SRVC) if and only if G is a yes-instance to Graph Coloring follows from [8, Lemma 11]. We now show that 
 is a split graph with no induced t-sun, with .

Lemma 4.4

-free graph.

Proof

Let  be the 
-free graph that originated

 and independent set 
. Suppose

, where

 for  and 
 is adjacent to

. Since every vertex of

 is a clique, we necessarily have that 
 and 
. Moreover, note that, by construction, for every j, 
. Hence, there exists  such that 
 and 
. For simplicity assume 
. Since

 for , we have that 
 for . Analogously, it holds that 
 as well. This implies that 
 is a cycle in G and therefore G contains an induced cycle of length at most t. This is a contradiction since  and G is 
-free. □

From Lemma 4.4 and Lemma 11 of [8], we obtain the following theorem.

Theorem 4.5

For any fixed , RVC and SRVC are NP-complete on split 
-free graphs for any fixed .

5. Powers of trees
In this section we study powers of trees. Let T be a tree, and z in the center of T. Let  be an edge that is incident to z, with v not in the center. When e is removed from the tree, the tree will fall apart in two parts, a branch is the part that does not contain z. If the center of T contains only one vertex, the number of branches equals the degree of z. We distinguish between squares and higher powers of trees.

5.1. Squares of trees
Two trivial lower bounds for the rainbow vertex connection number of a graph G are the number of cut vertices in G and . In squares of trees we found graphs that need more than 
 colors. Notice that squares of trees are 2-connected, so there are no cut vertices.

Lemma 5.1

Let T be a tree such that the center of T consists of a single vertex z, T has diameter at least 6, and there are at least three branches from the center with maximum length. Then 
.

Proof

Let 
, 
, and 
 be three vertices with maximum distance to z in three different branches. We consider the case that 
 is odd. There is a unique shortest path 
 from 
 to 
 in 
. Analogously, there is a unique shortest path 
 from 
 to 
 in 
. Notice that 
, 
, …, 
, where 
 
. That is, P and Q use the same vertices in the branch of 
. The unique shortest path R in 
 from 
 to 
 is 
. See Fig. 9.

Fig. 9. A graph T for which T2 needs diam(T2) colors, see Lemma 5.1.

We give a proof by contradiction. Let c be a rainbow vertex coloring that uses at most 
 colors. Notice that the paths P, Q, and R have length 
. Therefore, for each of these paths, all internal vertices are assigned different colors and all colors appear in the path. Since the first j vertices of the paths P and Q are equal, we see that the colors used for 
 are the same as the colors used for 
. Since , 
 and 
 are non-empty. Hence, there is a color that appears twice in R, which yields a contradiction. We conclude that 
.

The case that 
 is even is analogous. □

The class of graphs described in the statement of Lemma 5.1 needs exactly 
 colors. We define layer i as the set of all vertices with distance  to the center of T. For a vertex v, we write  for the layer that it is contained in, so , where d is the distance of v to the center of T.

Lemma 5.2

Let T be a tree such that the center of T consists of a single vertex, T has diameter at least 6, and there are at least three branches from the center with maximum length. Then 
.

Proof

Consider the following coloring c: 
 
  Notice that the number of colors in this coloring is 
 
.

We claim that this is a rainbow coloring. Let u and v be two vertices in 
. Let w be the lowest common ancestor of u and v. Consider the following -path: use the even layers to go from u to w, and the odd layers to go from w to v. See Fig. 10. Notice that the internal vertices of such a path are in different layers, hence this is a rainbow path.

Combining this with Lemma 5.1, we conclude that 
. □

Notice that this is not a strong rainbow vertex coloring, since the -path described in the proof is not necessarily a shortest path.

In squares of trees this is the only example that needs more than 
 colors. If a tree T has , then 
 and thus 
 by Observation 1. We distinguish two cases for the remaining trees.

Lemma 5.3

Let T be a tree such that the center of T consists of a single vertex, T has diameter at least 6, and there are exactly two branches from the center with maximum length. Then 
.

Proof

Let 
 be one of the branches with maximum length. Let 
 be all other branches, together with the center vertex. Suppose that 
 is odd. Consider the following coloring c:
 
 
  Intuitively, we color 
 per layer, and we color 
 similarly, but with the colors of layer 1 and 2 swapped, and the colors of layers 3 and 4 swapped, etc. See Fig. 11. The number of colors used in this coloring equals 
.

Let u and v be two vertices of T. We claim that there exists a rainbow path between u and v. If u and v are both in 
, for , we can use the same path as in the proof of Lemma 5.2. Suppose without loss of generality that  and let w be the lowest common ancestor of u and v. Use the even layers to go from u to w, and the odd layers to go from w to v. Notice that every layer has a unique color, except for the center vertex, which has the same color as layer 1 in 
 and as layer 2 in 
. When this path contains the center vertex, both u and v are in 
. Because this path does not contain a vertex in layer 1 as an internal vertex, this is a rainbow path.

If 
 and 
, with , consider the following path. Let 
 be the path from u taking the even layers towards the center, as far as possible, so 
 ends at a neighbor of the center. Let 
 be the same from v. Then the path 
 followed by 
 reversed, is a path from u to v. This is a rainbow path since the colors used in the even layers of 
 are exactly the colors of the odd layers of 
 and vice versa. We conclude that c is a rainbow coloring.

Suppose that 
 is even. We slightly modify the coloring c:
 
 
  The paths constructed above are rainbow paths in this coloring as well. □

Again, this is not a strong rainbow coloring.

Lemma 5.4

Let T be a tree such that the center of T consists of two vertices and T has diameter at least 5. Then 
.

Proof

We will color per layer: 
 
 

The number of colors used in this coloring equals 
 
.

We claim that this is a rainbow coloring. Let u and v be two vertices of T. Write 
 and 
 for the two center vertices. If u and v are both in a branch of 
, for , we can use the same path as in the proof of Lemma 5.2: Let w be the lowest common ancestor of u and v. Use the even layers to go from u to w, and the odd layers to go from w to v. Since we use at most one vertex per layer, this is a rainbow path.

Otherwise, assume without loss of generality that u is in a branch of 
 and v in a branch of 
. Use the even layers to go from u to 
, and the odd layers to go from 
 to v. Again, this is a rainbow path. See Fig. 12. □

5.2. Higher powers of trees
In this section we consider higher powers 
 for . We will see that the same results hold for the higher powers, but we have to distinguish more cases. Specifically, for the cases where the center consists of a single vertex, we have to consider whether  or not. For squares of trees we did not consider the case that , since the diameter is always even if the center consists of a single vertex.

Lemma 5.5

Let T be a tree such that the center of T consists of a single vertex, T has diameter at least 3k, , and there are at least three branches from the center with maximum length. Then 
.

Proof

This proof is analogous to the proof of Lemma 5.1. □

As for squares of trees, we can prove that 
 many colors suffice in this case.

Lemma 5.6

Let T be a tree such that the center of T consists of a single vertex, T has diameter at least 3k, , and there are at least three branches from the center with maximum length. Then 
.

Proof

To describe a rainbow coloring with 
 colors, we need to count the layers bottom-up. That is, we start counting the layers at the vertices that are furthest from the center. Recall that  is the number of the layer that contains v.

Consider the following coloring c:
 
  We will count the number of colors we used. We have one color for every layer i with , or  minus layer 0 and the layer with the center vertex, and one extra color 1 for the rest of the vertices. There are 
 
 layers excluding the center vertex. Divide the layers 
 
 into blocks of size k (the topmost block does not need to be a complete block). The vertices in layers  are exactly the topmost vertices of the complete blocks, and the vertices in layers  are exactly the lowest vertices in the blocks. The number of complete blocks is 
 
, thus the number of layers that is , is 
 
. The total number of blocks is 
 
, so the number of layers that is , minus layer 0, is 
 
. Thus the total number of colors used in this coloring is
 
 
 
 

We claim that this is a rainbow coloring. Let u and v be two vertices in 
. Let w be the lowest common ancestor of u and v. Consider the following -path: use the layers that are  to go from u to w, and the layers that are  to go from w to v. See Fig. 13.

Fig. 13. A tree T. Let k = 6. The numbers indicate the coloring of T6, all unlabeled vertices have color 1. The gray square vertices are a rainbow path in T6 from u to v. See Lemma 5.6.

Notice that the internal vertices of such a path are in different layers, all of which are 0 or , except for vertex w. Hence this is a rainbow path.

Combining this with Lemma 5.5, we conclude that 
. □

As in the case of squares of trees, these are the only powers of trees with 
. For all other powers of trees it holds that 
. If , then 
, so then one color suffices.

Lemma 5.7

Let T be a tree such that the center of T consists of a single vertex, T has diameter at least , and . Then 
.

Proof

We will start with a partial coloring of the vertices, almost the same coloring as in the proof of Lemma 5.6:
 

We colored every layer that is 0 or , excluding layer 0 and the center vertex, with a unique color, see Fig. 14. The idea to obtain a rainbow path from a vertex u to a vertex v will be, as in Lemma 5.6, that we walk from u to the lowest common ancestor w using the layer  and then from w to v via the layer . This time, since we want to use only 
 colors, we have to be careful about the color that we assign to the lowest common ancestor w.

Fig. 14. Trees T, k = 5. The numbers indicate the partial coloring of Tk, as in Lemma 5.7.

First, we count the number of colors we used so far. The number of layers l excluding 0 and the center is 
 
. We will divide those layers in blocks of size k, starting at layer 1 (the topmost block does not need to be a complete block). Notice that the top two layers in every complete block are colored. There are 
 
 complete blocks, so 
 
 colors for those blocks. If the topmost block is not a complete block, it uses a color only if it has size . But then the center vertex is in a layer , which implies that , a contradiction with the assumptions. We conclude that the number of colors used is 
 
.

We distinguish cases for the coloring of the rest of the vertices. Let z be the center vertex, and let 
 and 
 be two longest branches from z. Define 
 as a vertex in 
 in the highest layer  that is colored and 
 as a vertex in 
 in the highest layer  that is colored. Recall that 
 denotes the distance between 
 and 
 in T.

Suppose that 
. We claim that 
 
. Let 
, 
 be vertices in layer 0. A -path contains a vertex in every complete block in 
, a vertex in every complete block in 
 and a vertex in a topmost incomplete block or z. All in all, these are 
 
 internal vertices. So 
 
. It follows that we can use one more color in our coloring c. Use this extra color for all uncolored vertices. Then, for any two vertices , the path described before is a rainbow path: use the  layers to go from u to z and the  layers to go from z to v.

Now suppose that 
. It follows that k divides , a contradiction with the assumptions of the lemma.

Now suppose that 
. Color all uncolored vertices with the highest color used, that is, color ki where 
 
. Let u and v be two vertices. We distinguish two cases.

If the lowest common ancestor w is in layer ki or lower, we use the same path described above: use the  layers to go from u to w and the  layers to go from w to v. Because w is in layer ki or lower, no vertex of layer ki is used as internal vertex of the  and -paths. So the color of w is unique in the path, and this is a rainbow path.

If w is above layer ki, then we use the same path but exclude vertex w. Let 
 be the last internal vertex of the -path, and 
 be the first internal vertex of the -path. Notice that 
 is in layer ki and 
 is in layer . As 
, the distance between 
 and 
 is at most k, so there exists an edge 
 in 
. We conclude that the path using the  vertices to go from u to 
 combined with the path using the  vertices to go from 
 to v is a rainbow path in 
. □

Lemma 5.8

Let T be a tree such that the center of T consists of a single vertex, T has diameter at least 3k, , and there are exactly two branches from the center with maximum length. Then 
.

Proof

To prove this, we will combine the ideas of Lemma 5.3, Lemma 5.7. Let 
 and 
 be the branches with maximum length. Let 
 be all other branches. Suppose that 
 is even. Consider the following coloring c, see Fig. 15:

Fig. 15. A tree T. The numbers indicate a rainbow coloring of Tk, for k = 5, the unlabeled vertices have color 1. See Lemma 5.8.

First, we count the number of colors we used. We used the colors ki and  for . These are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 colors. Here, the third line holds since we assumed that 
 is even. We used one extra color for the rest of the vertices, which makes a total of 
 colors.

Let u and v be two vertices of T. We claim that there exists a rainbow path between u and v in 
. We will distinguish several cases.

Suppose that 
, 
. Let z be the center of the graph. Use the layers , to walk from u to z, and the layers , to go from z to v. This is a rainbow path.

Suppose that 
, 
, . Let w be the lowest common ancestor of u and v. Use the layers  to go from u to w, and the layers  to go from w to v. This is a rainbow path.

Suppose that 
, 
, . Let w be the lowest common ancestor of u and v. Use the layers  to walk from u to w, and the layers  to go from w to v. This is a rainbow path.

Now suppose that 
 is odd. We slightly change the coloring: use color ki with 
 
 for the case ‘otherwise’ instead of color 1. Notice that this is the highest color used in the rest of the coloring. The number of colors used is:
 
 
 
 
 
 

We can use almost the same paths as in the case of 
 being even.

Suppose that 
, 
. Let z be the center of the graph. Let P be the path from u to z that uses the layers , and Q the path from z to v that uses the layers . Let 
 be the last vertex before z in P and let 
 be the first vertex after z in Q. Notice that z has the same color as 
, so we cannot include both z and 
 in a rainbow path. Notice that both 
 and 
 are in the highest layer ki. Since the diameter  and 
 is odd, it follows that the distance between 
 and 
 in T is exactly k. Thus there is an edge 
 in 
. Combine the paths P and Q but exclude vertex z, to obtain a path from u to v. This is a rainbow path.

Consider the other two cases. That is, suppose that 
, 
,  or 
, 
, . Let w be the lowest common ancestor of u and v. If w is in layer i with 
 
, then use the same path as in the case 
 even. If w is in layer i with 
 
, then w has the same color as its predecessor 
 or successor 
 in the path described in the case 
 even. As in the previous case, the distance between 
 and 
 in T is at most k, so there exists an edge 
 in 
. So if we exclude w from the path described in the case 
 even, we still have a path, and this is a rainbow path. □

Lemma 5.9

Let T be a tree such that the center of T consists of two vertices and T has diameter at least . Then 
.

Proof

Let 
 and 
 be the two center vertices. Let 
 be all branches of 
, including 
, and 
 be all branches of 
, including 
.

Divide the layers 
 
 in blocks of size k, starting at layer 1 (the topmost block does not need to be a complete block). Let l be the number of complete blocks in 
. Let 
 be the topmost vertices in the topmost complete blocks in 
 (possibly 
), that is, 
 are all vertices in 
 in layer kl. Analogously, let 
 be the topmost vertices in the topmost complete blocks in 
 (possibly 
), that is, 
 are all vertices in 
 in layer kl. We will distinguish two cases.

First, suppose that 
. Consider the following partial coloring, see Fig. 16:
  Color the rest of the vertices with the highest color used in the partial coloring, that is, with color kl.

Fig. 16. Trees T, k = 5. The numbers indicate the coloring of Tk. See Lemma 5.9.

Notice that the partial coloring colors the top two vertices of every complete block, so the number of colors we used equals 2l. Let u be a vertex in layer 0 in 
 and v a vertex in layer 0 in 
. Notice that a shortest path from u to v uses at least one vertex from every complete block. It follows that 
. So we conclude that the number of colors we used is at most 
.

We show that this coloring is a rainbow coloring. Let 
 and 
 be two vertices in different sets of branches. Consider the path P from u to its ancestor 
 using the layers that are , and the path Q from the ancestor 
 of v to v using the layers that are . Since 
, there exists an edge 
 in 
. Hence we can combine P and Q to a path from u to v. This is a rainbow path.

Let u and v be two vertices in the same set of branches, so u and v are both in 
 or both in 
. Let w be their lowest common ancestor, and let i be the layer that contains w. If , then consider the path P from u to w using the layer  and the path Q from w to v using the layers . Combining them yields a rainbow path from u to v. Suppose that . Notice that we cannot simply use the path PQ, since w has the same color as the vertices in layer kl or  (depending on whether u and v are in 
 or 
). Let P and Q be as before and let 
 be the last vertex before w in P and 
 the first vertex after w in Q. Notice that 
 is in layer kl and 
 is in layer . Then 
, hence there is an edge 
 in 
. So combining P and Q but excluding vertex w is a path from u to v, and it is a rainbow path.

Second, suppose that 
. Consider the following coloring, see Fig. 16:
  The number of colors we used in this coloring is . The diameter of this graph is also : for a vertex u in layer 0 of 
 and v in layer 0 of 
, a shortest path needs at least one vertex from every complete block and a vertex from the topmost (incomplete) blocks. Such a path has length at least . So the number of colors we used is at most 
.

We will show that this is a rainbow coloring. For vertices 
 and 
, we use the following path: from u to 
 using the layers  and from 
 to v using the layers . For two vertices u and v in the same set of branches, so both in 
 or both in 
, use the layers  to go from u to the lowest common ancestor w and the layers  to go from w to v. Those paths are rainbow paths. □

Theorem 5.10

=Theorem C
If G is a power of a tree, then , and the corresponding optimal rainbow vertex coloring can be found in time that is linear in the size of G.

Proof

In Lemma 5.2, Lemma 5.3, Lemma 5.4, Lemma 5.6, Lemma 5.7, Lemma 5.8, Lemma 5.9, it is shown that . Suppose that 
. If the tree T is unknown, it can be computed in linear time [2]. First, we compute the center of T, and then we distinguish cases as in Lemma 5.2, Lemma 5.3, Lemma 5.4, Lemma 5.6, Lemma 5.7, Lemma 5.8, Lemma 5.9. This costs linear time. In each of those lemmas, an optimal coloring is given that can be computed in linear time. □

6. Conclusion and open problems
In this work, we provided polynomial-time algorithms to obtain rainbow vertex colorings of permutation graphs, powers of trees, and split strongly chordal graphs. The algorithm provided for split strongly chordal graphs also works for the strong variant of the problem, where the rainbow paths connecting pairs of vertices are required to be also shortest paths.

An interesting question to be answered towards solving Conjecture 1.1 is whether RVC can be solved in polynomial time on AT-free graphs, i.e. graphs that do not contain an asteroidal triple. Conjecture 1.1 has been proved true for interval graphs [8] and, in this work, for permutation graphs, both of which are important subclasses of AT-free graphs.

Another direction of research within graph classes lies in determining the complexity of RVC and SRVC on strongly chordal graphs. Note that both powers of trees and split strongly chordal graphs form subclasses of strongly chordal graphs for which RVC is polynomial-time solvable, as we show in this work. Finally, note that every strongly chordal graph is also a chordal graph, and the problems are known to be NP-hard when restricted to chordal graphs.
