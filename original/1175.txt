Abstract
We present a family of avoidable formulas with reversal whose avoidability index is unbounded. We also complete the determination of the avoidability index of the formulas with reversal in the 3-avoidance basis.

1. Introduction
The notion of formula with reversal [3], [4] is an extension of the notion of classical formula such that a variable x can appear both as x and 
 with the convention that in an occurrence h of the formula, 
 is the reverse (i.e., mirror image) of . For example, the word  contains the occurrence  of the formula 
 because , 
, 
 are all factors of w. The avoidability index  of a formula with reversal F is the minimum number of letters contained in an infinite word avoiding F.

Currie, Mol, and Rampersad [3] have asked if there exist formulas with reversal with arbitrarily large avoidability index. They considered the formula 
 and obtained that 
, 
, 
, 
, 
 if  and , and 
 if  and . They conjecture that 
 for all . Computational experiments suggest that the upper bound 
 for  is witnessed by the image of every 
 
-free ternary word under the following -uniform morphism where , , and . 
  We do not try to prove that such words actually avoid 
. Instead, we give a positive answer to their original question with Theorem 1 below. Consider the formula 
. That is, 
, 
, 
, …

Theorem 1

For every fixed b, there exists k such that 
.

This result contrasts with the situation of classical formulas (without reversal). Clark [1] has shown in 2001 that there exist formulas with index 5 (such as ), but no avoidable classical formula with higher index is currently known.

Currie, Mol, and Rampersad [4] have also determined the 3-avoidance basis for formulas with reversal, which contains the minimally avoidable formulas with reversal on 3 variables. They obtained several bounds on the avoidability index of the formulas with reversal in the 3-avoidance basis. The next two results finish the determination of the avoidability index of these formulas.

Theorem 2

The following formulas are simultaneously 2-avoidable:

•

•

•

•

•

Theorem 3

The formulas 
 and 
 are simultaneously 3-avoidable.

Theorems 1 to 3 are proved in Sections 2 to 4, respectively.

A word w is d-directed if for every factor f of w of length d, the word 
 is not a factor of w.

Remark 4

If a d-directed word contains an occurrence h of 
, then .

In order to express the simultaneous avoidance of similar formulas, as in Theorem 2, Theorem 3, we introduce the notation 
 to represent equality up to mirror image. That is, if , then 
 and 
. For example, avoiding  and 
 simultaneously is equivalent to avoiding 
. Notice that the notion of undirected avoidability recently considered by Currie and Mol [2] corresponds to the case where every occurrence of every variable of the formula is equipped with 
.

Recall that a word is 
-free if it contains no repetition with exponent strictly greater than β and period at least n. Also, a word is 
-free if it is 
-free.

The C code to find and check the morphisms in this paper is available at http://www.lirmm.fr/~ochem/morphisms/reversal.htm.

2. Formulas with unbounded avoidability index
Let us first show that for every , 
 is avoided by the periodic word 
 over  letters. This word is 2-directed, so every occurrence h of 
 is such that 
 for every  by Remark 4. Without loss of generality, 
. This forces 
, 
, and so on until 
 and 
, which contradicts 
. Thus 
.

Let b be an integer and let w be an infinite word on at most b letters. Consider the Rauzy graph R of w such that the vertices of R are the letters of w and for every factor uv of length two in w, we put the arc 
 in R. So R is a directed graph, possibly with loops (circuits of length 1) and digons (circuits of length 2). Since w is infinite, every vertex of R has out-degree at least 1. So R contains a circuit 
 of length i with . Let 
 be the vertices of 
 in cyclic order. Let k be the least common multiple of . Since i divides k, w contains the occurrence h of 
 such that 
 for every . Thus 
.

3. Formulas that flatten to 
Notice that avoiding simultaneously the formulas in Theorem 2 is equivalent to avoiding 
. The fragment 
 is here to exclude the classical formula . Indeed, even though Gamard et al. [5] obtained that , a computer check shows that  and F cannot be avoided simultaneously over two letters, that is, 
 is not 2-avoidable.

We use the method in [6] to show that the image of every 
 
-free word over 
 under the following 21-uniform morphism is 
 
-free. We also check that such a binary word is 11-directed. 
  Consider an occurrence h of F. Since F contains 
, then  by Remark 4. Suppose that . Then 
 is a repetition with period . This implies 
 
 
, which gives 
 
. Since , we deduce 
 
 
. Symmetrically, considering the repetition 
 gives 
 
 
. So
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 and
 
 
 
 Symmetrically, .

In every case, , , and . Thus we can check exhaustively that h does not exist.

4. The formulas 
 and 
Notice that avoiding 
 and 
 simultaneously is equivalent to avoiding 
. We use the method in [6] to show that the image of every 
 
-free word over 
 under the following 9-uniform morphism is 
 
-free. We also check that such a ternary word is 4-directed. 
  Consider an occurrence h of F. Since F contains 
, then  by Remark 4. Suppose that . Then  is a repetition with period . This implies 
 
 
, which gives 
 
. Since , we deduce 
 
 
. Symmetrically, considering the repetition 
 gives 
 
 
. So
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 and
 
 
 
 
 So  and, symmetrically, .

In every case,  and . Thus we can check exhaustively that h does not exist.
