1. Introduction
With rapid development and advances of very large scale integration technology and wafer-scale integration technology, multiprocessor systems have been widely designed and used in our daily life. It is well known that the underlying topology of the multiprocessor systems can be modelled by a connected graph , where  is the set of processors and  is the set of communication links of multiprocessor systems. Denote 
 the set of all 0-1 binary strings of length n. The n-dimensional hypercube, denoted by 
, is the graph in which each vertex is corresponding to a distinct n-digit binary string 
 on the set 
, and edges exist between any pair of vertices differing by a single digit in their binary representation. Since 
 posses many attractive properties, such as recursive structure, regularity, symmetry, small diameter [1], [2], the hypercube structure is a classical interconnection model and has been used widely in modern technology.

As was shown by Hillis [3], the hypercube does not have the smallest possible diameter for its resources. In the past years, several variations of hypercubes have been proposed and investigated to improve the efficiency of hypercube networks, such as folded hypercube [4], hierarchical cubic network [5], balanced hypercube [6], dual cube [7], exchanged hypercube [8], and so on. In 2005, Yang et al. [9] introduced another variation of hypercube, the locally twisted cube 
, whose diameter is only about half of the diameter of 
.

Let 
 and 
 be two binary strings of 
, denote  the (bitwise modulo 2) sum of x and y.

Definition 1

([9]) For , an n-dimensional locally twisted cube, 
, is defined as follows:

(1) 
 is a graph isomorphic to 
;

(2) For , 
 is built from two disjoint copies of 
 according to the following steps: Let 
 denote the graph obtained from one copy of 
 by prefixing the labels of each vertex with 0. Let 
 denote the graph obtained from one copy of 
 by prefixing the labels of each vertex with 1. Connect each vertex 
 of 
 to the vertex 
 of 
 with an edge.

Let  and . Bhuyan and Agrawal [10] proposed the generalized hypercube 
, which is a generalization of the hypercube 
.

Definition 2

([10]) Let  and 
 be integers no less than 2 for each . An n-dimensional generalized hypercube, denoted by 
, is defined as follows:

(1) The vertex set 
 is a collection of all the n-dimensional strings 
, where 
 for each ;

(2) For two vertices x and y in 
, x is adjacent to y if and only if their strings differ at exactly one dimension position.

In the design and analysis of multiprocessor systems (networks), the generalized k-connectivity of the corresponding graph, which was introduced by Chartrand et al. [11], is an essential parameter for measuring reliability and fault tolerance of the network.

Let  be a simple graph, S be a subset of . A tree T in G is called an S-tree, if . The trees 
 are called internally edge disjoint S-trees if 
 and 
 for any integers . 
 denote the maximum number of internally edge disjoint S-trees. For an integer k with , the generalized k-connectivity of G, denoted by 
, is defined as 
.

Over the past few years, research on the generalized connectivity has received meaningful progress. Li et al. [12] derived that it is NP-complete for a general graph G to decide whether there are l internally disjoint trees connecting S, where l is a fixed integer and . Authors in [13], [14] investigated the upper and lower bounds of the generalized connectivity of a general graph G. Many authors have studied exact values of the generalized connectivity of some important classes of graphs, such as, complete graphs [15], complete bipartite graphs [16], Cartesian product graphs [17], [18], Cayley graphs [19], [20], [21], [22], -bubble-sort graphs [23], hypercubes [17], [24], [25], dual cubes [26], and so on.

In this paper, we try to determine the generalized 3-connectivity of two kinds of regular networks, the locally twisted cube 
 and the generalized hypercube 
, and get two main results of this paper as follows.

2. Preliminaries
This section is dedicated to introducing some necessary preliminaries. We only consider a simple, connected graph  with  be its vertex set and  be its edge set. For a vertex , the degree of x in G, denoted by 
, is the number of edges of G incident with x. Denote  the minimum degree of vertices in G. We can abbreviate  to δ if there is no confusion. A graph is d-regular if 
 for every vertex . For a vertex , we use 
 to denote the neighbour vertices set of x.

Let 
, denote by 
 the graph obtained from G by deleting all the vertices in 
 together with their incident edges. Let P be a path in G with x and y be its two terminal vertices, then P is called an -path. Two ()-paths 
 and 
 are internally disjoint if they have no common internal vertices, that is, 
.

Li et al. [14] gave an upper bound of 
 for a general graph G.

 with respect to the operation ‘+’. In [9], the authors introduced the n-dimensional two-twisted cube, 
.

(2) Let

 by suffixing the labels of all vertices with 1.

(3) Connect each vertex x of 
 to the vertex 
 of

Subcase 2.1. 
 or

 in 
. For , let

Moreover, we may construct (
) internally edge disjoint S-trees 
 (
) by similar operations in Subcase 2.1. Then 
, 
 are 
 
 desired S-trees.

Case 3. 
 and 
 are three mutually distinct integers for each .

That means 
 for each . We may divide 
 into 
, 
, ⋯, 
 along the nth dimension. Then  and z belong to different 
s by the above hypothesis. W.l.o.g., assume that 
, 
 and

Subcase 3.1. .

The generalized hypercube 
 is isomorphic to the Cartesian product of

) internally edge disjoint trees 
 can be found. Then 
, 
 are 
 
 desired S-trees in 
.

Subcase 3.2. .

Set 
. Clearly, 
. By the induction hypothesis, there exist t internally edge disjoint 
-trees 
 
 
 in 
. Since , it is easy to get the following claim.

Claim 1

The subgraph induced on 
 is an empty graph.

Let 
 
 
. Moreover, let 
 and 
 be neighbour vertices set of 
 and 
 in H, respectively. By Claim 1, 
 and 
.

According to Lemma 7, 
 is ()-regular, which implies that 
 
 and that 
 
 for every . W.l.o.g., assume that 
 
 for , and assume that 
 is a neighbour vertex of 
 in 
 
.

For , let
 
 if

 in 
 
 and let
 
 if 
 has two neighbour vertices 
 and 
 in 
 
.

Let
 
 
 and
 

Moreover, for 
, (
) internally edge disjoint trees 
 can be found by similar methods in Subcase 2.1. Then 
, 
 are 
 
 desired S-trees.

In all, for any 
, there exist 
 
 internally edge disjoint S-trees in 
. □

It follows from Lemma 8 and Lemma 9 that Theorem 2 holds. Furthermore, one can see that the generalized hypercube 
 is isomorphic to the Cartesian product graph 
. Based on this observation, Corollary 2 follows immediately from Theorem 2.

Corollary 2

5. Conclusion
The generalized k-connectivity is a natural generalization of the traditional connectivity and can serve for measuring the capability of a network G to connect any k vertices in G. In this paper, we focus on the generalized 3-connectivity of the locally twisted cube 
 and the generalized hypercube 
. Table 1 summarizes some parameters of several variations of hypercube. We can see that most of the results on the generalized k-connectivity of networks are about . It would be an interesting and challenging topic to study the generalized k-connectivity of networks for .
