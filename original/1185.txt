Abstract
Let G=(V(G),E(G)) be a simple connected graph. For any two distinct vertices u and v, d(u,v) represents the distance between u and v. Suppose k be any positive integer with 1⩽k⩽diam(G), where the diam(G) represents the diameter of G. A radio k-labeling of G is a mapping f:V(G)→{0,1,2,…} such that |f(u)−f(v)|⩾k+1−d(u,v) for each pair of distinct vertices u and v of G. The absolute difference of the largest and smallest values in f(V(G)) is termed as the span of f, and is denoted by span(f). The antipodal number is the minimum span of a radio (diam(G)−1)-labeling of G and the radio number is the minimum span of a radio diam(G)-labeling of G. In this article we determine the antipodal number of the m-ary tree for any m≥3 with any height h≥3 and construct explicitly an optimal antipodal labeling.

1. Introduction
Frequency Assignment Problem (FAP) in a network is mainly involved in allocation of frequencies to the transmitters, and hence corroborating no interference in the frequencies, in general the close transmitters may not have close frequencies. Hale [8] conceptualized the frequency assignment problem as a generalized graph labeling problem. This labeling problem has several variations depending upon the type of assignment of frequencies to the stations. Radio k-labeling of graphs is one type of such variations (see [1], [2], [6], [8]). Let  be a simple connected graph with diameter d and k be a positive integer such that . A radio k-labeling of G is a function  such that  holds for each pair of distinct vertices u and v of G, where  is the distance between u and v in G. The absolute difference of the largest and smallest values in  is termed as the span of f, and is denoted by . The minimum span amongst all radio k-labellings of G is the radio k-chromatic number of G and it is denoted by 
. The numbers 
 and 
 are known as the radio number and the antipodal number of G, respectively. In literature, the radio number and the antipodal number are also symbolized by  and , respectively. The radio k- labeling problem was first introduced by Chartrand et al. [1], [2] and further studied in [4], [3], [9], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [18], [19], [21], [22], [23], [24].

Determining the radio k-chromatic number of a graph is an interesting yet difficult combinatorial problem with potential applications to FM channel assignment. The radio number of paths and cycles were determined by Liu and Zhu [12]. Chartrand et al. [2] determined the antipodal number of cycles 
 when  and for the other values of n they have determined lower bounds. Later, the antipodal number of cycle 
 was determined by Juan and Liu [9] for , in which an improved bound for  was given. With the help of generalized binary Gray codes the radio number and the antipodal number of any hypercube was studied by Khennoufa and Togni [10]. Ortiz et al. [17] investigated the radio number for generalized prism graphs. For two positive integers  and , the toroidal grids 
 are the Cartesian product 
. Morris et al. [16] determined the radio number of 
, and Saha et al. [20] gave the exact value of 
 when .

Until now the radio k-chromatic number (mainly radio number) of trees have been investigated by several authors. Liu [13] has given a general lower bound for the radio number of trees. We call the trees whose radio numbers achieve this lower bound as lower bound trees. Many families of trees have shown to be the lower bound trees, including complete level-wise regular trees without degree 2 vertices (proved by Halász and Tuza [7]) and complete m-ary trees with  (proved by Li et al. [11]). Recently, this lower bound has been improved by Liu, Saha and Das [15].

Saha et al. [22] investigated the radio k-chromatic number of paths for most values of k. For , the radio k-chromatic number for trees T have been studied by Chavez, Liu and Shurman [3], in which a general lower bound of 
 for trees T and  was presented.

A full m-ary tree 
 () is a rooted tree for which each vertex of degree greater than one has exactly m children and all one degree vertices are of equal distances (height) to the root. For , the antipodal number of 
 was conceived and calculated by Das et al. [5]. Keeping in mind the results of Das et al. [5], in this article we extend and successfully determine the exact value of antipodal number for full m-ary trees 
 when  and . This value is greater than the lower bound presented in [3] mentioned in the above. Rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we discuss some preliminary results on trees. In Section 3, we determine a lower bound of the antipodal number for full m-ary trees 
 with  and . Finally, in Section 4, we have shown that this lower bound is exactly same as the antipodal number of 
 when  and .

2. Preliminaries
The following definitions and notations can be found in [13], [15].

Definition 2.1

Let T be a tree rooted at x, then the weight of T at x is defined by
  The smallest weight among all possible roots of T is called the weight of T and it is denoted by . That is,
 A vertex 
⁎
 of a tree T is called a weight center or centroid of T if 
⁎
.

Definition 2.2

Let T be a tree rooted at a vertex r (fixed). For any two vertices u and v, if u is on the -path, then u is an ancestor of v, and v is a descendent of u. Let 
 be a neighbor of r. A branch of T is a subtree induced by 
 together with all the descendents of 
.

Notation 2.1

Let T be a tree with centroid S. The level of  denoted by , is the distance of u from S (i.e. ). A vertex u of T is in level ℓ if . For distinct , the length of the common part of the paths of T from S to u and v is denoted by .

The following results (Lemma 2.1, Lemma 2.2, Lemma 2.3) can be found in [13] due to Liu.
Lemma 2.1

[13] Let T be a tree rooted at r. Then for distinct  the following  hold.

Lemma 2.2

[13] For an n-vertex tree T, the following are true:

(a)
If v be a centroid of T, then each component of  contains at most 
 
 vertices.

(b)
A tree with odd vertices has exactly one centroid.

Lemma 2.3

[13] Let f be a radio labeling of an n-vertex tree T with vertices u and v with the largest and smallest labels, respectively. Then where  denotes the weight of T and S denotes the centroid of T.

3. Lower bound for the antipodal number of full m-ary trees
In this section, we present a lower bound for the antipodal number of full m-ary trees 
 with . We need the following definitions and lemmas to prove the theorems concerning the lower bounds.

Definition 3.1

An induced subgraph H of a graph G is said to be k-diameteral maximal subgraph if the diameter of H is k and it contains the maximum number of vertices of G.

Definition 3.2

Let  be a mapping from a set E to a set F. For a set , the mapping 
 is called the restriction of f on A.

Lemma 3.1

Let G be a graph with diameter d and H be a k-diameteral subgraph of G with . If 
 and  are the radio k-chromatic number of G and the radio number of H, respectively, then 
.

Proof

Let f be a radio k-labeling of G. As  and the diameter of H is k, so  is a proper subset of . Also note that 
 for any two vertices u and v in H. Let 
 be the restriction of f on . Then 
, which is true for any radio k-labeling of G, including 
. Since the diameter of H is k, we obtain the required result. □

The lemma below gives the number of vertices and the weight for each k-diametral maximal subgraph of 
.
Lemma 3.2

Let 
 be a full m-ary tree of height h. Then for , the following hold:

(a)

(b)
Each k-diameteral maximal subgraph has 
 
 vertices.

(c)
The weight of each k-diameteral maximal subgraph is 
 
 
.

Proof

Let r be the root vertex of 
 and 
 be the m children of r.

(a) Note that the diameter of 
 is 2h. Since the degree of r is m, 
 has m branches and each branch itself is a full m-ary tree of height . Let the components of 
 be 
, where . Then each 
 is identical with 
. Now if we want to get an induced subgraph of 
 with diameter , then we need to delete all the pendant vertices of the  subtrees out of m subtrees 
. There are m ways to choose such type of  subtrees and each choice produces exactly one -diameteral maximal subgraph of 
. Hence we obtain the result.

(b) and (c): Let 
 be the tree obtained from 
 by deleting all the pendant vertices from each 
 with , where . Then 
 is the complete list of -diameteral maximal subgraphs of 
. Observe that 
 and 
, , are identical. Thus for , the number of vertices and weights of 
 are given by

 = 
 = 
 
 and
 
 
 Thus we obtain our result. □

From here onwards, by an optimal antipodal labeling of a tree T, we mean an antipodal labeling f with . The following theorem gives a lower bound for the antipodal number of full m-ary trees 
.

Theorem 3.1

For a full m-ary tree 
 of height h and ,
 

Proof

The diameter of 
 is 2h. Let  and r be the root vertex of 
. Also let 
 be the m children of r. Note that r is the centroid of 
. For each , let us denote the branch of 
 having a centroid at 
 by 
. From Lemma 3.2, 
 has exactly m k-diameteral maximal subgraphs. Let us denote these k-diameteral maximal subgraphs by 
 with centroid 
, where . Then 
 is the tree obtained from 
 by deleting all pendant vertices from each 
 with . Let f be any radio k-labeling of 
 with 
 and 
 as the first and last colored vertices of 
, since f is a radio k-labeling of 
 and 
, the restriction 
 induces a radio labeling of 
 for each t. Thus 
 
. Now applying Lemma 2.3 to each 
 and using the results of Lemma 3.2, we have the following inequalities 
 
 
 
 
 for each i, . Thus 
 
, where 
 
 
.

Let 
. As , the cardinality of the set S is at least 3. Now we determine the least value of  
 
 depending on the position of minimum colored vertex 
 and maximum colored vertex 
. For this we consider the following cases.

Case-I: 
 and 
. As 
, let 
. Select another vertex 
 from 
. Here 
. If 
, then 
. Then for the k-diameteral sub-graph 
, 
. If 
, then as S contain at least 3 elements, so there exist 
 with 
. Thus for the k-diameteral sub-graph 
, 
.

Case-II: 
 and 
. Let 
. Select another vertex 
 from 
. Here 
. As 
, so 
. Thus for the k-diameteral sub-graph 
, 
.

Case-III: 
 or 
. Let 
. Then 
, for . If 
 then 
. Thus for the k-diameteral sub-graph 
, 
. Again if 
, then 
.

Case-IV: 
. If 
, then it is similar to Case-III. If 
, then it is similar to Case-II. Now it remains to prove the result when both 
 and 
 are not in . If 
 then for the k-diameteral sub-graph 
, 
. If 
 then for the k-diameteral sub-graph 
, 
.

On account of these four cases above, we get the result. □

Correctness of Algorithm 1
To prove the mapping f defined in Algorithm 1 is an antipodal labeling we need the following results.

Lemma 4.1

Let 
 and 
 be two vertices obtained in Step-II of Algorithm 1. If

, where 
.

Proof

Let

. So there exist ℓ integers 
 from  such that 
. By the same argument we may write 
, where each 
 is in . Without loss of generality, we may assume . Then 
. Let t be the largest subscript such that

. We must have 
; for otherwise, 
, which is a contradiction. Hence 
. □

Lemma 4.2

Let 
 and

 and

, then .

Proof

Without loss of generality, we assume . Let 
 and 
. Then
 Case 1: both 
 and 
 are not in E. In this case 
 and 
. Using Lemma 4.1, we have 
 which leads us with .

Case 2: both 
 and 
 are in E. Recall that 
 
. We consider the following two subcases.

Sub-case (2a): 
 and 
 are in distinct 
's. Let 
 and 
 with . Then the vertices 
 and 
 are in  and  level, respectively. Here  as . Therefore 
. From Observation 4.1, the values of a and b are given by
 
 
 where
 
 
 
  With these values of A and B in above, we have(2)
 Since 
 for each i, 
 
 
. With this inequality, we have the following lower bounds of  when 
 and

  From (2) with the help of (3), we have

. Thus in this case
 
 
 
 
 
 With this lower value of , the equation (2) gives
 Sub-case (2b): both

 where
 
 
 
  In this case, 
 and

Similarly we may show the result when

 Finally the lemma is proved. □

Lemma 4.3

Let

Case 2: Both
