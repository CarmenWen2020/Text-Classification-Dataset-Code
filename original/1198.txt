Abstract
A t/s-diagnosable system refers to such a system that all the faulty nodes of the system can be isolated within a set of size at most s in the presence of at most t faulty nodes. Moreover, it increases the allowed faulty nodes, hence enhancing the diagnosability of the system. We can find that the t/s-diagnosability of n-dimensional folded hypercube FQn has not been studied under the PMC model and MM* model. In this paper, we determine the t/s-diagnosability of FQn under the PMC model and MM* model. First, we propose some new fault tolerant properties of FQn. Then we prove that the t/s-diagnosability of n-dimensional folded hypercube FQn is (n+1)g−12(g−1)(g+2) for 2≤g≤12(n−1) where s=(n+1)g−12(g−1)(g+2)+g−2 under both the PMC model and MM* model. In addition, we establish two t/s-diagnosis algorithms of complexity O(Nlog2N) and complexity O(N(log2N)2) to isolate the faulty nodes in a node subset of the system under the PMC model and MM* model, respectively. The comparison analysis results showed that the t/s-diagnosability of FQn is the largest, and it increases faster than the other types of diagnosability as n increases.

1. Introduction
With the development of semiconductor technology and the increasing use of large-scale multiprocessing systems, the safety and stability of multiprocessor systems are becoming more and more important. The fault diagnosis of system is an important measure to ensure system reliability. The technique of identifying faulty nodes within a multicomputer by conducting tests on the nodes and interpreting the test outcomes is called as the system-level diagnosis [23].

Several different models have been proposed for the purpose of self-diagnosis of a system. Preparata et al. [21] described a widely fault diagnosis model, PMC model, under which each node can test its neighboring nodes, and the test results are either “faulty” or “fault-free” [15]. For any edge uv, the ordered pair  represents the test performed by u on v [2]. Subsequently, Malek and Maeng [20] proposed the another fault diagnostic model, MM model (also called comparison model). Under the MM model, a test contains a node w and its two neighbors  [3]. The node w sends the same input to  and then compares their feedback. If w is faulty, the test result is unreliable [1]. Under the MM* model [22], every node must compare any pair of its neighbors, which is a special MM model.

Preparata et al. [21] proposed the concept for t-diagnosable of a system, assuming that if given a syndrome, all nodes can be correctly identified as faulty or fault-free, provided that the number of faulty nodes present in the system does not exceed t. The diagnosability is the maximum number of faulty nodes that can be correctly identified. Hsieh and Lee [8] proved that the classical diagnosability of n-dimensional folded hypercube 
 is  for  under the PMC model. Li et al. [10] proved that the classical diagnosability of k-dimensional DCell with n-port switches is  under MM* model. Since the classical diagnostic strategy involves identifying only the faulty processors, it is also known as the precise diagnostic strategy. The precise diagnosability is often rather low, because it is upper-bounded by the minimum degree of the underlying network. It is later realized that the requirement that all the faulty processors are precisely and exclusively identified is unnecessarily restrictive. Later on, Friedman [5] proposed the concept for -diagnosable of a system, also called the pessimistic diagnosis strategy, in which the fault-set is allowed to contain some fault-free nodes. It can isolate all of the faulty nodes to within a set of size at most t in the presence of at most t faulty nodes. The -diagnosability (or pessimistic diagnosability) of a system is the maximal number of faulty processors so that the system is -diagnosable. The -diagnosability of a system is usually larger than its classical diagnosability. The -diagnosability of 
 is 2n [12], which is larger than classical diagnosability of it under the PMC model. To further increase the degree of diagnosability, Somani and Peleg [24] then proposed the concept for -diagnosable () of a system if, provided that the number of faulty nodes is bounded by t, all faulty nodes can be isolated into a node set, which may contain no more than k fault-free nodes. For a given positive integer k, the -diagnosability of a system is the maximal number of faulty processors so that the system is -diagnosable. Recently, Yang et al. [27] proved that the n-dimensional BC network is 
 
-diagnosable under the PMC model. Zhou et al. [30] proved that the n-dimensional star graph 
 is -diagnosable for . Li and Xu [11] later showed that the 
 is -diagnosable and it was not -diagnosable for . Lin et al. [17] proposed a general -diagnosable algorithm  for some regular networks, including the n-dimensional alternating group graph 
, n-dimensional split-star network 
, 
-hypermesh 
 and -star graph 
. Different from -diagnosable, Friedman [5] introduced the concept for -diagnosable () of a system if, given a syndrome and positive integers t and s, the set of faulty nodes can be isolated into a node set of size at most s provided that the number of faulty nodes does not exceed t, which is a generalization of the -diagnosable. For a given positive integer s, the -diagnosability of a system is the maximal number of faulty processors so that the system is -diagnosable. The disadvantage of the -diagnosable is that the upper bound on the number of incorrectly diagnosed nodes is , which can be large in comparison with the actual number of faulty nodes. In such a strategy, the set of nodes identified by the algorithm may contain one or more fault-free nodes, but it must contain all the faulty nodes. The key difference between -diagnosability and -diagnosability is that -diagnosability limits the size of the diagnosed fault-set by s without limiting the number of misdiagnosed fault-free nodes in the diagnosed fault-set, while -diagnosability limits the number of misdiagnosed fault-free nodes in the diagnosed fault-set by k without limiting the size of the diagnosed fault-set. And it is worth noting that for the same system, -diagnosability is usually greater than -diagnosability because that if a system is -diagnosable, then it must be -diagnosable. Recently, Liang and Zhang [13] proved that an n-dimensional hypercube 
 is -diagnosable in terms of both the PMC model and comparison model, where  and . Moreover, Liang et al. [14] proved that 
 is 
-diagnosable, where  and . In summary, Liang et al. [13], [14] only give the -diagnosable of 
 and 
, but they do not propose the -diagnosability of 
 and 
. Moreover, -diagnosability for many other well-known networks have not been studied.

El-Amawy and Latifi [4] proposed a very famous interconnection network, n-dimensional folded hypercube 
, which is a variation of the hypercube by adding some edges. An n-dimensional folded hypercube 
 has the same number of nodes as that of n-dimensional hypercube 
, and has 
 more edges than 
. The diameter of 
 is about half of the diameter of 
 [4]. Moreover, 
 preserves the symmetric properties of 
. Many of the diagnosabilities of 
 have been extensively studied, which are summarized in Table 1. However, the -diagnosability of 
 is unknown.

The -diagnosability is an important and widely accepted diagnostic strategy as a new measure of diagnosability, which guarantees that the set of faulty nodes can be isolated to within a set of at most s nodes provided that the number of faulty nodes does not exceed t. Moreover, it increases the allowed faulty nodes, hence enhancing the diagnosability of the network. And we can find that the -diagnosability of 
 has not been studied under the PMC model and MM* model. Motivated by the above observation, we first propose some novel properties of 
 and apply them to evaluate the -diagnosability of 
 under the PMC model and MM* model. We prove that the -diagnosability of 
 is 
 
 for 
 
 where 
 
 under both the PMC model and MM* model. Moreover, we establish two -diagnosis algorithms of complexity 
 and complexity 
 to isolate the faulty nodes in a node subset of the system under the PMC model and MM* model, respectively. The comparison analysis results show that the -diagnosability of 
 is the largest, and it increases faster than the other types of diagnosability as n increases.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives some notations and definitions. Section 3 presents the -diagnosability of 
 under the PMC model and MM* model. In Section 4, we propose two fast algorithms to identify all fault nodes. In Section 5, we perform a comparative analysis of our results with other known diagnosabilities. Section 6 draws a conclusion.

2. Preliminaries
We present some necessary terms in graph theory. Then we give the definition of -diagnosability. Moreover, we show the definition of 
.

2.1. Terminologies and notations
The notation  represents an interconnection network, where  and  denote the sets of nodes and edges of G, respectively. Also, the terms  and  denote the numbers of nodes and edges of G, respectively.

A subgraph D of G, denoted by , is a graph in which  and . The subgraph of G induced by a subset S of , denoted by , is the graph with the node-set S and the edge-set . Let 
 be m subgraphs of G, we set 
 and 
. When G is a graph and ,  denotes a graph obtained by removing all nodes in F from G and deleting those edges with at least one end-node in F, simultaneously.

We use 
 to denote the neighborhood of node v in G is . For a set of nodes , we define 
.

2.2. The t/s-diagnosable of a system under the PMC model and MM* model
Given a network , under the PMC model [18], any two adjacent nodes are capable of performing tests on each other. For any edge , the ordered pair  represents the test performed by u on v [26]. In this situation, u is called the tester node and v is called the tested node. The test outcome of node u testing node v is represented by .  (resp., 0) implies that node v is faulty (resp., fault-free) when the test node u is fault-free. The PMC model assumes that a fault-free node should always give correct test-result, whereas the test result given by a faulty node is unreliable [31]. Under the MM* model [3], a node w is a comparator for node u and node v if and only if  and  [16]. The test outcome of comparator w testing u and v is denoted by . Moreover,  implies that at least one of nodes u and v is faulty and  implies that nodes u and v are all fault-free when the comparator w is fault-free. If node w is faulty, then  can be arbitrary [32]. A test result is reliable (resp., unreliable) if the comparator is fault-free (resp., faulty). The collection of all test results over the entire system is referred to as a syndrome.

The following is intended to introduce a definition of allowable fault set (AFS) of the system for a syndrome under the PMC model and MM* model, respectively. Moreover, we present an important lemma for identifying fault-free set. To this end, we introduce an important definition of -diagnosable of a system.

Definition 1

[5] For a given system  and a syndrome σ, a set  is called an allowable fault set (AFS) of the system for syndrome σ under the PMC model, if for any two nodes  such that , and

(1)
if , then ;

(2)
if  and , then .

Definition 2

[5] For a given system  and a syndrome ω, a set  is called an allowable fault set (AFS) of the system for the syndrome ω under the MM* model, if for any three nodes  such that  and , and

(1)
if  and , then ;

(2)
if  and , then .

Lemma 1

[5] For a given system  with at most t faulty nodes and a syndrome is produced by the faulty set. For a connected subgraph 
 of G, then the following claims hold:

(1) Under the PMC model, if the test results are all 0 and 
, then all the nodes of 
 are fault-free.

(2) Under the MM* model, if the test results are all 0 and 
 and each node of 
 has at least two neighbors in 
, then all the nodes of 
 are fault-free.

Definition 3

[5] A system G is -diagnosable  if and only if all the faulty nodes can be isolated within a set of size at most s in the presence of at most t faulty nodes. For given a positive integer s, the -diagnosability of a system is the maximal number of faulty processors so that the system is -diagnosable.

Fig. 1 gives an illustration of a 4/7-diagnosable system. In Fig. 1, the set F denotes the set of identified faulty nodes, the set C denotes the set of fault-free nodes that have been identified, and the set P represents the set of fault-free nodes that cannot be accurately identified. Then , .

2.3. Folded hypercubes
The definitions of the hypercube and the folded hypercube are listed as follows.

Definition 4

 is an undirected graph with the node set 
, , namely, all binary sequences of length n on the set , and two nodes are adjacent if and only if they differ exactly in one position.

For any , the n-dimensional hypercube 
 can be decomposed into two node- and edge-disjoint -dimensional subcubes, denoted by 
 and 
, which are induced by the sets 
 and 
, respectively.

 to isolate all faulty nodes into a node subset of size s under the PMC model and MM* model, respectively.

4.1. A -diagnosable algorithm under the PMC model
We will give a fast -diagnosable algorithm under the PMC model, named Fast -Diagnosable under the PMC Model (FtsDPMC), by using the largest fault-free component to identify the remaining nodes in the system (see Algorithm 1). We list the formal descriptions of the algorithms as follows.

Furthermore, we show the correctness of the FtsDPMC algorithm by the following theorem.

Theorem 7

Let S and C be the two sets of outputs of the FtsDPMC algorithm when taking as input a syndrome σ on an n-dimension folded hypercube 
 produced by a real faulty set. The following results hold:

Proof

According to Theorem 1 and Theorem 3, we can prove that the FtsDPMC algorithm can always output one set C with  for 
 provided the number of faulty nodes does not exceed t where 
 
. By Lemma 1 (1) and Theorem 3, we can prove that all nodes of the output set C are fault-free and all nodes of the output set S contain all faulty nodes. Moreover, the set S produced before Step 24 in Algorithm 1 consists of all faulty nodes. Hence, . Furthermore, 
 of Step 27 in Algorithm 1 is the union of small components of 
. By Theorem 1 and Theorem 3, 
. Therefore, after Algorithm 1, the size of S is 
 
. □

Finally, we analyze the time complexity of the FtsDPMC algorithm.

 to build all 
's in the worst case.

Steps 17-18:  time as it takes  to determine sizes of all 
's and build C.

Steps 19-23: 
 time as it takes 
 to build S.

Steps 24-28:  time as it takes  to determine the size of S and takes  to build S or C.

4.2. A -diagnosis algorithm under the MM* model
Furthermore, we show the correctness of the FtsDMM* algorithm by the following theorem.

Theorem 9

Let S and C be the two sets of outputs of the FtsDMM* algorithm when taking as input a syndrome ω on an n-dimension folded hypercube 
 produced by a real faulty set. The following results hold:

.

Proof

According to Theorem 1 and Theorem 5, we can prove that the FtsDMM* algorithm can always output one set C with  for 
 provided the number of faulty nodes does not exceed t where 
 
. By Lemma 1 (2) and Theorem 5, we can prove that all nodes of the output set C are fault-free and all nodes of the output set S contain all faulty nodes. Moreover, the set S produced before Step 29 in Algorithm 2 consists of all faulty nodes. Hence, . Furthermore, 
 of Step 32 in Algorithm 2 is the union of small components of 
. By Theorem 1 and Theorem 7, 
. Therefore, after Algorithm 2, the size of S is

Finally, we analyze the time complexity of the FtsDMM* algorithm.

Theorem 10

The FtsDMM* algorithm has a time complexity 
, where 
 is the size of 
.

Proof

The time taken by the steps of the FtsDMM* algorithm is listed below:

Step 1:  time.

Step 2: 
 time as it takes 
 to build the 0-comparison subgraph 
 by Algorithm 3.

Steps 3-16: 
 time as it visits all nodes and all their neighbors in the worst case, and it takes 
 to build all 
's in the worst case.

Step 17:  time as it takes  to determine sizes of all 
's.

Steps 18-23: 
 time as it takes 
 to build C.

Steps 24-28: 
 time as it takes 
 to build S.

Steps 29-33:  time as it takes  to determine the size of S and takes  to build S or C.

Steps 1-33: 
 time.

Therefore, the theorem holds. □

6. Conclusion
In this paper, we present some new and important properties of n-dimensional folded hypercube 
. Based on the new properties of

 where 
 
 under both the PMC model and MM* model. In addition, we establish two -diagnosis algorithms of complexity 
 and complexity 
 to isolate the faulty nodes in a node subset of the system under the PMC model and MM* model, respectively. The comparison results show that the -diagnosability of 
 is the largest, and it increases faster than the other types of diagnosability as n increases.

In future, we will extend this work to the -diagnosability of general interconnection networks, and their identification algorithms.
