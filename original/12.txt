Abstract
Subliminal techniques have been used to enhance and enrich the interaction efficiency between humans and computers. However, the extent to which they are effective when presented at the periphery of the visual field remains unexplored. In addition, it is still unclear which stimulus type is more effective at influencing decisions when presented in peripheral areas. In this work, we investigate the degree to which three types of subliminal stimuli (images, shapes, words) are effective at influencing selection decisions, and how their efficiency degrades when presented at different visual angles. In a controlled study, we examine the selection performance of subliminal stimuli that are presented at thirteen visual angles and tested using two presentation durations (33ms, 66ms). Our findings suggest that subliminal words can be effective at peripheral angles. Also, types comparison showed that the word stimulus outperformed other types at specific visual angles. These findings provide insights for understanding how peripheral subliminal techniques can be used to support users while performing primary tasks. We examine these findings, present potential use-case scenarios for peripheral subliminal techniques and discuss ethical considerations around their use in user interfaces.

1. Introduction
Subliminal perception is considered a well-supported concept that refers to an influence on behaviour or decisions despite the lack of awareness of the subliminal stimulus (Kouider and Dehaene, 2007). Subliminal priming; which is one way to study subliminal perception, examines the effect produced by the subliminal stimulus on the given task. This priming effect occurs either as an enhanced performance in selection tasks (i.e., higher accuracy levels or shorter reaction times) (Schacter and Buckner, 1998) or as a greater preference to the subliminally presented stimulus in preference tasks  (Bornstein and D’Agostino, 1992).

Behavioural and neuroimaging studies have reported the influence of subliminal stimuli on performance at various levels; motor, visual, lexical, semantic and affective (Dehaene, Naccache, Le Clec’H, Koechlin, Mueller, Dehaene-Lambertz, van de Moortele, Le Bihan, 1998, Greenwald, Draine, Abrams, 1996, Kiefer, Brendel, 2006, Kouider, Dehaene, 2007, Prochnow, Kossack, Brunheim, Müller, Wittsack, Markowitsch, Seitz, 2013). These findings have inspired researchers to use subliminal stimuli in domains such as consumer behaviour (Strahan et al., 2002), artificial intelligence (Schank, 2009) and HCI (Aranyi, Kouider, Lindsay, Prins, Ahmed, Jacucci, Negri, Gamberini, Pizzi, Cavazza, 2014, Chalfoun, Frasson, 2008).

In HCI, subliminal priming is useful in enhancing the interaction efficiency between humans and computers as it transfers information without causing additional workload on the sensory channels (Negri, Gamberini, Cutini, 2014, Riener, 2017). Previous studies have tested this concept under specific conditions (i.e., presenting the stimulus at the centre of the screen and the user is asked to focus on that central location during the task) and used it in applications such as learning (Chalfoun and Frasson, 2011), behaviour change (Caraban, Karapanos, Teixeira, Munson, Campos, 2017, Ham, Midden, Beute, 2009, Pinder, Vermeulen, Cowan, Beale, Hendley, 2017, Riener, Chalfoun, Frasson, 2014), assistance (DeVaul et al., 2003) and gaming (Aranyi, Kouider, Lindsay, Prins, Ahmed, Jacucci, Negri, Gamberini, Pizzi, Cavazza, 2014, Cetnarski, Betella, Prins, Kouider, Verschure, 2014).

However, our understanding of the extent to which subliminal techniques are effective at influencing decisions in different conditions remains limited. In particular, it is unclear whether subliminal stimuli could affect decisions when presented outside of the central area and in the periphery of the visual field. Although our foveal vision (i.e., central vision which covers three degrees of the visual field) plays the most important role in visual information processing, we also depend heavily on our peripheral vision in various tasks (Simpson, 2017). Subliminal priming research in HCI presents subliminal stimuli at the centre of the screen and the user is required to focus on that location to ensure that the subliminal stimulus occurs in foveal vision, which is also a typical setup in psychology research. However, foveal presentations become problematic when aiming to support users while performing tasks in user interfaces. This occurs due to the foveal vision being occupied by the user’s primary task and providing subliminal support in the same foveal area results in interruption of the main task. Although the subliminal stimulus cannot be perceived due to its short presentation duration, the mask that follows and/or precedes the subliminal stimulus; which is important to ensure that the visual buffer has been overwritten  (den Bussche et al., 2009), could be perceived as they are presented using a longer presentation duration compared to the subliminal stimulus  (Bargh and Chartrand, 2000). In addition, previous studies have used different types of visual subliminal stimuli including textual (Caraban, Karapanos, Teixeira, Munson, Campos, 2017, DeVaul, Pentland, Corey, 2003) and graphical (Aranyi, Kouider, Lindsay, Prins, Ahmed, Jacucci, Negri, Gamberini, Pizzi, Cavazza, 2014, Cetnarski, Betella, Prins, Kouider, Verschure, 2014, Chalfoun, Frasson, 2011, Riener, Chalfoun, Frasson, 2014). However, it remains unclear which stimulus type is more effective at influencing decisions when presented in peripheral areas.

Understanding how subliminal stimuli behave in the periphery is important because it allows designing systems that transfer information without causing additional cognitive load and without interrupting the task at hand. An Example of a potential use case is a system that provides peripheral subliminal notifications of non-critical information to users while carrying out a complex, attention-demanding task (e.g., driving). Presenting such information overtly or subliminally in the foveal vision would interrupt and distract the user from the primary task. Also, examining peripheral subliminal stimuli becomes important to the field of HCI as display environments become larger in size and the offered field of view (e.g., ambient/large displays, multi-monitor setups and head-mounted displays). Whilst prior studies have examined peripheral vision to support users in large desktop setups using visible visual stimuli (e.g.,  (Gutwin, Cockburn, Coveney, 2017, Heun, von Kapri, Maes, 2012)), exploring subliminal stimuli in such setups remains unexamined. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the limits of subliminal stimuli and how to use them in large setups to provide support in user interfaces with minimal disruption on ongoing tasks.

We present a controlled study that compares different types of subliminal visual stimuli and examines the visual limits of the priming effect. In particular, in a selection task, we analyse the priming effect of three types of visual stimuli (images, geometric shapes and words), presented at thirteen visual angles and tested using two presentation duration conditions (33 ms and 66 ms). We evaluate the effect using reaction times and success rates. Our study is designed to answer the following research questions RQ1: For each stimulus type, can the subliminal stimulus influence the selection performance when presented in peripheral vision areas? RQ2: Which stimulus type shows better selection performance at the peripheral angles? RQ3: Which presentation duration is more effective for peripheral subliminal presentations?

1.1. Contributions, originality and relevance
The contributions of this work are two-fold. First, we present a controlled study that compares three stimulus types presented at thirteen visual angles. This is original because it goes beyond the current related work. Pinder et al. (Pinder et al., 2017) studied different types; polygons, faces and text, however, all stimuli were presented at the centre of a mobile phone. To our knowledge only one study  (Pfleging et al., 2013) was conducted at different locations within a single screen (i.e., visual field of  20
 of visual angle). This study examined a limited number of angles and only one type of subliminal stimulus. Our study thus goes further by examining three different stimulus types when presented at 13 visual angles, extending to  60
 of visual angle at 70 cm viewing distance, within a multiple screen setup. Second, we provide empirical evidence that subliminal stimuli can be presented in peripheral vision areas. In particular, the word stimulus showed priming effects (i.e., high success rates) at many peripheral angles which suggests that textual stimuli could be used as peripheral subliminal stimuli to influence or enhance task performance. In addition, type comparison results showed that textual stimuli have performed better than images and shapes at some peripheral angles. This is relevant because the findings of this study can be useful for providing notifications, encouraging behavioural changes and assisting users in user interfaces without interrupting the user’s primary task.

1.2. Outline
This article begins by reviewing work relevant to subliminal priming in psychology and HCI domains. In Section 3, the methodology of the study is described. The results of the study are then presented and discussed. Finally, the article is concluded with a discussion of the possible applications and study limitations.

2. Background
In this section, we first describe the human visual field. We then explain the concept of priming, which is a central notion to understand how subliminal priming works. We discuss evidence of the effectiveness of subliminal stimuli. Finally, we review previous work on subliminal priming in HCI.

2.1. Human field of view
The human field of view (FOV) is a measure of the angular area that can be viewed instantaneously (Bowman et al., 2007). It covers approximately 200
-220
 horizontally and 135
 vertically with 60
 upwards and 75
 downwards. The foveal, parafoveal and peripheral visual areas work together to construct our field of view, as shown in Fig. 1. The fovea is the central area of the retina and covers nearly three degrees of the visual field. The parafovea is the area that surrounds the fovea, and it extends to five degrees from the eye centre (i.e., ten degrees across) (Strasburger et al., 2011). The peripheral vision is the area that surrounds the central vision. It is divided into three areas: near peripheral vision which spans from  5
 to  30
 mid-peripheral vision which covers the area from  30
 to  60
 and far-peripheral vision which covers areas above  60
 (Simpson, 2017, Wolfe, Dobres, Rosenholtz, Reimer, 2017). Foveal, parafoveal, near-peripheral and mid-peripheral vision areas can be seen by both eyes (i.e., binocular visual field). Far peripheral vision can only be seen with the left or right eye (i.e., monocular visual field) (Ruch and Fulton, 1960).

2.2. Priming
Priming occurs in a non-conscious form of the human memory (i.e., implicit memory) and is observed when previous experiences influence current behaviour or thought (Schacter, Buckner, 1998, Tulving, Schacter, 1990). A commonly used experimental paradigm to assess priming consists of two stages. The first stage; exposure stage which involves presenting the stimuli. Followed by the test stage which asks subjects to identify stimulus after a brief display, complete a fragmented form of a word or picture or select a preferred stimulus (Rajaram, Roediger, 1993, Schacter, Chiu, Ochsner, 1993). The priming effect is indicated by a facilitation or an enhanced performance in the previously exposed stimuli relative to new stimuli (Schacter and Buckner, 1998). For example, in visual word priming tasks such as stem completion, the priming effect is observed when the stem (e.g., for__) is completed with a previously exposed stimuli (e.g., forest)  (Schacter et al., 1993). In many other priming tasks, the priming effect occurs when the subliminal stimulus affects the accuracy or speed of the response (Greenwald et al., 1996).

There are two techniques to deliver priming; supraliminal or subliminal. Supraliminal priming, also known as ”conscious priming”, occurs above the threshold of conscious perception in which the individual is aware of the stimulus but not its purpose (Bargh and Chartrand, 2000). On the other hand, subliminal priming involves the presentation of a stimulus below the threshold of conscious perception in which the individual is not aware of both the stimuli and its purpose (Bargh, Chartrand, 2000, Dijksterhuis, Aarts, Smith, 2005).

2.3. Subliminal priming
A subliminal stimulus is a sensory stimulus that can have an impact on the brain only when presented below a person’s conscious perception (Elgendi, Kumar, Barbic, Howard, Abbott, Cichocki, 2018, Kouider, Dehaene, 2007). Presenting subliminal stimuli involves very short presentation durations as well as a masking technique to ensure that that visual buffer has been overwritten (Bargh and Chartrand, 2000). Cognitive neuroscientists showed brain activations in response to subliminal stimuli using techniques such as functional Magnetic Response Imaging (fMRI) and Event-Related Potentials (ERPs)  (Kouider and Dehaene, 2007). fMRI and ERP studies showed evidence of subliminal perception at motor, emotional and semantic levels (Dehaene, Naccache, Le Clec’H, Koechlin, Mueller, Dehaene-Lambertz, van de Moortele, Le Bihan, 1998, Eimer, Schlaghecken, 1998, Morris, Öhman, Dolan, 1998, Verleger, Jaśkowski, Aydemir, van der Lubbe, Groen, 2004). Greenwald et al.  (Greenwald et al., 1996) used fMRI and ERP to study the spatial and temporal properties of motor priming. Their fMRI results showed an activation in the motor cortex. ERP results also exhibited an activation after presenting the subliminal stimulus. These techniques show evidence that the brain is capable of processing unconsciously perceived stimuli.

In addition, several behavioural studies have demonstrated the influence of different types of subliminal stimuli on behaviour/decisions (Bar, Biederman, 1998, Eimer, Schlaghecken, 1998, Greenwald, Draine, Abrams, 1996, Klotz Peter Wolff, 1995, Verleger, Jaśkowski, Aydemir, van der Lubbe, Groen, 2004). For instance, researchers showed that subliminally presented pictures (Bar and Biederman, 1998), arrows  (Eimer and Schlaghecken, 1998) and shapes (Klotz Peter Wolff, 1995) can bias response decisions. The influence of semantic priming was also explored using words and numbers. For example, Greenwald et al.  (Greenwald et al., 1996) investigated semantic priming using a semantic categorisation task that involves words, and found that subliminal words were able to impact the judged meaning of subsequent words. Additionally, Dehaene et al. (Dehaene et al., 1998) performed a semantic categorisation task on numbers and showed that congruent subliminal numbers can positively affect the categorisation of following numbers (i.e., shorter reaction times). However, psychology studies tend to use a different task for each stimulus type, and it is still unclear which type is more effective at influencing behaviour/decisions if the same task was used.

Behavioural studies also examined changing the location of the subliminal stimuli and whether the location shift impacts the priming effect. For example, previous studies presented subliminal stimuli at the foveal (e.g., (Dehaene, Naccache, Le Clec’H, Koechlin, Mueller, Dehaene-Lambertz, van de Moortele, Le Bihan, 1998, Eimer, Schlaghecken, 1998, Greenwald, Draine, Abrams, 1996, Schiaghecken, Eimer, 2000)), parafoveal (e.g., (Bar, Biederman, 1998, Huang, Murnighan, 2010, Schiaghecken, Eimer, 2000, Strahan, Spencer, Zanna, 2002)) and peripheral (e.g., (Van der Stigchel et al., 2009)) vision areas. Schiaghecken et al.  (Schiaghecken and Eimer, 2000) studied both the foveal (i.e., fixation point) and parafoveal (i.e., five degrees from the central fixation) areas and found that parafoveal presentations are also able to produce positive priming effects (i.e., shorter reaction times and lower error rates in compatible trials compared to incompatible trials). In addition, in a study that examined the impact of subliminal stimuli on saccade metrics, van der Stigchel et al. (Van der Stigchel et al., 2009) presented a peripheral subliminal distractor while participants are making vertical eye movements to a target that was shown above or below the fixation point. While their study showed that a peripheral subliminal distarctor influences saccade trajectories, these results are limited to a stimulus that was presented 7.6
 from the fixation point at a 75 cm viewing distance. Therefore, it is unclear whether subliminal stimuli would impact responses if presented at peripheral angles that go beyond their studied visual angle and extend to  60
 at a viewing distance of 70 cm.

2.4. Subliminal priming in HCI
Several studies have used subliminal techniques in user interfaces to assist and guide users in different tasks. For instance, Devaul et al. (DeVaul et al., 2003) presented a wearable subliminal cueing system that provides just-in-time memory support. They used a head-mounted display to show textual subliminal stimuli of names learned during a memorisation phase. Their results showed that subliminal stimuli have significantly enhanced the identification performance of names. In addition, researchers have investigated the use of subliminal priming to enhance learning (Chalfoun, Frasson, 2008, Chalfoun, Frasson, 2011, Jraidi, Chalfoun, Frasson, 2012). Chalfoun et al. (Chalfoun and Frasson, 2011) examined the use of subliminal stimuli in a tutoring system. Graphical subliminal stimuli (arrows) were presented to guide the learner in a problem-solving task. Their results showed that positive subliminal stimuli have improved the learner’s overall performance.

Subliminal techniques have also been explored as a way to change health-related behaviours (Caraban, Karapanos, Teixeira, Munson, Campos, 2017, Pinder, Vermeulen, Cowan, Beale, Hendley, 2017) as well as driving behaviours (Riener, 2017, Riener, Chalfoun, Frasson, 2014). For example, Pinder et al. (Pinder et al., 2017) explored the feasibility of using subliminal priming on smartphones as a nonconscious behaviour change technique. They investigated the impact of stimulus types (polygons, faces and text) on liking judgements. Their results indicated that showing a subliminal text stimulus once decreases the likelihood of it being preferred compared to the control and polygon conditions. However, other types and conditions (i.e., photos and repetitions) did not increase the preference likelihood. In another behaviour change application, Caraban et al. (Caraban et al., 2017) designed a subliminal priming plug-in for Google Chrome browsers. The subliminal stimuli were presented as a slight emphasis on words (behavioural concepts promoting healthier lifestyle) which were presented at different locations within the webpage. Their study showed that subliminal stimuli were selected significantly more than the other conditions.

Furthermore, subliminal techniques are considered promising in improving experiences in virtual environments. For instance, Aranyi et al. (Aranyi et al., 2014) investigated whether subliminal stimuli (3D food items); presented at the centre of the screen, could bias selection behaviour in a food selection task. Their results demonstrated a significant overall priming effect in the selection task, but the magnitude was not large enough for practical interface applications. Also, they showed that the priming effect was significantly larger when the stimuli were presented multiple times. Cetnarski et al. (Cetnarski et al., 2014) used a mixed-reality system to study the impact of subliminal stimuli on navigation decisions in a virtual maze. Their findings showed that navigation decisions were influenced by the graphical subliminal stimuli.

In contrast, several studies have used subliminal techniques to improve interactions but were unable to find any significant differences. For example, Gonçalves et al. (Gonçalves et al., 2017) developed a text editor to display textual subliminal and supraliminal hints to support and assist users in creative writing tasks. However, no significant differences were found between pre and post measures of experienced creativity in the subliminal condition. Also, Pfleging et al. (Pfleging et al., 2013) investigated the use of subliminal stimuli to enhance visual search tasks. Their study examined graphical subliminal stimuli presented at different locations in single screen with a visual field of maximum  20 degrees of visual angle at 70 cm viewing distance. However, their results showed that visible stimuli were effective while subliminal stimuli could not improve search performance.

While some preliminary work show priming evidence using graphical and textual stimuli, it is still unclear which type is more effective at influencing decisions. HCI subliminal priming studies conducted so far present their stimuli at the centre of the visual field while the user is focused on this location, which is quite typical in psychology studies. For example, Pinder et al. (Pinder et al., 2017) studied different types; polygons, faces and text presented at the centre of a mobile phone. To our knowledge only one study  (Pfleging et al., 2013) was conducted at different locations within a single screen (i.e., visual field of  20
 of visual angle). However they only used a single screen with limited numbers of angle within the visual field, and only one type of subliminal stimulus. Our study thus goes further by examining three different stimulus types when presented at thirteen visual angles, extending to  60
 of visual angle at 70 cm viewing distance, within a multiple screen setup.

Examining peripheral subliminal stimuli is important for the field of HCI because it allows designing systems that provide support to users without adding additional cognitive demands and without interrupting ongoing tasks. As a first step towards understanding peripheral subliminal techniques and their use in various applications, we explore the feasibility of presenting subliminal stimuli across the visual field, covering areas that are used by large display setups.

3. Study
To address the gaps stated in the previous section, we conducted a controlled study to examine the influence of different types of subliminal stimuli (images, shapes and words) when presented across the visual field. To cover the selected visual field areas, we chose twenty-three locations distributed across these areas. We particularly reproduced a previous setup used for pop-out visual stimuli (Gutwin et al., 2017). We tested two presentation durations: 1) the average duration used in the literature to display centrally located subliminal stimuli (33 ms); and 2) a longer duration (66 ms) to test peripheral locations, as the literature suggests that the para-foveal area (i.e., the area around the fixation point) requires longer durations compared to foveal presentations (Bargh, Chartrand, 2000, Smith, McCulloch, 2012). We obtained ethics approval from the university’s ethics committee before carrying out the study.

3.1. Apparatus
The experiment was conducted using a three-monitor setup. Fig. 2 shows the curve arrangement of the three monitors that covers 60
 of the visual field. We used three 23-inch LCD screens at a resolution of 5760x1080 pixels, with a physical size of 20x11inches and a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The monitors were connected to a single NVIDIA graphics card. The same brightness and contrast settings were applied to the three monitors. Participants were seated 70 cm from the centre of all the three monitors. This was done by manually measuring the distance from the screens then adjusting the chair accordingly. We adjusted chairs based on the height of each participant. The chair was then fixed and participants were instructed not to move. We used PsychoPy (Peirce, 2007) to program our study and ran it on a Windows 10 PC.

3.2. Participants
Twenty-four university staff and students (12 men, 12 women, mean age = 29.5, min=19, max=40) were recruited for our experiment. The mean duration of computer use per day was 7 hours. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Participants recruited included native English speakers and non-native speakers with advanced English skills. They were recruited within our institution and received a financial incentive for their participation.

3.3. Independent variables
The independent variables were stimulus type, visual angle and presentation duration. We explain below the selected settings for each variable.

3.3.1. Stimulus type
We used three visual stimulus types: images, geometric shapes and words. Fig. 3 shows examples of the stimuli used in the study. As mentioned earlier, images and words were commonly used in the literature as subliminal stimuli. Since images and words are meaningful stimuli, they might cause a response bias. Geometric shapes, however, are abstract and meaningless stimuli and were previously used as control subliminal stimuli (Pinder et al., 2017). Therefore, in this study, we examined and compared the impact of these types on the given task. All stimuli were neutral (non-affective). Stimuli were presented in black and appeared on a white background.

•
Images: We used sixty-six simple black and white line drawings of office, home, clothing and nature objects. They were sized to 3
 of visual angle at a viewing distance of 70 cm. The drawings were selected from Snodgrass et al. (Snodgrass and Vanderwart, 1980), which is a standardised set of 260 pictures suitable for experiments investigating visual perception, language and memory. We selected this set because it offers a consistent pictorial representation of common objects. Also, this set have been used extensively in priming studies (e.g.,  (Mathalon, Roach, Ford, 2010, Srinivas, 1993, Vöhringer, Poloczek, Graf, Lamm, Teiser, Fassbender, Freitag, Suhrke, Teubert, Keller, et al., 2015)).

•
Geometric shapes: We used sixty-six irregular four, six, eight, twelve and sixteen-point polygons. They were sized to 3
 of visual angle at a viewing distance of 70 cm. Polygons were adapted from Vanderplas et al. (Vanderplas and Garvin, 1959), which were created with the goal of being difficult to name and as nonliguistic as possible. Consequently, prior work on subliminal priming used these irregular abstract polygon set as a control stimuli when compared to stimuli that can be named such as images and words (Pinder et al., 2017). We thus used this set for the abstract stimuli.

•
Words: We used sixty-six nouns with four to six letters. Words were presented in lowercase letters and were sized to 3
 of visual angle at 70 cm viewing distance. Words were derived from the MRC Psycholinguistic Database (Wilson, 1988). The average word familiarity was 545.05. Word familiarity (f) is a rating that ranges form 100 to 700, with 100 being the least familiar (i.e., meaning unknown) and 700 being the most familiar (i.e., meaning well known) (Connine et al., 1990). Since we focus in this investigation on commonly-used visual and textual stimuli, we chose words that are familiar and with known meaning. Words with low familiarity levels (f  300) and words that can be recognised but the meaning might not be known (f  400) were not included.

3.3.2. Visual angles
To study whether subliminal stimuli can influence selection performance when presented at peripheral vision areas, we needed a large setup to explore the visual field similar to Gutwin et al. (Gutwin et al., 2017) who investigated the effectiveness of visual stimuli in a large display setting. Their work examined people’s ability to perceive pop-out effects in the periphery. In this work, we used a similar apparatus setting to study subliminal stimuli across the visual field.

We selected twenty-three locations distributed across the binocular visual field which was divided into seven angles in both the right and the left of the centre of the visual field. To ensure the coverage of the visual field, we chose four locations in the near-peripheral vision and six in the mid-peripheral. These locations were divided into two vertical locations (upper and lower) to reduce signal noise for each angle, as these will be collapsed into one angle in the analysis. This resulted in eight in the near-peripheral vision and twelve in the mid-peripheral vision. Also, two locations in the parafoveal vision and one location in the foveal area (See Fig. 2). Far-peripheral vision cannot be seen with binocular vision and therefore was not included in this study.

3.3.3. Presentation duration
We used two different presentations durations: 33 ms and 66 ms to test our setup. Typically, masked stimulus presented in the foveal requires an average presentation duration of 42 ms (den Bussche et al., 2009). While regions that fall in the para-foveal (the small area around the centre) require longer presentation durations to be effective at influencing behaviours/decisions, as suggested in the literature (Bargh, Chartrand, 2000, Smith, McCulloch, 2012). We thus tested two durations; one that is commonly used when stimuli are presented centrally, and another longer duration (double the time) to investigate whether increasing the duration would be effective in presenting subliminal stimuli in peripheral areas. The stimulus presentation was synchronized with the screen’s refresh rate. Since our screens were refreshing at 60 Hz, the selected presentation durations were multiples of 16.6.

3.4. Experimental design
Due to the nature of this controlled experiment which could cause participant fatigue if many factors are tested on the same participant, we employed a mixed design, with presentation duration (33 ms or 66 ms) as a between-subject factor, and stimulus types and visual angles as within-subject factors. We assigned participants randomly to one of the two conditions: Group A, in which the stimuli presentation duration is set to 33 ms and Group B, in which the presentation duration is set to 66 ms. We counter-balanced the three stimulus types using a Latin Square and the twenty-three locations were randomised. The entire study lasted around 50 minutes per participant. Participants completed 168 trials, including 99 priming trials and 69 visibility trials. We explain below the difference between those trials.

3.5. Method
We explain below the masking technique and the procedure followed to carry out this study.

3.5.1. Masking
To ensure that subliminal stimuli remain inaccessible to the conscious perception, very brief presentation durations must be used (den Bussche, den Noortgate, Reynvoet, 2009, Eimer, Schlaghecken, 2003). In addition, the subliminal stimulus should be immediately masked by another stimulus (den Bussche et al., 2009). In this study, we used a backward masking paradigm in which the stimulus is presented for a short time followed by a mask. Masking creates a noise to erase the stimuli image from the memory (Bargh and Chartrand, 2000). For example, with the words condition we used the word ”XXXXX” as mask. For the other conditions we used a pattern mask as seen in Fig. 4. In previous work, backward masking duration ranged between 50 ms to 500 ms (Aranyi, Kouider, Lindsay, Prins, Ahmed, Jacucci, Negri, Gamberini, Pizzi, Cavazza, 2014, Cetnarski, Betella, Prins, Kouider, Verschure, 2014, Chalfoun, Frasson, 2011, Pinder, Vermeulen, Cowan, Beale, Hendley, 2017, Ruijten, Midden, Ham, 2011). In this study, we chose a masking duration of 500 ms to allow adequate time to process the subliminal stimulus before the following stimulus presentation starts.

3.5.2. Procedure
Fig. 5 shows our experimental procedure. First, participants received a brief introduction. Then, they were asked to sign a consent form and complete demographics questionnaire. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions: group A and group B explained earlier.

The experiment involved three successive stages: training, main study and debriefing, as shown in Fig. 5.

1.
In the training stage, participants were given practice trials to learn how to answer the main study. The stimuli set used in training were different from the main study to avoid learning effects.

2.
The main study stage was divided into two consecutive blocks: the stimuli priming block and the stimuli visibility block. The goal of the priming block was to test if the subliminal stimuli influenced task responses (i.e., whether subliminal stimuli were selected more and/or faster compared to novel stimuli, as explained below). The visibility block was added to test whether participants can detect the subliminal stimulus or not.

In the debriefing stage, participants were asked to report what they thought the experiment is trying to test and were asked if they were able to see any of the stimuli presented in the experiment.

3.5.3. Priming block: 99 trials
We had three consecutive counterbalanced sub-blocks corresponding to the three stimulus types (image, geometric shape, word). For example, the image sub-block starts with the stimulus presentation phase which displays 23 image stimuli at 23 different locations randomly. Every stimulus is displayed using the following sequence: fixation point (500 ms) presented at the centre of the three screens, followed by a stimulus (33 ms or 66 ms depending on the experimental condition), and the backward mask (500 ms) both presented at one of the specified 23 locations, as shown in Fig. 4. The stimulus presentation phase was repeated twice to increase priming effect as suggested in the literature (Aranyi, Kouider, Lindsay, Prins, Ahmed, Jacucci, Negri, Gamberini, Pizzi, Cavazza, 2014, Wiggs, Martin, 1998). Once the stimuli presentation phase of the image type finished, the questions phase (priming task) starts by showing a list of questions on the central screen. Shapes and words sub-blocks would start after the completion of the first sub-block (see Fig. 5).

We used a perceptual priming task similar to the task used in Aranyi et al. (Aranyi et al., 2014). This type of task is a selection task and is testing the visual form of the stimulus. Participants had to answer a two-alternative forced-choice question ”which one of the following images/shapes/words can you identify from the previous phase?” (see Fig. 6). One of the presented choices was a previously shown stimulus in the presentation phase and the other is a novel stimulus that has never been presented before. We also included ten random control questions in which the two choices shown were novel and were not presented in the previous presentation phase. Control questions were added to analyse the selection performance in the experimental trials versus control trials at angle level as it is done in the literature (DeVaul et al., 2003). Participants were instructed to keep their eyes at the fixation point during the stimulus presentation phase, and to use the mouse to make selections depending on the questions that appeared on the screen. Participants were encouraged to guess if they were unsure. Each participant completed 23 experimental trials and 10 control trials for each stimulus type. The success rates and reaction times of the responses were collected. Priming was shown when better performance; higher success rates or shorter reaction times, was found (Rajaram, Roediger, 1993, Schacter, Chiu, Ochsner, 1993).

3.5.4. Visibility block: 69 trials
The literature recommends conducting awareness checks after the priming task to ensure that stimuli were not visible to participants (Bargh and Chartrand, 2000). Most studies incorporate the awareness check as a second block in their experiments either as a visibility task (i.e., objective measure) (Aranyi, Kouider, Lindsay, Prins, Ahmed, Jacucci, Negri, Gamberini, Pizzi, Cavazza, 2014, Cetnarski, Betella, Prins, Kouider, Verschure, 2014, Pinder, Vermeulen, Cowan, Beale, Hendley, 2017) or self-reports by participants (i.e., subjective measure) (Chalfoun and Frasson, 2011). We used an objective visibility measure, similar to Aranyi et al. (Aranyi et al., 2014). Participants were instructed to choose between two fixed choices based on whether they were able to see the stimulus or not. First, the central display showed the masked stimulus for 33 ms or 66 ms depending on the condition. Then, the stimulus was shown (for longer duration) with a question mark (e.g., ”brain?”, in the case of a word stimulus), which was either congruent (50% of the time) or incongruent with the masked stimulus. The same stimuli form was used in the masked stimuli and the visibility question (i.e., if the masked stimulus is an image, the visibility question shows an image with a question mark). Participants gave an answer by selecting between ”Yes” or ”No” choices. All three types were randomly presented at 23 locations in a single block, which resulted in 69 visibility trials.

3.6. Dependent variables
The dependent variables were the success rates and reaction times. Success rates were calculated based on correct answer to the given question (i.e., whether the participant could correctly answer that the stimulus has appeared in the presentation phase). Reaction time were measured as the duration from the time the question was displayed to the time the answer was selected.

4. Results
Before we analyse success rates and reaction times, we first assess the stimuli visibility using a sensitivity index to ensure that stimuli were subliminal.

4.1. Visibility block verification
We used Signal Detection Theory (SDT), which is a standard method to assess awareness, to measure the sensitivity index d’ (d prime) for each vision area. d’ is an estimate of the signal strength or a measure of the participant’s sensory capabilities (Obrien and Feldman, 1993). It is calculated by knowing the hit (H) and false alarms (F) rates for a specific area (Macmillan, Creelman, 2004, Obrien, Feldman, 1993). We used the participants responses in the visibility task to calculate d’. The visibility task was designed to be analysed using signal detection theory, i.e., having two types of detection trials: trials were divided equally to be either congruent or incongruent with the masked stimuli. In this case, H represents the proportion of YES trials to which the subject responded 
. F is the proportion of NO trials to which the subject responded 
.(1)
where H and F  0 or 1.

The larger the d’ value, the higher the sensitivity and signal strength (Stanislaw and Todorov, 1999). This means stimuli were visible and recognisable by participants. A d’ of 4.65 (H = 0.99, F = 0.01) is considered an effective limit. Proportion correct of 0.90 and 0.60 corresponds to d’ values of 2.5 and 0.5 respectively  (Macmillan and Creelman, 2004). A d’ value of zero (H = F, proportion correct = 0.50) indicates an inability to discriminate between stimuli and hence is interpreted as a lack of conscious awareness of the stimuli  (Aranyi, Kouider, Lindsay, Prins, Ahmed, Jacucci, Negri, Gamberini, Pizzi, Cavazza, 2014, Macmillan, Creelman, 2004). To ensure that only stimuli that do not reach conscious awareness (subliminal) are examined, we used a d’ cut-off value of 00.3(error). This cut-off value accounts for detection errors by limiting changes in proportion correct to  0.05, which ensures a maximum proportion correct of 0.55. Selecting a proportion correct of more than 0.55 would risk examining visible stimuli. Based on the cut-off value, the angles that lie in the foveal and parafoveal areas in both conditions (i.e., -5, 0, +5) were not examined because their values indicate a strong signal strength (d’  1.5) and thus were considered visible. Several visual masking studies also found that 33 ms presentation duration was consciously perceived by the participant when they were presented at the centre of the visual field (e.g., (Milders, Sahraie, Logan, 2008, Pessoa, Japee, Ungerleider, 2005)). Additionally, near-peripheral area in the 66 ms condition was also eliminated from analysis (d’=0.75) and hence the angles -25, -15, 15, 25 were not studied. The remaining areas; near-peripheral and mid-peripheral areas in the 33 ms condition and mid-peripheral area in the 66 ms condition, were analysed. Fig. 7 shows d’ values for each visual field area in both presentation duration conditions (33 ms and 66 ms).

4.2. Priming effect
To answer our research questions, we first analysed success rates in the within-subject factors; stimulus angle and stimulus type, using Binomial and Cochran’s tests respectively. These tests were chosen as they were suitable for analysing dichotomous data. Reaction times of the stimulus angle factor were analysed using dependent t-test and reaction times of the stimulus type factor were analysed using Friedman test. We analysed the between subject factor; presentation duration, using Chi-square test for success rates and a Mann-Whitney test for reaction times. We used an alpha level of 0.05 for all statistical tests. In binomial and McNemar’s (post-hoc analysis for Cochran’s Q test) tests, effect size is commonly described in terms of risk ratio, odds ratio and risk difference (Borenstein et al., 2009). We converted odds ratio of the significant results to Cohen’s d measure of effect size. As mentioned earlier, we eliminated the angles -5, 0, 5 in both conditions and -25, -15, 15, 25 in the 66 ms condition from this analysis due to the high value of the sensitivity index 
. In this analysis, we collapsed and averaged upper and lower locations into angles to reduce signal noise.

4.2.1. Within-subject analysis (stimuli angles and types)
We conducted Binomial tests to compare angle-level success rates of the stimuli types in the experimental trials with success rates in control trials. Mean success rates in control trials were at a chance level. Table 1 and Table 2 show  values of the binomial test in 33 ms and 66 ms conditions. We applied Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) to correct for multiple comparisons. We used a false discovery rate of 10% in all error corrections.

In the 33 ms condition, binomial tests on the word stimulus indicated that the proportion of successes at the angles -35=0.833, -25=0.792, +15=0.667,+25=0.708, +35=0.708, +55=0.708 were higher than the expected control 0.44, (-35)=0.000 =1, (-25)=0.001 =0.87, (+15)=0.022 =0.51, (+25)=0.008 =0.62, (+35)=0.008 =0.62, (+55)=0.008 =0.62 (1-sided). No significant differences were found in success rates of the image and shape types.

In the 66 ms condition, binomial tests on the shape stimulus showed that the proportion of successes at the angles +35=0.792 and +45= 0.833 were higher than the expected control 0.57, (+35)=0.019 =0.59, (+45)=0.006 =0.74 (1-sided). A binomial test on success rates of the word stimulus indicated that the successes proportions at the angles -45=0.583, -35=0.667, +35=0.583, +45=0.625, +55=0.583 were higher than the control proportion 0.38, (-45)=0.031 =0.47, (-35)=0.004 =0.66, (+35)=0.031 =0.47, (+45)=0.011 =0.56, (+55) =0.031 =0.47 (1-sided). No significant differences were found in success rates of the image type (as shown in Table 2). Fig. 8 summarises binomial test results in 33ms and 66ms conditions.

Fig. 8. Human field of view showing central and peripheral areas. The figure shows angle-level results in the 33ms and 66ms conditions (represented as light and dark grey boxes respectively). Words showed significant success rates at many peripheral angles in the 33 ms (-35, -25, +15, +25, +35, +55) and 66 ms (-45, -35, +35, +45, +55) conditions. Shapes showed significant success rates in the 66 ms condition at the angles +35 and +45.

Reaction time data were skewed and non-normal, so we transformed these data to follow a normal distribution using Logarithm and Reciprocal transformations. Data from same transformation were analysed and compared against each other. Reaction times at the different angles were paired and tested against reaction time in the control trials. Significant reaction time results within each angle are only taken into account when their success rate is significant. Reaction time alone cannot be used as a measure of priming effectiveness. No significant differences were found in reaction times of all angles that showed significant differences in success rates.

We conducted Cochran’s Q test to compare stimulus types against each other in the two conditions. For the 33 ms duration condition, Cochran’s Q showed that there was a significant difference in the proportion of successes between types at the angles -35, X2(2) = 9.238, = 0.010 and -25, X2(2) = 13.300, =0.001. We ran post-hoc analysis using McNemar’s test on these angles to find where the differences occurred. We used Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to correct for multiple comparisons, with a false discovery rate of 10%. The angle -35 showed a statistically significant difference in the proportion of successes between the image and word stimuli, = 0.007 = 0.34 and the angle -25 showed a significant difference in the image and word stimuli, = 0.003, = -0.47 and in the shape and word stimuli, = 0.004, = 0.34. In all of these significant differences, the word stimuli showed higher success rates compared to images and shapes. No significant differences were found at any other angle in the 33 ms condition.

Stimulus types comparison was also conducted on the 66 ms condition. Cochran’s Q showed that there was a significant difference in the proportion of successes between types at the angle +45, X2(2) = 7.500 = 0.026. We applied Benjamini-Hochberg procedure in McNemar’s test to correct for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate = 10%). Pairwise comparisons revealed that there was a statistical difference at the angle +45 between the image and shape stimuli, =0.013, = 0.22. Shapes had significantly higher success rates than images.

Reaction time data were transformed using two transformation functions. In stimulus type comparison, we compare three reaction times (each belong to a stimulus type). We were unable to compare data from the same transformation against each other. Therefore, reaction times in stimulus type comparison were analysed using non-parametric Friedman test. Friedman test showed that there were no statistically significant differences in reaction times (at angles that showed significant differences in success rates) between stimulus types in 33 ms and 66 ms conditions.

4.2.2. Between-subject analysis (presentation duration)
To analyse success/failure rates, we compared each stimulus type in one condition against the same type in the other condition, creating a 2x2 table for each horizontal angle in the mid peripheral area. Since stimuli that fell in the near-peripheral area in the 66 ms condition were visible, we could not compare it with the near-peripheral in the 33 ms condition and therefore this area was eliminated from the between-subject analysis. Chi-square tests showed that there were no significant differences in success/failure rates between stimulus presentation duration conditions at all angles in the mid peripheral area. Table 3 shows p-values for the studied angles.

No statistic is computed because all participants in 33ms and 66ms conditions were able to identify the stimulus at angle 0.

We compared reaction times between conditions using a Mann-Whitney test since we were unable to compare data from the same transformation against each other. Since none of the angles showed significant differences in success rates between duration conditions, significant reaction time results were not considered.

4.3. Summary
Our findings indicated that the priming effects (i.e., high success rates) in the word stimulus were found at many peripheral angles in the 33 ms (-35, -25, +15, +25, +35, +55) and 66 ms (-45, -35, +35, +45, +55) conditions. Angle level results of shapes showed significant success rates in the 66 ms condition at the angles +35 and +45 (See Fig. 8). Type comparison results showed significant differences between image and word at -35 and -25, shape and word at -25 in the 33 ms condition, and a significant difference at +45 between image and shape in the 66 ms condition.

5. Discussion
Previous work in HCI have studied subliminal priming by presenting stimuli at the centre of the screen. In such setups, users are asked to focus on the centre of the screen in order to ensure that the stimulus is shown in the foveal vision (e.g.,  (Aranyi, Kouider, Lindsay, Prins, Ahmed, Jacucci, Negri, Gamberini, Pizzi, Cavazza, 2014, Cetnarski, Betella, Prins, Kouider, Verschure, 2014, Pinder, Vermeulen, Cowan, Beale, Hendley, 2017)), however, foveal presentations raise issues when aiming to support users in realistic contexts. In particular, the sequence of subliminal stimulus presentation (i.e., subliminal stimulus and forward/backward mask) can interrupt ongoing tasks occupying foveal vision as masks can be perceived due to their long presentation duration compared to the subliminal stimulus. To solve this issue, peripheral subliminal stimuli can be used, however, our understanding of the extent to which subliminal stimuli are effective at influencing decisions when presented in peripheral vision areas remains unclear. In addition, prior studies used both textual and graphical stimuli and it is unclear which type is more effective at influencing decisions/behaviours when presented in the periphery. In this article, we addressed these gaps by examining the impact of different types of subliminal stimuli when presented in the periphery of our vision. This article provides insights into how subliminal stimuli are perceived in the periphery of the vision. In this section, we discuss our findings in light of our research questions and summarise the insights gained from our study.

5.1. RQ1: For each stimulus type, can the subliminal stimulus influence the selection performance when presented in peripheral vision areas?
Fig. 8 summarises our angle level results. Our findings showed that subliminal stimuli can influence selection performance when presented at peripheral locations. The goal of our task was to assess the visual processing of the form of the stimuli and not assessing semantic processing, so we expected that words would cause a slight influence on the selection performance because participants might need to process the meaning of the words (high-level analysis). However, words were shown to be effective at many peripheral angles in both duration conditions. Previous research found that textual subliminal stimuli were able to influence responses when they were presented in the parafoveal vision (Huang, Murnighan, 2010, Strahan, Spencer, Zanna, 2002). This is inline with our finding in that subliminal words can induce priming effects even when not presented at the fixation point and further away from it. These results were found when the participants group included both native and non-native English speakers, it is possible that the word stimulus would cause a stronger effect if all participants were native English speakers.

We also expected that the abstract shapes would influence responses since the bias caused by meaningful stimuli is reduced, but this was not supported in our results. In addition, unexpected selection performance was shown in images when no priming effects were shown in both conditions. This result along with previous work that showed priming effects in subliminal graphical stimuli, presented in the parafoveal area (Bar, Biederman, 1998, Schiaghecken, Eimer, 2000) suggest that graphical stimuli could be effective in the periphery, further work is needed to investigate subliminal graphical stimuli in the periphery.

The reasons for these results could be related to three factors. First, it is possible that our results were affected by how the brain processes information located in different areas of the visual field, as the left visual field is processed using the right cerebral hemisphere whereas the left cerebral hemisphere processes information shown in the right visual field (Bourne, 2006). Studies have also shown that each hemisphere play an important and different role in language processing (Federmeier, Kutas, 1999, Riès, Dronkers, Knight, 2016, Van Kleeck, 1989), however, the left hemisphere dominance for language processing is high relative to right hemisphere (Vigneau et al., 2011). It is possible that the presence of more significant differences in the word stimuli in the right angles of the visual field are because subliminal words were processed by the left hemisphere which is mainly responsible for language processing (Vigneau et al., 2011). This suggests that the left hemisphere dominance of language can also be found in the processing of the subliminal word stimuli occurring in the right visual field. This also explains the absence of significant differences in the word stimuli in some of the left angles as they were processed using the right hemisphere. Second, since the stimulus complexity affects the unconscious processing of the subliminal stimuli (Song and Yao, 2016), it is possible that images and shapes, although simple black and white line drawings, were more complex to process subliminally than the short and highly familiar words. Also, since no high processing level (i.e., semantic) was required in our task, it is possible that the perceptual processing (form) of words was easier to detect than images and shapes. Third, it is possible that our findings were affected by the experimental settings tested. For example, the specific duration used between the subliminal stimuli and the questions might have resulted in difficulty in processing the stimuli such as image and shapes. It is possible that complex stimuli require shorter durations between the stimulus and the task. Further experimental work is required to test and generalise these results in different experimental manipulations.

5.2. RQ2: Which stimulus type shows better selection performance at the peripheral angles?
Our results revealed that some peripheral angles showed significant differences in success rates between the word stimulus and the other types. Particularly, the word stimulus performed better (i.e., higher success rates) than the other types at two peripheral angles in 33 ms condition. The reason for this result may be due to the complexity of the graphical stimuli, and that they were more complex to be processed subliminally than textual stimuli, as complex stimuli can reduce the priming effects (Song and Yao, 2016). It is also possible that the selected familiarity level of the word stimuli have rendered them being easier to process compared to graphical stimuli. Another reason that relates to the geometric shapes stimuli could be attributed to difficulties in distinguishing the abstract shapes as they are more similar to each other compared to the word stimuli. Even though the polygons compared in the priming task were of different point sizes, it is possible that participants were unable to identify the subliminal stimulus due to similarities found in the shown stimuli. Although some peripheral angles showed significant differences between types, we cannot confirm that the textual stimuli are more effective than graphical stimuli in all other peripheral areas. Our results in binomial tests showed more priming effects in the word stimulus, however, the difference was not significant in type comparisons using Cochran’s Q test. A previous study compared textual and graphical subliminal stimuli; presented centrally, in a perceptual priming task and found that both types showed priming effects (Kiefer et al., 2017a). Additionally, previous work showed priming effects for both textual (Huang, Murnighan, 2010, Strahan, Spencer, Zanna, 2002) and graphical (Bar, Biederman, 1998, Schiaghecken, Eimer, 2000) stimuli in parafoveal area. Therefore, we cannot generalise our finding that textual stimuli are better than graphical stimuli at all peripheral locations. Further studies are needed to investigate whether processing of types differs in peripheral areas.

5.3. RQ3: Which presentation duration is more effective for peripheral subliminal presentations?
Our findings showed no significant differences between the long presentation duration condition and the short presentation duration condition. Schmidt et al. (Schmidt et al., 2011) reports that using very short presentation durations could degrade the stimulus signal and as result, diminish the priming effect. In addition, previous studies suggest the use of longer presentation durations when presenting subliminal stimuli out of the focal point to ensure that stimuli do not fall below the priming threshold (Bargh, Chartrand, 2000, Schmidt, Haberkamp, Schmidt, 2011, Smith, McCulloch, 2012). Based on that, we expected that long presentation durations would result in a better selection performance compared to short presentation durations in peripheral areas since the stimuli might occur within the priming threshold. However, we were not able to confirm that long presentation duartions performed better than short duartions in peripheral areas. In previous work, Bar et al. (Bar and Biederman, 1998) used an average duration of 47ms for subliminal presentations in the parafoveal vision, thus it is possible that the 66ms presentation duration was not long enough to induce significant differences in selection performance from the 33ms duration in peripheral vision areas. Further investigation is needed to find a duration that can be used in peripheral areas and fall within the priming threshold. Future studies should also investigate whether each visual field area requires a different presentation duration. Identifying the user’s central/peripheral area and adjusting the presentation duration accordingly should be possible in the future since camera-based eye tracking are becoming available and it is expected that eye tracking will be embedded in many display environments (Gutwin, Cockburn, Coveney, 2017, Huang, Kwok, Ngai, Chan, Leong, 2016).

5.4. Using peripheral subliminal techniques within interactive systems
Subliminal techniques improve the interaction efficiency between humans and computers by sending information without causing additional cognitive load on users  (Negri, Gamberini, Cutini, 2014, Riener, 2017). By presenting subliminal stimuli out of the foveal vision, we ensure that cognitive demands as well as interruptions to the primary task that occur due to the sequence of stimulus presentation are limited. Peripheral subliminal techniques can be used in user interfaces to provide guidance and support or encourage behavioural changes. To ensure that the support is provided to users and the peripheral stimulus is effective, it is important to follow subliminal stimulus presentation guidelines given in the literature and this work. Prior work showed that the priming effect is short-lived, therefore, designers should ensure that the subliminal stimulus is delivered at the right time. It is also crucial that designers make sure that the stimulus remains inaccessible to the conscious mind by making sure that a masking technique has been applied and that a short presentation duration has been used as the literature suggests. Our findings extends these recommendations and suggests using textual stimuli for peripheral presentations as these were shown to be effective at influencing the selection task performance when presented in many peripheral angles. In large display environments, for instance, designers could include textual subliminal stimuli in the periphery to provide assistance to users while performing complex tasks.

5.4.1. Use case scenarios
Peripheral subliminal techniques can be used to communicate non-critical information such as notifications and cues for task guidance and behaviour change that would be distracting to the user’s primary task if presented in an overt manner. We envision the use of peripheral subliminal techniques to support users in domains such as education, assistance, behaviour change and gaming. In the following, we present several use-cases in which peripheral subliminal techniques could be used.

Notifications. Users can be notified during ongoing tasks using peripheral subliminal stimuli. This can be especially useful when foveal vision is occupied by the primary task and cannot handle any interruptions. For example, imagine Jake is driving to work in bad weather conditions. His car’s washer fluid has reached its lowest limit. In order to notify the driver without disturbing his visual focus, the car’s head-up display shows peripheral subliminal notification of the washer fluid level. The driver then detects these notifications with minimal effect on his cognitive load. Since such information is not critical while driving, disregarding or even not perceiving the subliminal notification would not result in an immediate risk.

Behaviour change. Peripheral subliminal techniques can be used to change behaviours. For example, imagine Alice is looking online for a subtle way to motivate her to move more at work. She finds a plug-in that can influence and change her behaviour with minimal disruption to her work flow. She agrees to the use of subliminal techniques in the plug-in and installs it. While conducting her statistical data analysis, the plug-in shows peripheral subliminal stimuli (e.g., words and pictures of being more active) to encourage her to change her behaviour without interrupting the task at hand. By default, the plug-in presents stimuli every 30 minutes, but she can customise it depending on her preference. She perceives these reminder stimuli and decides to move or ignore the stimulus. Ignoring or missing some stimuli does not introduce immediate threat to her and hence would not cause problems.

Unobtrusive hints. Peripheral subliminal techniques can be used to provide hints to users while carrying out a complex task. For example, imagine that Lisa is designing a 3D model using a computer-aided design software but, as a beginner, she is finding a difficulty in rotating the model in the scene view. The software detects her failed attempts and shows peripheral subliminal hints (e.g., textual hints or icons to use) without disturbing her central focus on the model. She perceives these peripheral hints implicitly and applies them to the model. Since these are hints aim at supporting the user during a complex task, there is no associated serious risk when overlooking or not perceiving them.

5.5. Ethical considerations
The use of subliminal techniques introduces important ethical considerations. A critical ethical concern is raised around their use without the user’s knowledge. In persuasive applications particularly, this can be considered a major threat to individual autonomy and free will values. For example, a system that subliminally persuades people to eat unhealthy food or buy a particular product could jeopardise autonomy since the user is unaware of the use of subliminal stimuli nor the delivered message and hence cannot evaluate the message and decide. Regardless of the application domain, we strongly believe that users should always be aware of the use of subliminal techniques in systems. Designers must clearly inform the user about the purpose of such subliminal stimuli, how they are presented, and their consequences before using the system.

While the main aim of subliminal techniques discussed in this paper is to support users during complex tasks and change behaviours for the benefit of the user, they can be used in the service of unethical and manipulative aims. A key concern here is when designers implement such techniques with deceptive goals that choose the shareholder’s interests over the user’s interests (i.e., dark patterns) (Gray et al., 2018). For example, manipulating the user interface by embedding subliminal stimuli to influence and encourage users to purchase more products(unethical marketing). When dealing with using subliminal techniques as a dark patterns strategy, it is essential to emphasise on the role of design responsibility in addressing their ethical issues (Gray et al., 2018). Designers should base their designs on core values (e.g., avoid deception, support autonomy) to ensure ethically responsible designs (Fogg, 1998, Gray, Kou, Battles, Hoggatt, Toombs, 2018).

6. Limitations and future work
The generalisability of these findings is subject to certain limitations.

6.1. Limitations of our experimental setup
Our results are limited to cases where perceptual priming (i.e., concerned with the form of the stimulus) is employed. It remains unclear whether these results would apply to other priming tasks, stimulus types and presentation durations. Future work should explore additional priming tasks and examine other presentation durations for peripheral subliminal presentations. Another source of uncertainty is the impact of the task used on our results. Research has shown that the nature of the task influences the perception of the subliminal stimuli (Kiefer, Liegel, Zovko, Wentura, 2017, Lucas, 2000, Prasad, Mishra, 2019) and it is possible that this has affected our findings. Further work is needed to assess how different tasks affect the perception of peripheral subliminal stimuli. In addition, while we carefully selected non-affective image and word stimuli for this study, a potential uncontrolled factor that could have occurred is the possibility that some participants might found certain stimuli affective, which could influence subsequent judgements (Hermans, Spruyt, De Houwer, Eelen, 2003, Luo, Peng, Jin, Xu, Xiao, Ding, 2004, Murphy, Zajonc, 1993) and hence affect our findings. Also, a limitation of our experimental setup is that the focus on the fixation point was controlled by giving instructions to participants before starting the study, as done in  (Gutwin et al., 2017). However, even though the researcher had observed the setting carefully to eliminate head or eye movements, it is possible that few unintentional movements had occurred during the study. In addition, we used in this work a fixed stimuli size for all peripheral locations. Scaling the stimulus size could enhance peripheral presentations of subliminal stimuli. Future work should examine if increasing the stimuli size (when presented in the periphery) would influence task performance. Also, our work examined horizontal angles for subliminal presentations. It is still unknown whether extending the display environment vertically would affect task responses. Further studies should investigate vertical areas to provide additional insights for subliminal presentations in large displays.

Theses previous limitations highlight some limitations for the current method to study subliminal priming and we believe that the entire community needs to investigate further. Notwithstanding these limitations, this work provides valuable insights into understanding how subliminal stimuli work in peripheral vision areas in order to support users while carrying out primary tasks in user interfaces.

6.2. Limitations for the application to HCI
In order to use subliminal techniques in more pragmatic scenarios, further understanding is needed to examine how the type of context, technology and primary/secondary task impact subliminal stimuli. We discuss these aspects below and suggest how future efforts can examine and address these limitations.

Type of Context. The context in which subliminal techniques are employed in plays an important role in their effectiveness since they use low-level stimuli that are presented below the humans conscious perception. For instance, it is possible that using the same subliminal stimuli in noisy environments would produce different effects compared to quiet environments. For the stimulus to be effective, it is also possible that each context would require different stimulus characteristics. For example, noisy environments might need less complex stimulus type (e.g. highly familiar images or short words), longer presentation duration or presentations at less peripheral vision areas (e.g. parafoveal or near-peripheral vision) compared to quiet environments. Therefore, it is essential for future work to examine these differences and study how the type of context could impact the efficiency of subliminal techniques.

Type of task. As presented earlier, we foresee the use of subliminal techniques in various use-case scenarios such as providing notifications and hints as well as encouraging behavioural changes while performing primary tasks. These tasks range from attentionally demanding tasks such as driving to tasks that require less attentional demands such as browsing the web. While the work presented in this paper provides generalised knowledge that could be applied regardless of the type of the task, it is possible that the type of task (primary and secondary) would impact the effectiveness of the subliminal stimuli. For example, primary tasks that are cognitively demanding might require different characteristics of subliminal stimulus for each secondary task (e.g. provide notifications and encourage behaviour change). Stimulus in this case could always be of very short presentation durations (to eliminate any additional cognitive demands on the primary task) but with different stimulus type for each secondary task (e.g. Graphical stimulus for notifications and textual for behaviour change). On the other hand, less demanding primary tasks, might also need different stimulus characteristics for each secondary task, compared to the highly demanding primary tasks. Further work is needed to explore these differences and understand how they can be used in tasks with varying levels of cognitive demands.

Type of Technology. The investigation we present in this paper focuses on large display setups that extend to  60
 of visual angle at 70 cm viewing distance. These large display setups include multi-monitor setups, large displays, heap-up displays or head-mounted displays. It is possible that each type of these large displays might require different subliminal stimulus characteristics. For instance, in order for the subliminal stimulus to be effective, multi-monitor setups might require longer presentation durations than the head-mounted displays and Virtual Reality applications. Also, different stimulus types (i.e. Graphical or textual) could show different effectiveness levels depending on the technology. For example, in multi-monitor setups both graphical and textual stimuli might be effective, whereas in head-mounted and head-up displays, graphical stimuli could be more suitable since most of the shown information in these setups is graphical and the user could be more attentive to such stimuli. While we looked in detail into one of these technologies, future efforts should be directed towards exploring these technologies in order to advance our understanding of how subliminal techniques can support users.

We believe that future examination of these aspects would provide a more solid knowledge into the use of subliminal techniques in user interfaces, which would allow researchers to propose comprehensive guidelines on how they can be used.

7. Conclusion
Subliminal techniques have been used to enrich and improve interactions between humans and computers. However, the extent to which subliminal techniques are effective at influencing decisions when presented out of the central visual area is unclear. In addition, it remains unclear whether the different visual stimulus types differ in how they affect decisions if presented peripherally. In this article, we explore and compare subliminal stimulus types when presented in peripheral areas and investigate the visual limits of the priming effect. In particular, we study the selection performance of three stimulus types (images, shapes, words) presented at thirteen visual angles and examined using two presentation durations. Our results showed significant differences in success rates at many peripheral locations in textual subliminal stimuli. Types comparison results showed differences between types at specific angles in which the word stimulus have showed better performance compared to other types. The key contributions of this article are two-part. First, we provide empirical evidence that subliminal stimuli can be effective at peripheral vision areas. Second, we compare three subliminal stimulus types when presented in peripheral areas. This work provides useful insights into understanding peripheral subliminal techniques and how they can be used to support users during their main tasks in user interfaces.
