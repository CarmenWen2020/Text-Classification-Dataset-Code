Abstract
To address the fault diagnosis problem in hybrid fault circumstances in which both node and link faults may happen, Q. Zhu et al. propose the HPMC model. As the generalizations of the diagnosability under the PMC model, h-restricted vertex diagnosability and r-restricted edge diagnosability can evaluate the fault diagnosis capability of multiprocessor systems under the HPMC model. In this paper, we provide a more precise characterization for the hybrid fault diagnosis capability of multiprocessor systems by studying the h-restricted vertex diagnosability and r-restricted edge diagnosability of a class of interconnection networks. As applications, these two parameters of various networks are established under the HPMC model.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, semiconductor technology has made rapid progress, some supercomputers even have millions of processors. With so many processors included in a multiprocessor system, it's inevitable that some processors or links may become faulty during a period. Therefore, reliability and fault diagnosis capability evaluation are important to the design and maintenance of large multiprocessor systems. Interconnection networks can be utilized to model multiprocessor systems by using vertices to represent processors and edges to represent links between processors. By studying some parameters of interconnection networks, fault tolerance ability and fault diagnosis capability of the corresponding multiprocessor systems can be evaluated. These results may be valuable in choosing which interconnection network to use for a particular multiprocessor system. In the following we will use multiprocessor systems and interconnection networks interchangeably.

In the fault diagnosis of multiprocessor systems, system-level diagnosis is an important approach. It is the process of discriminating among faulty nodes and fault-free nodes in a system. There are several well-known diagnosis models that have different definitions of tests and different assumptions on test results. The PMC model, proposed by F.P. Preparata, G. Metze and R. Chien [3], is the most widely studied model in system-level diagnosis. Under the PMC model, it is assumed that a test  includes two adjacent processors: the tester u and the testee v. As to the test results, it is assumed that the result is reliable if and only if the tester is fault-free. That is, if a tester is fault-free then its test results are correct, and if a node is faulty then its test result may be correct or incorrect.

In the study of fault diagnosis of multiprocessor systems, fault diagnosis capability evaluation is an extremely important research area. Given a diagnosis model, a system is called t-diagnosable if all the faulty nodes can be guaranteed to be located provided that the number of faulty nodes does not exceed t. The diagnosability of a multiprocessor system G is the maximum integer t which makes G t-diagnosable, denoted by . It is a key parameter to evaluate the fault diagnosis capability of multiprocessor systems. The diagnosability of a system is upper bounded by its minimum degree. However, in the actual multiprocessor systems, many fault circumstances rarely occur. Motivated by the deficiency of the classical measurement of diagnosability, some new parameters have been proposed, such as conditional diagnosability [1], -diagnosability [6], g-good-neighbor conditional diagnosability [20] and g-extra conditional diagnosability [15]. By now, study on these parameters of many interconnection networks have been investigated. For example, G. Chen, L. Ming and W. Bo [4] determined the conditional diagnosability of exchanged crossed cube; W. Yin and J.R. Liang [18] determined the g-good neighbor local diagnosability of a hypercube network under the PMC model; J.R. Liang, Q. Zhang, H. Li [7] studied the structural properties and -diagnosis for star networks under the PMC model; E.Q. Zhu, C.J. Liu, Q. Zhang, et al. [2] studied the reliability and diagnosability of bijective connection networks.

Under the PMC model, it is assumed that only node faults can occur. However, both node and link faults may occur in actual circumstances. Q. Zhu et al. [13] proposed the h-edge tolerable diagnosability of hypercubes under PMC model and MM* model. As a new fault diagnosis parameter, h-edge tolerable diagnosability can measure the fault diagnosis capability of multiprocessor systems with both node and link faults may occur. So, h-edge tolerable diagnosability has attracted the attention of many peoples. Y.L. Wei and M. Xu [19] determined the h-edge tolerable diagnosability of regular graphs under the PMC model and MM* model. Then H. Zhang and J.X. Meng [5] determined the h-edge tolerable diagnosability of k-regular 2-cn graphs under the PMC model. However, h-edge tolerable diagnosability only considers a few cases of hybrid fault circumstances.

In order to better measure the fault diagnosis capability in hybrid fault circumstances, Q. Zhu et al. [12] introduced the Hybrid PMC fault model (HPMC model). Under the HPMC model, a test involves two adjacent processors and the link between them. It is considered that the test result is reliable if and only if the tester is fault-free. The link between tester and testee is referred to as the test link. When the tester is good, the test result is 0 if and only if both the testee and the test link are fault-free. If the tester is faulty, the test result may be 0 or 1 irrelevant to the status of the testee and the test link. Under the HPMC model, the h-restricted vertex diagnosability and r-restricted edge diagnosability are used to measure the fault diagnosis capability of interconnection networks. They can view as a generalization of the diagnosability under the PMC model. In this paper, we explored that h-restricted vertex diagnosability and r-restricted edge diagnosability of a special class of interconnection networks. As applications, the h-restricted vertex diagnosability and r-restricted edge diagnosability of k-ary n-cubes, star graphs, BC networks, exchanged hypercubes are determined under the HPMC model.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces some definitions and terminologies of HPMC model. In section 3, we determine the h-restricted vertex diagnosability and r-restricted edge diagnosability of a class of interconnection networks. In section 4, applying the results of section 3 to k-ary n-cubes, star graphs, BC networks and exchanged hypercubes to obtain their corresponding h-restricted vertex diagnosability and r-restricted edge diagnosability. Section 5 summarizes the contributions of this paper.

2. Preliminaries
Given a simple undirected graph  where  and  are used to denote the vertex set and edge set of G respectively. For an edge e with  as its end-vertices, we use uv to denoted e and call  are adjacent to each other and e is incident to both u and v. Given a vertex u in G, we use  to denote the set of all its adjacent vertices in G. For , the degree of u, written by , is the number of edges incident with u. Let  denote the minimum degree of the vertices of G. The symmetric difference of two vertex sets  and  is defined as the set . The cn-number of two vertices  is equal to the number of their common neighbors, denoted by . Let .

Now we introduce the HPMC model. In the HPMC model, it is assumed that a test  involves two adjacent nodes  and the edge  between them, in which u is called the tester, v is called the testee and e is called the test edge. There are two assumptions under the HPMC model: (1) The links incident with any faulty nodes are good; (2) The test result of a good tester is reliable and test result of a faulty tester is unreliable. Thus we have where F is the set of faulty nodes and S is the set of faulty edges.

Given a multiprocessor system G,  is a consistent faulty pair of G if all vertices in F cannot be incident to any edge in S. Under the HPMC model, if the syndrome σ can arise in the circumstance that all vertices in F and all edges in S are faulty and all the other vertices and edges are faulty-free, then the syndrome σ is said to be consistent to a faulty pair . Since the test result of a faulty tester is unreliable, syndromes consistent with a faulty pair  may not be unique. Two faulty pairs  and  are distinguishable if and only if . Otherwise, they are indistinguishable.

Under the HPMC model, we usually measure the hybrid fault diagnosis capability of interconnection networks by h-restricted vertex diagnosability and r-restricted edge diagnosability.

Definition 2.1

[12] Let  be two natural numbers, a multiprocessor system G is -diagnosable if and only if any two distinct faulty pairs  and  with  and  are distinguishable.

Definition 2.2

[12] Given a multiprocessor system G and two integers h and r, the h-restricted vertex diagnosability of G is the maximum integer t such that G is -diagnosable, denoted by . Similarly, the r-restricted edge diagnosability of G is the maximum integer s such that G is -diagnosable, denoted by .

The following lemma characterizes two distinguishable faulty pairs under the HPMC model, which is important to locate faulty nodes and faulty links in a multiprocessor system.

Lemma 2.3
