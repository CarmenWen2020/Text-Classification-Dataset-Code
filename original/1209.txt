Abstract
The connectivity of a connected graph G is the minimum cardinality over all vertex-cuts, which can be determined using Menger's theorem (1927). Then G is super connected if its minimum vertex-cut is always composed of a vertex's neighborhood. Two generalized extensions to this classic notion of connectivity include the T-structure connectivity  and the T-substructure connectivity , for which T is the given structure isomorphic to a connected subgraph of G. Let

 denote the union of the set of all connected subgraphs of T and the set of the trivial graph. In this article, a connected graph G is called super T-connected if the minimum degree of  is zero for each minimum T-cut F of G; analogously, G is super 
⁎
-connected if the minimum degree of  is zero for each minimum 
⁎
-cut F of G. Considering the n-dimensional locally twisted cube  with , we first establish both  and  and then determine whether  is super T-connected and super

1. Introduction
Interconnection networks serve as the backbone of high-performance computing [13], [18], [32]. Efficient interconnection networks support high-speed data communication and achieve a qualified level of fault-tolerant capability, referring to [1], [4], [9], [30] for some examples. The network's topological structure is typically modeled by a connected graph for mathematical analysis [2]. A graph  consists of a vertex set V and an edge set E. For convenience,  and  represent the vertex and edge sets of G, respectively. Two vertices x and y of G are neighbors of each other if there is an edge  joining them in G. For any vertex x of G, 
 is the neighborhood of x; for , 
. The minimum degree of G is defined by 
. A graph 
 is a subgraph of G if 
 and 
. For any ,  denotes the subgraph induced by S. Paths and cycles are two types of fundamental subgraphs. For clarity, 
 represents a path of order , and 
 represents a cycle of order , in both of which any two consecutive vertices are adjacent.

A graph G is connected if for every pair  of distinct vertices of G, there exists a path between u and v. A vertex-cut of G is a subset S of  such that  is disconnected or trivial. When it comes to the cardinality of a vertex-cut, the connectivity of G is defined as 
, which is equal to the minimum cardinality over all vertex-cuts of G and can be determined in polynomial time using Menger's theorem [27]. It has long been one of the most important factors that characterize both graph connectedness and reliability. Harary [8] proposed the ρ-conditional connectivity  as a generic extension to the classical connectivity, for which ρ specifies a graph-theoretic condition with respect to G. Known examples of conditional connectivity include the g-extra connectivity [6] and the h-restricted connectivity [5]. A vertex subset  is a g-extra vertex subset if every component of  has more than g vertices; S is an h-restricted vertex subset if . Then S turns out to be a g-extra (or an h-restricted) vertex-cut of G if  is disconnected. The g-extra connectivity 
 of G is the minimum cardinality over all g-extra vertex cuts of G, and the h-restricted connectivity 
 of G is the minimum cardinality over all h-restricted vertex-cuts of G. By definition, the equality 
 follows.

For a connected graph G, a subgraph-cut F of G is a set of vertex subsets of G such that  is disconnected or trivial. Suppose that T is any connected graph and 
⁎
 denotes the union of the set of all connected subgraphs of T and the set of the trivial graph. Then a subgraph-cut F of G is called a T-cut if for each , a spanning subgraph of  is isomorphic to T; analogously, F is called a 
⁎
-cut if for each , a spanning subgraph of  is isomorphic to one of 
⁎
. The T-structure (respectively, T-substructure) connectivity of G, denoted by  (respectively, 
), is the minimum cardinality over all T-cuts (respectively, 
⁎
-cut) of G. For the binary n-cube 
, Lin et al. [22] established both 
 and 
 if 
, where 
 denotes an r-star structure for ; for the k-ary n-cube 
, Lv et al. [23] established both 
 and 
 if 
. Later, Sabir and Meng [31] and Mane [26] proceeded to study this kind of structured-fault tolerance with respect to hypercubes and/or folded hypercubes. Some recent studies can be referred to in [19], [20], [28].

A graph G is super connected if its minimum vertex-cut is always composed of the neighborhood of a vertex . Given a structure T, G is super T-connected if  for each minimum T-cut F of G; analogously, G is super 
⁎
-connected if  for each minimum 
⁎
-cut F of G. It is well known that the locally twisted cube [34], which is a hypercube variant with lower diameter than that of the hypercube, has proved super connected [3], [12]. Many attractive properties of the locally twisted cube have been widely studied [7], [14], [15], [16], [24], [25], [29], [35]. For example, cycle and path embedding can reach high flexibility on locally twisted cubes [15], [16], [17]. This article is inspired to discover whether the locally twisted cube is super T-connected and super 
⁎
-connected for 
.

The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces some topological properties of locally twisted cubes. Sections 3, 4 and 5 address the main contributions of this article. Finally, Section 6 draws some concluding remarks.

Case 1:

.

Case 2: 
. We assume that

Subcase 2.1: . Since

(iii)
. For , let

Subcase 2.2: . Let , where v is a common neighbor of u and w. Below we take two possibilities into account.

(i)
. Thus, . As F contains totally 16 vertices, C cannot be isolated in 
, causing a contradiction.

(ii)
. Thus, . Because F is the minimum 
⁎
-cut of

(b)
If

, causing a contradiction.

Subcase 2.3: . It follows from Lemma 2 that 
. However, F contains only 16 vertices, so we get a contradiction that C cannot be composed of four or more vertices.

By contradiction, C must be a singleton, and thus

-connected and super 
⁎
-connected. □
