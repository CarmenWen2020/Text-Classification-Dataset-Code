Abstract
A two-terminal graph  is a simple and undirected graph with two specified target vertices s and t in V. In G, if each edge survives independently with a fixed probability p, the two-terminal reliability is the probability that two target vertices are connected. A two-terminal graph is uniformly most reliable if its reliability is not less than the reliability of any other graph with same number of vertices and edges for all p. Betrand et al. proved that there is no uniformly most reliable two-terminal graph if either  and  or  and . In this paper, we further prove that there is no uniformly most reliable two-terminal graph if  and  in a different way.

1. Introduction
Network reliability is an important area of research in network science, graph theory and combinatorial mathematics. Graph theoretic model is a powerful tool to study network reliability. Now, some relevant concepts are listed. Here we only consider undirected and simple graphs. The complement of a graph G is denoted by 
. The degree of a vertex v in a graph, denoted by , is the number of its neighbors, and  denotes the minimum degree of any vertex in graph G. A regular graph is a graph where each vertex has the same degree and a quasi-regular graph is a graph in which the degrees of any two vertices differ by at most 1. Let  be the disjoint union of graphs G and H. If ℓ is a positive integer, then  denotes the disjoint union of ℓ copies G. Let 
 denote the number of subgraphs (not necessarily induced) isomorphic to H in G. Let 
, 
 and 
 respectively denote the path, the cycle and the complete graph on n vertices. For a graph G and a subset S of V, let  be the subgraph of G obtained by deleting the vertices of S and the edges incident with them. An edge-cutset of graph H is a set of edges whose removal disconnects H, and let 
 be the number of edge-cutsets of size i in H. The edge connectivity of H is the smallest size of an edge-cutset of H, denoted by  or simply λ. For a graph H, let  be the number of the components in H. For other notations and terminologies not explained here we refer to [7].

One of the hot issues of network reliability is known as the two-terminal network reliability problem. Generally, people are interested in computing the network reliability in relation to the connecting paths between two specific network vertices. More formally, a two-terminal graph  is a simple and undirected graph with two specified target vertices s and t in V. In G, if each edge operates independently with a fixed probability p, the two-terminal reliability is the probability that two target vertices are connected. Besides two-terminal reliability, the all-terminal reliability has also been extensively studied.

Let  be the set of all-terminal graphs on n vertices and m edges. Let 
 be the set of two-terminal graphs on n vertices and m edges. Let G be a graph in 
. An st-pathset of G is a subset of E containing a path from s to t. Let 
 be the number of st-pathsets of size i () in G. Thus, the two-terminal reliability polynomial (i.e., the probability that there is a path from s to t) of 
 can be written as
 
 An st-cutset of G is a subset of E whose removal disconnects vertices s and t. Let 
 be the number of st-cutsets containing i () edges, if there is no path from s to t in G, then let 
. The two-terminal unreliability polynomial (i.e., the probability that there is no path from s to t) of G is defined as
 
 In addition, for a two-terminal graph G, the st-edge connectivity in G is the smallest size of an st-cutset of G, denoted by 
 or simply 
.

Obviously, in any subgraph with i edges of G, the two target vertices s and t are either connected or disconnected, so  
  is equal to the number of st-pathsets of size i plus the number of st-cutsets of size , it follows that  
 
, and
 
 
 

For 
, G is a locally most reliable two-terminal graph for  (, resp.) if there is an  such that 
 for all 
 and for all  (, resp.). Furthermore, G is a uniformly most reliable two-terminal graph if 
 for all  and all 
.

In the past decades, there are lots of results on network reliability, which are partly mentioned in [8]. This research on reliability mainly focuses on the algorithms for computing the reliability polynomials of all-terminal networks and the existence of uniformly most reliable all-terminal graphs, see [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [9], [11], [13], [14], [15], [16], [18]. Although there is some research on two-terminal networks [4], [10], [17], there are only a few results on uniformly most reliable two-terminal graphs.

In 2020, Brown et al. [10] studied the existence of uniformly most reliable two-terminal graphs with an additional restriction that the distance between the target vertices is either no more than two or at least three for vertex failures while edges and target vertices are completely reliable. In 2018, Betrand et al. [4] studied the existence of uniformly most reliable two-terminal graph for edge failures while vertices are completely reliable. They proved that there is no uniformly most reliable two-terminal graph if either  and  or  and  
  
 . On the other hand, if  
 , there exists a uniformly most reliable two-terminal graph in 
. For the number of edges m in the interval  
 , the existence of uniformly most reliable two-terminal graphs for edge failures while vertices are completely reliable is still unsolved.

Our goal is to solve the problem. In this article we show that for  and  
 , there is no uniformly most reliable two-terminal graph in 
. The proof technique is based on a simple fact that if G is a uniformly most reliable two-terminal graph, then it is a locally most reliable two-terminal graph both for  and for . Thus, we shall first characterize the locally most reliable two-terminal graphs for  and for  separately. Then we show that the locally most reliable two-terminal graphs for  are not consistent with the locally most reliable two-terminal graphs for .

For 
, let , 
 and 
. If G and H are disjoint, we can obtain the join of G and H, denoted by , by starting with a disjoint union of G and H and adding edges joining every vertex of G to every vertex of H.

Theorem 1

Let n and m be two positive integers such that . Suppose that G is a locally most reliable two-terminal graph in 
 for .

(1)
If  
 , then 
, i.e., remove a 
 between non-target vertices from the complete graph.

(2)
If  
 , then 
, i.e., remove a triangle between non-target vertices from the complete graph.

(3)
If  
  
 , then 
 .

(4)
If  
 , then 
, where 
 is neither a regular graph nor a quasi-regular graph.

Theorem 2

For positive integers n, m with  and  
 , let G be the locally most reliable two-terminal graph in 
 for . Then, the following are true.

(1)
If  is an integer, then 
, where 
 is a regular graph. In particular, when , 
.

(2)
If  is not an integer, then 
, where 
 is a quasi-regular graph. In particular, when  
  
 , 
 , i.e., remove a matching between non-target vertices from the complete graph.

Our main result is as follows.

Theorem 3

For  and  
 , there is no uniformly most reliable two-terminal graph in 
.

Proof

Suppose, for a contradiction, that G is the uniformly most reliable graph in 
. Then G is a locally most reliable graph both for  and .

By Theorem 1, for , we see that 
  for  
  
 , 
 for  
 , and 
 for  
 . Obviously, there must be two non-target vertices in G whose degree difference is more than 1. By Theorem 1, we also have 
 and 
 is neither a regular graph nor a quasi-regular graph for  
 . So, by Theorem 1, it is obvious that for  
 , there must be two non-target vertices in G whose degree difference is more than 1.

On the other hand, by Theorem 2, for , 
 and 
 is either a regular graph or a quasi-regular graph, which implies that the degree difference between any two non-target vertices in G is no more than 1. This is a contradiction.

Thus, there is no uniformly most reliable two-terminal graph in 
. □

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we prove Theorem 1, in Section 3 we prove Theorem 2 and a conclusion is given in Section 4.

2. Proof of Theorem 1
In order to prove Theorem 1, some definitions and known results from previous work are listed first. Let Y be the set of all vertices of maximum degree in G. For a subset 
 of Y with y vertices and a positive integer z, we can construct a new graph, denoted by , by starting with a disjoint union of G and 
 and adding edges joining every vertex of 
 to every vertex of 
.

Lemma 1

[4]
Let 
 be two-terminal graphs. If there exists an integer k so that 
 for  and 
, then when , 
.

Lemma 2

[12]
Let  be the graph with the maximum value of

Lemma 3

[12]
For a graph , the values of

Lemma 4

[4]
If

 containing the edge st.

Let 
 be the set of all graphs in 
 containing the edge st and all edges of the forms 
 and 
 for . By Lemma 4, if  
 , every locally most reliable graph for  must belong to 
. Furthermore, every graph in 
 has the same coefficients 
, 
, 
, of the two-terminal reliability polynomial. Thus, in order to find the locally most reliable graph for , it is necessary to compare the coefficients 
 ().

Lemma 5

Let  be two graphs in 
. If one of the following conditions holds,

(1)
;

(2)
, and either

(i)
 or

(ii)
,

then when , 
.
Proof

It is easy to see that 
. Clearly, 
 for .

Now, consider 
 and 
. We proceed according to the distance of s and t in an st-pathset of size 4. If the distance is 1, the edge st must be included along with any other three edges. Thus there are  
  st-pathsets in this case. If the distance is 2 which means the edge st is not in the st-pathset, there is a vertex 
 such that 
 and 
 are in st-pathset. Thus there are  
  
  
  st-pathsets in this case. If the distance is 3, there must be an edge 
 such that together with 
 and 
 are in st-pathset. Thus there are  
  
  
  st-pathsets in this case. If the distance is 4, there must be a 
 such that the two endpoints 
 and 
 of 
 satisfy 
, 
 and 
 are in the st-pathset. Thus there are 
 st-pathsets in this case. Thus, we have
  
  
 
 Similarly,
  
  
 
 Hence,

If 
, then 
. By Lemma 1, 
 for . If 
, then 
.

Let's further consider 
 and 
 according to the distance of s and t in an st-pathset of size 5. Similar to 
, if the distance is 1, the number of st-pathsets of size 5 in this case is  
 . If the distance is 2, there are  
  
  
  
  st-pathsets in this case. If the distance is 3, there are  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  st-pathsets in this case. If the distance is 4, there are  
  
  
  
  
  
  st-pathsets in this case. If the distance is 5, there must be a 
 such that the two endpoints 
 and 
 of 
 satisfy 
, 
 and 
 are in the st-pathset. Thus there are  
  
  st-pathsets in this case. Thus, we have
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 

Obviously, the calculation method of 
 is similar to that of 
, and because 
, we have,

If 
, then 
. By Lemma 1, 
 for .

Since 
, by Lemma 3, we have
 
 

Similarly, we can calculate 
, so, we have,

If 
, then 
. By Lemma 1, 
 for .

We complete the proof. □

By Lemma 5, in order to find the locally most reliable two-terminal graph for  when  
 , it is necessary to find the extremal graphs with the maximum 
 among all graphs in 
. If there is more than one such graph, then find graphs either in these obtained graphs with the maximum difference between the number of 
 and three times the number of 
 among non-target vertices, or in the complement graphs of these obtained graphs with the minimum difference between the number of 
 and three times the number of 
 among non-target vertices.

According to [12], the extremal graphs with the maximum number of 
 in all-terminal graphs are described as six classes.

Lemma 6

[12]
If H is a graph with the maximum number 
 in , then H belongs to at least one of the following six classes:

(1)

  when ;

(2)

  when ;

(3)

Lemma 7

 , let G be the locally most reliable graph in 
 for . Then 
, and

Proof

By Lemma 4, we have

 in . By Lemma 6,

. □

Next, we first assume that G is the locally most reliable two-terminal graph for , then according to Lemma 2, Lemma 4, Lemma 5, Lemma 7, the structure of G is characterized.

Proof of Theorem 1

Let G be the locally most reliable graph in 
 for , then according to range of the edge numbers m, we distinguish two cases to prove Theorem 1.

Case 1.  
  
 

By Lemma 4, we see that 
. By Lemma 5, it is easy to see that 
 for all 
. Clearly, 
 and  
 
 .

When 
 , by Lemma 2, 
, so, if  
  
 , then 
  and if  
 , then 
.

When 
 , by Lemma 2,

 or 
. For convenience, let 
 and 
. Since 
 () is dense, it is easy to compute the number of 
 and 
 in 
. Note that 
, and 
. By Lemma 5, we get that 
 for 
 , so 
.

Case 2.  
 

By Lemma 4, we see that 
. By Lemma 7, 
. Since , it is obvious that 
 
 
 
.

By the structure of 
, if , then 
 and 
  
 
 
 
 
 
, which contradicts 
 
 
, so . Thus there is at least one isolated vertex and a vertex with degree i in 
. If , then  and 
 , which contradicts 
, so  and there exist two vertices whose degrees' difference is more than 1.

By the structure of 
, if , then there is at least two vertices with degree  and  in 
, respectively. And if , then the degree difference between the two vertices is ; if , then , otherwise 
 and 
  
 
 
 
 
 
, which contradicts 
 
 
. So if , there exist two vertices whose degrees' difference is . On the other hand, if , then there is at least two vertices with degree  and  in 
, respectively, which means that the degree difference between the two vertices is l. Since 
 , there must exist two vertices whose degrees' difference is more than 1.

According to the structure of 
, and by ranges of parameters  and ℓ, there must be vertices of degree  and k in graph 
. The difference of these two vertices is . In 
 and 
, by the similarly reasons as 
, there exist two vertices whose degrees difference are also more than 1.

Therefore, there must be two vertices in 
 whose degree difference is more than 1, which means that 
 is neither a regular graph nor a quasi-regular graph.

In summary, we conclude that 
 and 
 is neither a regular graph nor a quasi-regular graph.

From the above argument, we complete the proof. □

3. Proof of Theorem 2
In order to prove Theorem 2, some lemmas are listed first.

Lemma 8

Let

 for  and 
, then when , 
.

Proof

The two-terminal unreliability polynomial of G is 
 
. Let , then 
 
. Similarly, we have 
 
. Since , . And because there exists an integer ℓ so that 
 for  and 
. So, by Lemma 1, it is obvious that when , 
, i.e., when , 
. □

Lemma 9

[4]
If G is a locally most reliable graph in 
 for , it must have the largest st-edge connectivity 
.

By Lemma 9, the first step to search for the locally most reliable graph for  when  and  
  should find the class of two-terminal graphs whose st-edge connectivity 
 attains the maximum in 
.

Lemma 10

Giving a positive integer m,  
 , let 
, then 
 and the equation holds if and only if 
.

Proof

Assume that G satisfies the given condition. It is easy to see that 
. Since G is a simple graph, we have  and . Obviously, we get 
.

If 
, then . Now, s and t are adjacent with every vertex in  besides itself. Hence, 
.

On the other side, if 
, let C be an st-cutset of G, then there are at least two components in  containing the target vertices s and t, respectively. Suppose there are  () vertices in the component which are the target vertex s and k non-target vertices of . Thus,  and 
. Since 
, 
. □

There are lots of graphs in 
. By Lemma 8, in order to construct the locally most reliable two-terminal graph for , we need to compare the coefficients 
.

Proposition 1

Let 
, then 
.

Proof

Since 
, by Lemma 10, we have 
. Let C be an st-cutset of G, then s, t are in different components of . Suppose that the component containing s, denoted by 
, has k () non-target vertices 
 (
, ). By calculation, we have
 
 
 where 
 is the number of edges between these k non-target vertices in 
.

Clearly, . If 
, then 
 
, which implies that vertices in 
 are not adjacent with vertices in 
. Hence, the number of 
, which is denoted by 
, is corresponding with components of 
. Then, by calculation,
  
  
 
 □

Corollary 1

Let 
. If 
, then 
 for .

Proof

Since 
, by Proposition 1, we have, 
 and 
.

So, if 
, then 
. By Lemma 8, 
, which implies that, 
 for . □

Corollary 1 implies that, the locally most reliable graph G for  is the graph whose non-target vertices induced subgraph has minimum components in 
. Since  
 , we have 
, which confirm the non-target vertices induced subgraph is connected and 
.

Let 
 be the class of graphs whose non-target vertices induced subgraph is connected in 
. There are many graphs in 
 when  
 . To find the locally most reliable graphs for , we continue to compare the coefficients of unreliability polynomial of graphs in 
.

Proposition 2

For a positive integer m, where  
 , let 
. If 
 or 
 but 
, then 
 for .

Proof

Let 
. It is easy to see that 
. By Lemma 9, Lemma 10, Proposition 1 and Corollary 1, we have 
, and 
. We need to compute the subsequent coefficients of 
, where 
 and .

Let 
 be the st-cutset of size a and the minimal st-cutset of size b, where 
. Using the same method as the proof of Proposition 1, there are ℓ edges connecting non-target vertices, which are in the component containing s in 
, and other non-target vertices. Suppose that 
 (), then we see that 
 and the number of the selection of the minimal st-cutset of size 
 is corresponding with 
.

Clearly, if 
, then 
 (). By calculation,
 
 
 
 
 Similarly, we have 
 , (
), and 
 
.

If 
, assuming 
, then 
 , where 
. But 
  and 
 
. Obviously, 
.

If 
 but 
, then 
 , where 
. But 
 
 and 
 
. Obviously, 
.

Thus, if 
 or 
 but 
, then by Lemma 8, we see that for , 
, that is, 
.

In conclusion, the proposition holds. □

Proposition 2 implies that the locally most reliable graph G for  is the graph whose non-target vertices induced subgraph has maximum edge connectivity λ in 
, and when λ reaches the maximum, the number of edge-cutsets of size λ is the smallest, i.e., 
 is a max λ-min 
 graph in .

Lemma 11

[3]
For , if H is max λ in , then  and 
, where 
 denotes the number of vertices with degree λ in H. If there exists a max λ graph H having 
 min 
, then min 
 min 
 and the additional property that every minimum edge-cutset isolates a vertex, where min 
 denotes the minimum number of vertices of degree λ in graph taken over the class of all max λ graphs.

Next, we first assume that G is the locally most reliable two-terminal graph for . According to Lemma 9, Lemma 11, Corollary 1 and Proposition 2, the structure of G is determined.

Proof of Theorem 2

Let G be the locally most reliable graph in 
 for , then by Lemma 9, Lemma 10 and Corollary 1, we obtain 
, 
 and 
 is a connected graph.

By Proposition 2, we need to search the maximum edge connectivity graphs in , and 
 is minimum among these graphs, which implies that 
 is a max λ-min 
 graph.

Then, by Lemma 11, we see that 
, and the max λ-min 
 graph has the minimum number of vertices with degree 
 in graphs with maximum λ.

Thus, if  is an integer, then 
 is regular, otherwise there exists a vertex whose degree is less than 
, a contradiction. So, 
, where 
 is a regular graph. If  is not an integer, then 
 is quasi-regular. So, 
, where 
 is a quasi-regular graph.

In particular, when , since the connected 2-regular graph is a cycle, 
 is 
, so 
. When  
  
 , a quasi-regular graph is a complete graph with a matching removed, which means that 
 is a complete graph with a matching removed. So, 
 

The proof is completed. □
