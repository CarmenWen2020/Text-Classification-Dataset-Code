Abstract
A radio labeling of a graph G is a mapping f :  → {0, 1, 2,...} such that  holds for every pair of vertices u and v, where  is the diameter of G and  is the distance between u and v in G. The radio number of G, denoted by , is the smallest t such that G admits a radio labeling with . A block graph is a graph such that each block (induced maximal 2-connected subgraph) is a complete graph. In this paper, a lower bound for the radio number of block graphs is established. The block graph which achieves this bound is called a lower bound block graph. We prove three necessary and sufficient conditions for lower bound block graphs. Moreover, we give three sufficient conditions for a graph to be a lower bound block graph. Using these results, we present several families of lower bound block graphs, including the level-wise regular block graphs and the extended star of blocks. The line graph of a graph  has  as the vertex set, where two vertices are adjacent if they are incident edges in G. We extend our results to trees as trees and its line graphs are block graphs. We prove that if a tree is a lower bound block graph then, under certain conditions, its line graph is also a lower bound block graph, and vice versa. Consequently, we show that the line graphs of many known lower bound trees, excluding paths, are lower bound block graphs.

1. Introduction
The radio labeling is motivated by the channel assignment introduced by Hale [10]. The task is to assign channels to some given transmitters or stations such that the interference is avoided and the spectrum of the channels used is minimized. The interference between two transmitters is closely related to the proximity of the locations, the closer the location the stronger the interference might occur. In order to avoid stronger interference, the larger their separation in assigned frequencies must be.

In a graph model of the channel assignment, the transmitters are represented by vertices, and two transmitters are connected by an edge if they are close to each other. The distance between two vertices  in G, denoted by , is the length of a shortest -path. The diameter of G, denoted by , is the maximum distance between two vertices in G. A radio k-labeling is a function  such that the following holds for all :(1) The span of a radio k-labeling f, denoted by , is the . The radio-k-number, denoted by 
, is the minimum span of a radio k-labeling admitted by G.

When , a radio 2-labeling is known as distance two labeling or -labeling. In this special case, 
 is termed as the λ-number of graph G denoted by . The -labeling has been studied extensively over the past years (cf. [8], [12]). For more details and bibliographic references, the readers are referred to surveys by Calamoneri [3] and by Yeh [26].

In this paper, we focus on another special case when . The radio -labeling is known as the radio labeling of G. In this case, 
 is denoted by . Introduced by Chartrand et al. [4], [5], radio labeling has been studied extensively in the past two decades (cf. [1], [2], [4], [5], [7], [15], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [23], [24], [25], [27], [28]). The radio number of cycles and paths were determined by Liu and Zhu [17]. Khennoufa and Togni [13] studied the radio number for hypercubes by using generalized binary Gray codes. Martinez et al. [18] investigated the radio number of generalized prism graphs. Niedzialomski [20] studied radio graceful graphs (where G admits a surjective radio labeling) and showed that the Cartesian product of t copies of a complete graph is radio graceful for certain t, providing infinitely many examples of radio graceful graphs of arbitrary diameter. For two positive integers , the toroidal grid 
 is the Cartesian product of cycles 
 and 
, 
. Morris et al. [19] determined 
, and Saha and Panigrahi [22] determined 
 when .

The radio number for trees has been investigated by many authors. Liu [15] proved a general lower bound of the radio number for trees and characterized the spiders (trees with at most one vertex of degree greater than 2) whose radio numbers achieve this bound. We call trees whose radio numbers achieve this bound as lower bound trees. Many families of trees have been shown to be lower bound trees, including complete level-wise regular trees without degree 2 vertices (Halász and Tuza [9]), complete m-ary trees with  (Li et al. [14]), and banana trees and firecrackers trees (Bantva et al. [1], [2]). Most recently, this lower bound has been improved by Liu, Saha, and Das [16] for non-lower-bound trees.

The aim of this article is to extend the study on trees to block graphs. For a graph G, a 2-connected induced subgraph of G, denoted by 
, is a subgraph induced by the vertex set 
, where 
 does not contain any cut-vertex. We call 
 maximal if  is not a 2-connected induced subgraph of G for any superset 
. A block graph is a graph whose maximal 2-connected induced subgraphs are complete graphs (cliques). Obviously, a tree is a block graph. Generalizing the approach used in [15] we prove a general lower bound for the radio number of block graphs (Theorem 3.1). A block graph whose radio number is equal to this bound is called a lower bound block graph. We prove three necessary and sufficient conditions for lower bound block graphs (Theorem 3.1, Theorem 3.2, Theorem 3.3). Moreover, three sufficient conditions have been derived for a block graph to be a lower bound block graph (Theorem 3.4).

Applying these results, in Section 4, we present two families of lower bound block graphs, namely, the level-wise regular block graphs and the extended star of blocks. In Section 5, we discuss relations between the radio numbers of a tree and its line graph (both are block graphs). In particular, we prove sufficient conditions for lower bound trees so that their line graphs are lower bound block graphs, and vice versa. These results imply that the line graphs of the above mentioned known lower bound trees (complete level-wise regular trees without degree 2 vertices, complete m-ary trees, , banana trees, and firecrackers trees, etc.) are all lower bound block graphs.

2. Preliminaries
This section is aimed to provide preliminaries needed for the advancement of discussion. The distance between two vertices u and v in a graph G, written as 
, is the length of a shortest path between u and v. We denote 
 by  when G is clear in the context. A -path with length  is called a -geodesic. The diameter of a graph G, denoted by , is the maximum  among all pairs of vertices.

Let G be a simple graph. A vertex  is called a cut-vertex if its deletion increases the number of components of G. A graph is 2-connected if it does not have any cut-vertices. A block of G is a maximal 2-connected induced subgraph of G. A block graph is a connected graph so that all its blocks are complete graphs (cliques). Note that a tree is a block graph where each block is a single edge. For a block graph G, there exists a unique -geodesic between any two vertices u and v. Throughout the article, all graphs considered are block graphs.

Let G be a block graph. For a vertex , the weight of G at v is defined by  = 
. The weight of G is A vertex  is called a weight center of G if  = . The set of weight centers of G is denoted by .

For two vertices u and v in a graph G, denote  the set of vertices that are closer to v than to u. That is, Denote .

Proposition 2.1

Let G be a block graph. The following hold:

For any two adjacent vertices a and w, we have  = .

Proof

(1) By the assumption that  but , we obtain, if  then . So . Moreover, as , . See  in Fig. 1 as an example. (2) is true since . See  in Fig. 1 as an example. □

Lemma 2.2

Let G be a block graph. Then  is contained in a block of G.

Proof

It is enough to consider that . Since G is a block graph, to prove the result, it is enough to show that  is a clique. Assuming to the contrary, there exist  such that x and y are not adjacent. Then x and y are in different blocks. Let 
 be the unique -geodesic in G, 
, for some . Note that 
 are all cut vertices, and 
 for all .

By Proposition 2.1 (1), 
, so 
. Similarly, we have 
. As , by Proposition 2.1 (2), 
 and 
, implying that 
 and 
. Combining the above results, we arrive at the following contradiction
 Hence, the result follows. □

Let G be a block graph. If , by Lemma 2.2,  for some block B of G. We call B the central block of G. A vertex  is a central vertex if  or . Let w be a central vertex of G. If a vertex u is on the -geodesic, then u is an ancestor of v, and v is a descendent of u. If v is a descendent of u and is adjacent to u, then v is a child of u, and u is a parent of v.

Let D be a non-central block that contains a central vertex w, then we say D is adjacent to w. The subgraph induced by the vertices in  along with their descendants is called a branch of G. Two branches are different if they are induced by vertices of two different blocks adjacent to the same central vertex, and are called opposite if they are induced by vertices of two different blocks adjacent to different central vertices. Accordingly, two vertices u and v are said to be in different branches (or opposite branches, respectively) if they belong to different branches (or opposite branches if they belong to opposite branches). Note that opposite branches only occur when G contains more than one central vertex (e.g. Fig. 1).

We view a block graph “rooted” at its central vertices. Define the level function on  by
 We simply denote 
 by  when G is clear in the context. The total level of G is 
  Note that between any two vertices u and v in a block graph G, there is a unique -geodesic, denoted by 
. For a block graph G, define the following: 
 := max{
 : x is a common ancestor of u and v}.
 
  We denote 
, 
 and 
, by ,  and , respectively, when G is clear in the context. The following observations follow directly from the above definitions:

Observation 2.3

Let G be a block graph with diameter . The following hold for all :

(1)
 and ;

(2)
 if and only if u and v are in different or opposite branches, or either of them is a central vertex;

(3)
 if  or u and v are in the same branch.

With Observation 2.3, we are able to describe the distance between two vertices in a block graph.

Proposition 2.4

Let G be a block graph, and . Then

Proof

Assume that u and v are in different or opposite branches, or one of them is a central vertex. Then , if there is only one central vertex on 
. If there are two central vertices on

Assume, otherwise, u and v are in the same branch and none of them is a central vertex. Then 
 contains no central vertices and hence . If 
 contains a common ancestor of u and v, then , as . Otherwise, . Hence the result follows. See 
 on Fig. 1 as an example. □

3. A tight lower bound for the radio number of block graphs
In this section, we present the following results:

•
A lower bound for the radio number of block graphs (Theorem 3.1).

•
Three necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve this bound (Theorem 3.1, Theorem 3.2, Theorem 3.3).

•
Three sufficient conditions to achieve this bound (Theorem 3.4).

Let f be a radio labeling of a graph G. Since f is injective, without loss of generality, we may assume that f induces an ordering 
 of , 
, where

A radio labeling f with  is called an optimal radio labeling. An ordering 
 of  is called optimal if it is induced by an optimal radio labeling.

Now we present a lower bound for the radio number of block graphs.

Theorem 3.1

Let G be a block graph of order p and diameter . Then(2) Moreover, the equality holds if and only if there exists an ordering 
 of  such that all the following hold:

(a)
;

(b)
for , 
 and 
 are in different branches when  = 1, and are in opposite branches when  (i.e. 
 and 
);

(c)
the mapping f on  defined by 
 and 
 for  is a radio labeling for G.

Proof

Suppose f is a radio labeling of G with 
. By definition, 
, for . Summing up these  inequalities, we obtain(3)
 

Case 1: . Then 
 = 0 for . Since G has only one central vertex, 
. Applying Proposition 2.4 and Observation 2.3 to (3), we obtain
 

Case 2: . Since 
, applying Proposition 2.4 and Observation 2.3 to (3), we obtain
 
 
 Hence, the lower bound is true. In addition, it is easy to see in Cases 1 and 2, all the equalities hold if and only if the moreover part is true. □

For a block graph G, we denote the lower bound of  in Theorem 3.1 by . If  then we call G a lower bound block graph. If T is a tree and , then T is also called a lower bound tree (cf. [6], [16]).

In the next two results, we prove additional characterizations (besides the moreover part in Theorem 3.1) of lower bound block graphs.

Theorem 3.2

Let G be a block graph of order p and diameter . Then G is a lower bound block graph if and only if there exists an ordering 
 of  such that Theorem 3.1 (a) holds and the following is true for all :(4)
 

Proof

Necessity: Suppose that . By Theorem 3.1, there exists an optimal radio labeling f with ordering 
 of  such that Theorem 3.1 (a), (b) and (c) hold. By Theorem 3.1 (c),
 
 
 Hence, (4) is true.

Sufficiency: Suppose there exists an ordering 
 of  so that (a) in Theorem 3.1 and (4) are satisfied for all 
 and 
, . We now prove that conditions (b) and (c) in Theorem 3.1 are satisfied. Take  in (4) we get 
, which implies that 
 and 
 are in different branches when , and in opposite branches when . Hence Theorem 3.1 (b) holds.

It remains to prove that f defined in Theorem 3.1 (c) is a radio labeling. Let 
 and 
 () be two arbitrary vertices. By (4),
 
 Hence f is a radio labeling. The proof is complete. □

In [15, Theorem 3] a lower bound of the radio number of trees was given. The above two results generalize [2, Lemma 3.1] and [2, Theorem 3.2]. Precisely, when G is a tree then Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 3.2 are the same as [2, Lemma 3.1] and [2, Theorem 3.2], respectively.

Theorem 3.3

Let G be a block graph of order p and diameter . Then G is a lower bound block graph if and only if there exists an ordering 
 of  such that (a) and (b) in Theorem 3.1 hold, and the following are true:

(a*)
for all i, 
 
;

(b*)
any two vertices 
 and 
  in the same branch satisfy(5)
 
 
 

Proof

Necessity: Suppose . By Theorem 3.2, there exists an ordering 
 of  such that (4) in Theorem 3.2 holds for any two vertices 
 and 
. Applying (4) with 
 and by Proposition 2.4, we obtain
 Note that  when , and 
 is true only when . Thus (a*) is satisfied.

To prove (b*), assume 
 and 
 are in the same branch. Then 
. Combining Proposition 2.4 (for 
) with (4) in Theorem 3.2, as 
, we obtain (5). Hence (b*) is true.

Sufficiency: Suppose there exists an ordering 
 of  such that (a) and (b) in Theorem 3.1 as well as (a*) and (b*) of the statement hold. It is enough to prove that (4) in Theorem 3.2 holds for any 
 and 
, .

If 
 and 
 are in different or opposite branches, then 
. By (a*), the right-hand-side of (4) is at most . Hence (4) holds. Assume 
 and 
 are in the same branch. Then . By direct calculation, (4) can be obtained by Proposition 2.4 and (5). Hence the proof is complete. □

Now we turn to the last part of this section. Namely, we present three sufficient conditions for a block graph to be a lower bound block graph (i.e. the lower bound in Theorem 3.1 is achieved).

Theorem 3.4

Let G be a block graph of order p and diameter . Then G is a lower bound block graph if there exists an ordering 
 of  such that (a) and (b) in Theorem 3.1 hold, and one of the following is true:

(i)
, for all ;

(ii)
, for all ;

(iii)
For all i, 
; and whenever 
 and 
 are in the same branch then .

Proof

Assume (a) and (b) in Theorem 3.1 are true. We prove if one of (i), (ii), (iii) holds, then the ordering 
 of  satisfies (a*) and (b*) of Theorem 3.3. Denote the right-hand-side of (5) by 
. To show Theorem 3.3 (b*) we verify that

 and 
 from the same branch. We prove this by considering two cases.

Case 1.  = 1. Then .

Sub-Case 1.1 Suppose (i) holds. By Theorem 3.1 (b), for each , 
. Thus, Theorem 3.3 (a*) is true. Furthermore, by Theorem 3.1 (a), 
. Hence 
 for all .

Let 
 and 
 () be vertices from the same branch of G. Denote  for some  and . Then
 It remains to show the cases when  and . Assume . Then 
 or 
. Assume 
. (The case for 
 can be proved similarly.) Then 
. Hence
 Finally, assume . If 
, then one can see that 
 and the result follows. Thus, assume 
. By the assumption of (i), this implies 
 and 
. So, 
 and 
. Hence
 Therefore, Theorem 3.3 (b*) holds.

Sub-Case 1.2. Suppose (ii) holds. Then by Theorem 3.1 (a) and (b), 
 for each  and 
 = 0. Thus 
 for . So we have 
 for . Hence Theorem 3.3 (a*) holds.

Let 
 and 
 be two vertices of G from the same branch. If , then 
. Hence 
.

Assume . Then

Sub-Case 1.3. Suppose (iii) holds. Assume  is even. Then for every i, 
. By (iii), 
.

Assume  is odd. Because 
 and 
, we obtain 
. Hence, by (iii), 
.

Case 2: . Then . Note that in this case, (ii) implies (i). Thus, we only need to consider (i) and (iii).

Sub-Case 2.1. Suppose (i) holds. By Theorem 3.1 (a), 
. By (i) and Theorem 3.1 (b), for each , 
. Thus, Theorem 3.3 (a*) is true. Moreover, note that 
.

Let 
 and 
 be vertices from the same branch of G. Denote  for some  and . Then

It remains to show the cases when  and . Assume . Then 
 or 
. Assume 
 (The case 
 can be proved similarly). Then 
. Hence,

Finally, assume . If 
, then one can see that 
 and the result follows: Thus, assume 
. By the assumption of (i), this implies that 
 and 
. So, 
 and 
. Hence,

Therefor, Theorem 3.3 (b*) holds.

Sub-Case 2.2. Suppose (iii) holds. Assume  is even. Then 
 and 
. These imply that 
. Hence by (iii), 
.

Assume  is odd. Then 
 for any . Again, by (iii), 
. The proof is complete. □

4. Lower bound block graphs
Using the results in Section 3 we present two families of lower bound block graphs. Namely, the level-wise regular block graphs and the extended star of blocks.

4.1. Level-wise regular block graphs
We call a non-cut-vertex in a block graph an end vertex. Let  be positive integers, , and let 
, , be pairs of positive integers with 
. If , we additionally assume 
. The level-wise regular block graphs, denoted by 
, is defined by the following:

•
Initially (): For , take a clique 
 with vertex set 
; for , identify one vertex of each of 
 copies of

 copies of clique 
 to each end vertex of the cliques joined in the -th step.

Proof

The order and the total level of G are
 
 
 
 

Substituting the above into (2) we obtain the right-hand-side of (6) as a lower bound for . We now prove that this lower bound is tight by giving an ordering 
 of  which satisfies Theorem 3.2.

Denote 
. In the following we denote each vertex v with , , with an x-bit sub-index.

Initially: Assign a 1-bit sub-index to all level-1 vertices. For each , denote the 
 children of

 such that any 
 consecutive vertices (i.e., vertices with consecutive sub-indices) are in different blocks while 
 and 
 are in the same block for 
.

Inductively: Suppose all vertices up to level-l are assigned with a sub-index. Denote the 
 children of 
, , 
, , by 
, where 
 such that any 
 consecutive vertices are in different blocks while 
 and 
 are in the same block for 
. Continue this process until all vertices are indexed.

Next, we define an ordering 
 as follows: Let 
, and for , let 
, where
 
 
 
 For , let 
.

Note that when , we have

; and when , we have 
. Hence Theorem 3.1 (a) holds. Moreover, for all i, 
 and 
 are in different branches when , and are in opposite branches when . Hence Theorem 3.1 (b) holds. To complete the proof it remains to show that the ordering 
 defined above satisfies (4) in Theorem 3.2.

For , denote 
 the set of level-x vertices. Then

 (if ) for some 
. Hence 
. If  then 
. If , then 
. This completes the proof. □

The readers are referred to Fig. 2 about the ordering used in the proof of Theorem 4.1.

4.2. Extended star of blocks
Let  be positive integers, and 
 be the path with h edges. The path of cliques, denoted by 
, is obtained by the following process:

•
For each edge  on 
, add  vertices, 
, and edges so that 
 form a clique. A vertex v in 
 is called a tail vertex if its eccentricity (the maximum distance from a vertex to v) is equal to the diameter of 
.

The extended star of blocks is defined by the following: Start with a clique 
 with vertex set 
. Let k be a positive integer. In the case , we additionally assume . The extended star of blocks, denoted by 
, is established by identifying one tail vertex of each of the k copies of 
 to each

Theorem 4.2

Let

Proof

It is straightforward to verify that the order and the total level of graph G are
 
 Substituting the above into (2) we obtain the right-hand-side of (7) as a lower bound for . Now we prove that this lower bound is tight by giving an optimal ordering 
 of  which will induce a labeling with the desired span.

Denote 
. For each

 for . For , denote 
, the j-th vertex of level-i in 
 where 
 are the cut-vertices of G, .

We now rename 
, as {

Case A: km is odd. If h is odd, let 
, where
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

If h is even, let

Next define an ordering 
 as follows. If , let

It is easy to see that 
 defined above satisfies Theorem 3.1 (a) and (b). To complete the proof it suffices to show 
 satisfies (4) in Theorem 3.2. If  = 2 or 3 then it is easy to verify (4). Hence, assume . Let 
 and 
 be two vertices with . Note that by our definition of

  If , then

5. Radio numbers of the line graphs of trees
Let G be a graph. The line graph of G, denoted by , is the graph whose vertices are the edges of G, where  when . Observe that every tree and its line graph are both block graphs. It is known and easy to see that a graph G is the line graph of a tree if and only if G is a connected block graph in which each cut-vertex is on exactly two blocks (cf. [11]).

It is known that a connected graph G is isomorphic to its line graph if and only if G is a cycle. Hence there is a one-one correspondence between trees and their line graphs. Note that the line graph of an n-vertex path 
 is 
. It is known [15] that 
 is a lower bound tree if and only if m is even. Hence, there exist lower bound trees whose line graphs are not lower bound block graphs, and there exist non-lower bound trees whose line graphs are lower bound block graphs.

In this section we investigate the relations between the radio numbers of a tree and its line graph. In particular, we establish conditions for lower bound trees so that their line graphs are lower bound block graphs. Moreover, we set up conditions so that the trees are lower bound trees given their line graphs are lower bound block graphs.

We use the following presentation for the line graph of a tree. Let T be a tree rooted at a weight center 
⁎
. If there exists an edge e = uv with 
⁎
 = 
⁎
, then u is called the edge ancestor of v, and v is an edge descendent of u. We denote a vertex in  by the edge descendent of the corresponding edge in T. That is, if  and v is an edge descendent vertex of u then we denote the edge uv by the vertex v in .

The following result is useful in our proofs.

Theorem 5.1

[15] Every tree T has one or two weight centers. If w is a weight center of T, then each component of  contains at most  vertices. Moreover, T has two weight centers, 
, if and only if 
 is an edge of T and 
 consists of two equal-sized components.

Combining Theorem 5.1 and definition of line graphs, we obtain

Corollary 5.2

For a tree T with , we have .

Consider the case that . Denote 
⁎
 and . In T (rooted at 
⁎
), w is an edge descendant of 
⁎
. Define  the subgraph of  induced by the following vertex set:

Lemma 5.3

Let T be a tree with . Denote . Then

(i)
 consists of two branches,  and .

(ii)
 
.

Proof

Denote 
⁎
. Then w is an edge descendant of 
⁎
 in T and there are two branches in , namely,  and . Hence (i) is true. Because , by Theorem 5.1, each branch in  contains at most 
 
 vertices. Thus (ii) follows. □

Observation 5.4

Let T be a tree of order  and let  be its line graph. The following can be obtained without difficulty:

(i)
, .

(ii)
 

(iii)
 

(iv)
 

The next two results deal with the situation that T is a lower bound tree. Precisely, we show necessary conditions that its block graph is also a lower bound block graph.

Theorem 5.5

Let T be a tree with diameter  and . If  is even, or  is odd with , then  is not a lower bound block graph.

Proof

Denote . By the assumption and Lemma 5.3, we have , and  consists of two branches,  and . Since , it must be . Therefore it is impossible to find an ordering of  such that Theorem 3.1 (b) holds. Hence,  is not a lower bound block graph. □

Theorem 5.6

The above results can be applied to the line graphs of many known families of lower bound trees. A level-wise regular tree is a tree rooted at one vertex w or two (adjacent) vertices w and 
, in which all vertices with the minimum distance i from w or 
 have the same degree 
, for , where h is the height of T. Denote these trees by 
 (with one root) and 
 (with two roots), respectively. It was proved by Halász and Tuza [9, Theorem 4-5] that 
 and 
 are both lower bound trees when 
 for all i.
A complete m-ary tree of height h denoted by

 and

 for .

The -banana tree, denoted by , is a single-rooted level-wise regular tree of height 3. Precisely:
 The -firecrackers tree, denoted by , is the tree obtained by taking n copies of a -star and identifying a leaf of each of them to a vertex of 
 (n-vertex of path). In [2, Theorem 4.1-4.2], Bantva et al. proved that banana trees  with  and  and firecracker trees  with  are all lower bound trees. Chavez et al. [6] proved a more general result and showed that  is a lower bound tree for  and .

See Fig. 4 for examples of the above families of lower bound trees. Note that for every banana tree and complete level-wise regular tree with 
, there exists an optimal radio labeling f whose induced ordering 
 satisfies 
 where  (given in [2], [9], [14]). For the firecracker trees, it is easy to obtain an optimal radio labeling f whose induced ordering 
 satisfies 
 from the optimal radio labeling given in [2]. By Theorem 5.6, the line graphs of all these lower bound trees are lower bound block graphs. Hence, one can determine their radio numbers by direct calculation.

In the following three results, we prove conditions such that T is a lower bound tree, given its line graph is a lower bound block graph.

Theorem 5.10

Let T be a tree with diameter  and 
. If its line graph  is a lower bound block graph, then T is a lower bound tree and .

Proof

By Theorem 5.1,

). Then 
⁎

 and 
, each has  vertices.

Because  is a lower bound block graph, by Theorem 3.1, there exists an ordering of

Theorem 5.11

Let T be a tree with  for some odd p and diameter . If  and  is a lower bound block graph, then T is a lower bound tree and .

Proof

Denote

, respectively.

As  is a lower bound block graph, by Theorem 5.5, . By Theorem 3.1, there exists an ordering 
 of  such that Theorem 3.1 holds, where f is the labeling in Theorem 3.1 (c). By symmetry, assume 
. Note that in 
, the vertices with odd (or even, respectively) subscripts are in 
 (B, respectively).

Define an ordering 
 of  by: 
⁎

 on  by 
 and 
 for all . One can easily verify that 
 is a radio labeling of T satisfying (c) in Theorem 3.1 with the desired span. The proof is complete. □

Theorem 5.12

Let T be a tree of order p and diameter . Assume ,  is a lower bound block graph, and there exists an ordering 
 of  satisfying Theorem 3.1 such that the following holds for all : If 
 or

Proof

Since , so . Denote 
⁎
 and  = {
, 
, …,

Define an ordering 
 of  by

 for . Then (a) and (b) in Theorem 3.1 hold for T.

Define a labeling 
 on  by

 is a descendent of the other. By Observation 5.4 (ii), 
. Therefore, 
. Hence 
 is a radio labeling of T with the desired span. □

While we have shown several families of trees such that both the trees and their corresponding line graphs are lower bound block graphs, there are trees for which T is not a lower bound block graph but its line graph is a lower bound block graph. That is,  but . For instance, 
 and we know 
 is not a lower bound tree while 
 is. In addition, we give another example as follows. A tree is called a caterpillar if the removal of all its degree-one vertices results in a path, called the spine. Denote by  the caterpillar in which the spine has length  and all vertices on the spine have degree k, where  and . It was shown by Vaidya and Bantva [25] that  is a lower bound block graph. On the other hand, it was proved by Bantva et al. [2] that  when , but  when .

On the other hand, so far, all the known lower bound trees excepts paths have their line graphs being lower bound block graphs. The following question is raised:

Question 1

Are there infinitely many lower bound trees T other than paths for which  is not a lower bound block graph?
