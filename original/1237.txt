Abstract
A subset  of edges of a graph  is called a matching if no two edges of M share a common vertex. An edge  is said to dominate itself and all other edges adjacent to it. A matching M in a graph  is called a dominating induced matching (d.i.m.) if every edge of G is dominated by edges of M exactly once. The dominating induced matching decide (DIM-Decide) problem asks whether a graph G contains a dominating induced matching. The dominating induced matching (DIM) problem asks to compute a dominating induced matching (d.i.m.) in a graph G that admits a dominating induced matching. The DIM-Decide problem is known to be NP-complete for general graphs as well as for bipartite graphs. In this paper, we strengthen the NP-completeness result of the DIM-Decide problem by showing that this problem remains NP-complete for perfect elimination bipartite graphs, a proper subclass of bipartite graphs. On the positive side, we characterize the class of star-convex bipartite graphs admitting a d.i.m. This characterization leads to a linear time algorithm to test whether a star-convex bipartite graph admits a d.i.m. and, if so, constructs a d.i.m. in such a star-convex bipartite graph in linear time. We also propose polynomial time algorithms to construct a d.i.m. in long-k-star-convex bipartite graphs as well as in circular-convex bipartite graphs if the input graph admits a d.i.m.

1. Introduction
A subset  of edges of a graph  is called a matching if no two edges of M share a common vertex. Vertices that are incident on the edges of a matching M are called M-saturated vertices. An edge e is said to dominate itself and all the edges that share a common vertex with it. A matching M in G is called an induced matching if every edge of the graph G is dominated by at most one edge of M. In this paper, we study an important variant of matching called dominating induced matching. A matching M in G is called a dominating induced matching if every edge of the graph G is dominated by the edges of M exactly once. The DIM-Decide problem is a decision problem that asks whether a graph G admits a dominating induced matching. Fig. 1 contains a graph 
 that admits a d.i.m. and contains another graph 
 that does not admit a d.i.m.

The DIM-Decide problem is known to be NP-complete for general graphs [11] as well as for bipartite graphs [20]. However, the DIM problem is known to be polynomial time solvable for several graph classes such as 
-free graphs for  [5], hole-free graphs [3], chordal graphs [19], generalized series-parallel graphs [19], dually chordal graphs [4], and claw-free graphs [7]. Let 
 denote the graph with vertices 
 such that the subgraph induced by 
 forms a 
, the subgraph induced by 
 forms a 
 and the subgraph induced by 
 forms a 
. The DIM problem is known to be polynomial time solvable 
-free graphs [14], 
-free graphs [12], and 
-free graphs [6]. Further, it has been conjectured [12] that for every fixed , the DIM problem is solvable in polynomial time for 
-free graphs. Some spectral results related to the DIM problem can be found in [1]. Recently, bounds on the number of total dominating induced matchings in a graph have also been studied in [16]. The DIM problem has been widely studied due to its applications in various problems such as resource allocation problems in parallel processing systems [18], encoding theory, and network routing problems [11].

The class of perfect elimination bipartite graphs was introduced by Golumbic and Goss [10]. This subclass of bipartite graphs is sandwiched between bipartite graphs and chordal bipartite graphs. Since the DIM-Decide problem is NP-complete for bipartite graphs [20] and the DIM problem is polynomial time solvable for chordal bipartite graphs [3], it is interesting to determine the complexity status of DIM-Decide and DIM problem for perfect elimination bipartite graphs. Another graph class that we have considered is the class of circular-convex bipartite graphs, which is a generalization of convex bipartite graphs. This class was introduced by Liang and Blum in [15] and has been studied recently by researchers. Note that the DIM problem is polynomial time solvable in convex bipartite graphs. So, it is interesting to determine the complexity status of the DIM-Decide and the DIM problem in circular-convex bipartite graphs. The class of tree-convex bipartite graphs includes the class of convex bipartite graphs. These graphs are recognizable in linear time, and the associated tree T can also be constructed in linear-time [2]. The status of the DIM problem is still open on tree-convex bipartite graphs. The star-convex bipartite graphs and triad-convex bipartite graphs are the subclasses of tree-convex bipartite graphs and have been recently studied in [8], [17], [23]. The long-k-star-convex bipartite graphs for some fixed integer k is a generalization of triad-convex bipartite graphs. Since the class of long-k-star-convex bipartite graphs is also sandwiched between convex bipartite graphs and tree-convex bipartite graphs, it is interesting to determine the complexity status of the DIM-Decide and the DIM problem for long-k-star-convex bipartite graphs. The containment relationship between the different subclasses of bipartite graphs is shown in Fig. 2.

A preliminary version of this paper appeared in [21].
2. Preliminaries
We consider only simple and connected graphs. In a graph , the open and closed neighborhood of a vertex  are denoted by  and , respectively, where  and . For a graph , the subgraph of G induced by  is denoted by , where 
 and 
. The degree of a vertex v is 
 and is denoted by 
. If 
, then v is called a pendant vertex. Let , then a vertex  is said to be a private neighbor of  if  and  for all . Given a matching M in a graph G, if the edge , then y is called the M-mate of x and vice versa. Given a positive integer k, we denote . The distance between two vertices u and v in a graph G denoted as  is defined as the number of edges in the shortest path between them.

A graph G is called a bipartite graph if its vertex set V can be partitioned into two independent sets, X and Y, in order that every edge of G joins a vertex in X to a vertex in Y. An edge  of  is said to be a bisimplicial edge if  induces a complete bipartite subgraph of G. Let 
 be a sequence of pairwise nonadjacent edges, that is, edges that do not share a common vertex. Denote 
 and let 
. Then σ is said to be a perfect edge elimination ordering for G if each edge 
 is bisimplicial in 
 for  and 
 has no edge. A graph for which there exists a perfect edge elimination ordering is called a perfect elimination bipartite graph.

A bipartite graph , where 
 and 
 is called a convex bipartite graph if there exists a linear ordering of vertices of X, say 
 such that for every vertex 
, the vertices in 
 are consecutive in β. A bipartite graph  where 
 and 
 is called a circular-convex bipartite graph if there exists a circular ordering of vertices in X, say 
 such that for every vertex 
, the vertices in 
 forms a circular arc in the circular ordering γ. It can be seen easily that every convex bipartite graph is a circular-convex bipartite graph, but the converse need not be true.

A cycle is a non-empty sequence of distinct vertices 
, , such that 
 for  and 
. A cycle on n vertices is denoted by 
. A tree with exactly one non-pendant vertex is a star. A triad is a tree consisting of three paths with a common end vertex. Similarly, a long-k-star, where k is a fixed integer, can be defined as a tree consisting of k paths with a common end vertex. For example, a triad is a long-3-star.

A bipartite graph  is said to be a tree-convex bipartite graph, if a tree 
 can be defined on X in order that for every vertex , the vertices in 
 induces a subtree of T. The tree-convex bipartite graphs are recognizable in linear time, and the associated tree T can also be constructed in linear time [2]. If the tree T in a tree-convex bipartite graph is a star, then G is called a star-convex bipartite graph, and if the tree T is a triad, then G is called a triad-convex bipartite graph. Similarly, if the tree T in a tree-convex bipartite graph is a long-k-star for some fixed integer k, then G is called a long-k-star-convex bipartite graph.

The alternative definition of the DIM problem [13] asks to determine if the vertex set of a graph G can be colored with colors W and B such that no two vertices with colors W are adjacent and every B colored vertex has exactly one B colored neighbor. A W-B coloring of V is said to be a valid partial W-B coloring if only a part of the vertices of V are assigned with W and B colors such that no two W colored vertices are adjacent and no B colored vertex has more than one B colored neighbor. If all the vertices in a graph can be assigned B and W colors such that no two W colored vertices are adjacent and every B colored vertex has exactly one B colored neighbor, then it is called a valid total W-B coloring.

Observation 2.1

[13] A graph  admits a d.i.m. if and only if there exists a valid total W-B coloring of V.

Proof

Let G admits a d.i.m. M. Then, define a coloring  such that the M-saturated vertices of G are assigned color B and the unsaturated vertices of G are assigned color W. Note that for every M-saturated vertex v, there exists exactly one M-saturated vertex in the neighborhood of v. Otherwise, there will exist some edge e that will get dominated by M twice, which is not possible. Moreover, there cannot exist any edge between any two unsaturated vertices of G. Otherwise, there will exist some edge e that is not dominated by M, which again is not possible. Hence, it is easy to observe that f is a valid total W-B coloring of V.

Conversely, let  admits a valid total W-B coloring . Let 
 and 
. It is clear that 
 is a 1-regular graph. Define a matching 
 is an edge in 
. Since G is connected, every 
 has at least one neighbor in 
. Hence, M is a d.i.m. □

Lemma 2.1

Let  be a graph that admits a valid total W-B coloring . If x is a pendant vertex in G and , then .

Proof

By Observation 2.1, G admits a d.i.m., say M. Since xy is a pendant edge of G, either  or  for some . So, . □

The following lemmas will be used repeatedly in the proof of our main results.

Lemma 2.2

[5] Let M be a dominating induced matching in a graph . If 
 is a cycle on four vertices in graph G, then none of the edges of 
 can belong to M.

Lemma 2.3

[5] If a graph G admits a valid total W-B coloring, then the opposite vertices of a 
 are colored with the same color with respect to the W-B coloring.

3. Perfect elimination bipartite graphs
In this section, we strengthen the NP-completeness result of the DIM-Decide problem for bipartite graphs by showing that this problem remains NP-complete for perfect elimination bipartite graphs, a proper subclass of bipartite graphs. To prove the NP-completeness, we give a polynomial time reduction from the Exact Cover Problem, which is defined as follows:

Exact Cover Problem:

Instance: A set 
 and a collection of sets 
 that are subsets of X.

Question: Does there exist a subcollection 
 of S whose union is equal to X and 
 for any 
 and 
 in 
.

Theorem 3.1

The DIM-Decide problem is NP-complete for perfect elimination bipartite graphs.

Proof

Given a perfect elimination bipartite graph  and a subset , it can be checked in polynomial time whether M is a dominating induced matching of G or not. So, the DIM-Decide problem belongs to the class NP for perfect elimination bipartite graphs. To show the NP-completeness, we give a polynomial time reduction from the Exact Cover Problem, which is already known to be NP-complete [9]. The reduction is described below:

Given an instance  of an Exact Cover Problem, where 
 and 
, we construct a perfect elimination bipartite graph 
 as follows:

Let 
,

, and

.

The constructed graph 
 is a perfect elimination bipartite graph as 
 is a perfect edge elimination ordering of 
. This is true because pendant edges are always bisimplicial.

Fig. 3 illustrates the construction of

Claim

The instance  has an exact cover 
 if and only if 
 has a dominating induced matching.

Proof

Necessity: Let 
 be an exact cover of the instance I of the Exact Cover Problem. Define 
. It is easy to see that M is a dominating induced matching of G.

Sufficiency: Let M be a dominating induced matching of graph G. Note that M can not contain edges of the form 
 as it would imply that 
 and 
 are not in M. So, to dominate 
, one should take 
 in M, but by doing so, one can not dominate 
. Consequently, M contains exactly one edge adjacent to 
 for  and exactly one edge adjacent to 
 for . Moreover, if M contains 
, then M contains edges 
 for all 
 in 
. Let 
 be defined by 
 if 
. Clearly, 
 is a family of pairwise disjoint sets whose union is equal to X. Thus, 
 is an exact cover of I. ◇

Hence, the DIM-Decide problem is NP-complete for perfect elimination bipartite graphs. □

 
4. Star-convex bipartite graphs
A bipartite graph  is called a star-convex bipartite graph if a star 
 can be defined on X in order that for every vertex , the vertices in 
 induces a subtree of T. Fig. 4 shows an example of a star-convex bipartite graph and its corresponding star T. The following lemma characterizes the star-convex bipartite graphs.

Lemma 4.1

[22] A bipartite graph  is a star-convex bipartite graph if and only if there exists a vertex 
 in X such that every vertex y in Y is either a pendant vertex or is adjacent to 
.

Fig. 4. A star-convex bipartite graph with the associated star.

In this section, we characterize star-convex bipartite graphs admitting a d.i.m. This characterization leads to a linear time algorithm to compute a d.i.m. in a star-convex bipartite graph admitting a . A star-convex bipartite graph can be recognized in linear time and given a star-convex bipartite graph; its corresponding star can be obtained in linear time [2]. According to Observation 2.1, let us recall that a graph  has a . say M if and only if G admits a valid total W-B coloring . In this case, denoted as 
 and as 
, one has that: (i) 
 is a partition of V, (ii) 
 induces a 1-regular graph, and (iii) 
 is an independent set.

Theorem 4.1

The dominating induced matching problem is linear time solvable in star-convex bipartite graphs.

Proof

Let  be a star-convex bipartite graph and let 
 be according to Lemma 4.1. Consider the distance levels of all the vertices of G with respect to 
, that is, let 
 dist
 for . Note that, 
 is an independent set for any . Also, 
, 
, 
 and by Lemma 4.1, 
 for every .

Then let us write:

-
 has no neighbor in 
 and has exactly one neighbor in 
;

-
 has no neighbor in 
 and has more than one neighbor in 
;

-
 has a neighbor in 
;

-
⁎
 has a neighbor in 
;

By Lemma 4.1, each vertex of 
 is a pendant vertex. By Lemma 2.1, for every valid total W-B coloring of G, each vertex of 
 is in 
.
To check if G has a d.i.m., we will consider two cases: In the first case, we will assume that 
 and check if G has a d.i.m. with 
. In the second case, we will assume that 
 and check if G has a d.i.m. with 
. In both cases, we will get forcing conditions that will lead either to the solution or to a proof that G does not admit a d.i.m.

Case 1: 

First, note that every vertex of 
 should belong to 
 because 
 should be an independent set. Next, recall that each vertex of 
 is in 
. Also, each vertex of 
 should have its M-mate in 
⁎
 and not in 
; else, 
 would not be 1-regular. It further implies that each vertex of 
 should be in 
. Next, if each 
 has exactly one neighbor, say 
⁎
, then ; else G has no d.i.m. with 
. This is because otherwise, 
 would not be 1-regular. So, assume that each 
 has exactly one neighbor in 
⁎
. It also implies that each vertex of 
⁎
 has its M-mate in 
.

Now, let us focus on the sets 
 and 
. By Lemma 2.3, each vertex of 
 should be in 
. Next, let us write
 Then, the set 
 can be partitioned into 
, where 
 for each , with 
 possibly empty. If 
⁎
, then each vertex of 
 is in 
 because each 
⁎
 already has its M-mate in 
. If 
⁎
, then 
 because otherwise, 
 would have no M-mate in G. Also, note that exactly one vertex of 
 (one can choose any vertex) will belong in 
, and the other vertices of 
 will belong in 
.

Case 2: 

If 
, then exactly one vertex of 
 can belong in 
 while the other vertices of 
 have to belong in 
. Recall that each vertex of 
 is in 
. Let us write
 Then, the set 
 can be partitioned into 
, where 
 for each , with each 
 non-empty. Now, since 
 should be 1-regular and any vertex of 
 cannot have any M-mate in 
, so for each , exactly one 
 should belong in 
 and the rest should belong in 
. In particular, it implies that each vertex of 
⁎
 is in 
.

Next, let us focus on the sets 
 and 
. By Lemma 2.3, each vertex of 
 is in 
. If 
, then G has no d.i.m. with 
. This is because otherwise 
 would not be 1-regular. So, assume that 
.

Next, let us write
 Then, the set 
 can be partitioned into 
, where 
 for each , with 
 possibly empty. Note that, by the arguments given above and by Lemma 2.1, one has 
 for at most one index , else G has no d.i.m. with 
. Let , without loss of generality. Now, consider the following subcases:

Case 2.1: 
.

It follows that 
 should be in 
 by Lemma 2.1. However, if 
⁎
, then we will reach a contradiction, and thus G will not admit a d.i.m. with 
. On the other hand, if 
⁎
, then one can conclude that 
 is in 
, i.e., 
 is the M-mate of 
. Further, it will imply that the vertices of 
 are in 
, and vertices of 
 are in 
.

Case 2.2: 
.

Consider the set 
⁎
. If 
⁎
, then G has no d.i.m. with 
. This is because in this case, we will not be able to find the M-mate of 
. Also, by the arguments given above, every vertex in 
⁎
 is in 
. If 
⁎
, then exactly one vertex (one can choose any vertex) of 
⁎
 is in 
 and the other vertices of 
⁎
 are in 
.

In this way, we will either obtain a valid total W-B coloring of G or prove that G does not admit a d.i.m.

Hence, the theorem is proved. □

We now present a linear time algorithm DIM-Star-Convex(G), which either finds a d.i.m. in a given star-convex bipartite graph if one exists or reports that none exists. The pseudocode of the algorithm is given below:

Algorithm 1. DIM-Star-Convex(G).

Talking about the time complexity of DIM-Star-Convex(G), we first recall that given a star-convex bipartite graph, its corresponding star can be obtained in linear time [2]. Given the adjacency list of a star-convex bipartite graph G and a corresponding star of G, the algorithm DIM-Star-Convex(G) is just scanning the adjacency list of the vertices a constant number of times, which takes linear time. Hence, we have the following theorem.

Theorem 4.2

Algorithm DIM-Star-Convex(G) correctly computes a d.i.m. in a star-convex bipartite graph G in linear time, if and only if G admits a d.i.m. Otherwise, it reports that G does not admit a d.i.m.

Given a weighted graph , where the weight of each edge is a positive real number, the minimum weight dominating induced matching (MWDIM) problem asks to compute a d.i.m. M in a graph G that admits a d.i.m. such that the sum of the weights on the edges of M is minimum. It can be noted that algorithm DIM-Star-Convex(G) can be modified easily to obtain an algorithm for the MWDIM problem. The only thing that one needs to keep in mind is that while choosing the M-mate of a vertex, if there are multiple options available, always select a vertex where the weight on the corresponding edge is minimum among all the possible edges.

5. Algorithms for long-k-star-convex and circular-convex bipartite graphs
In this section, we propose polynomial time algorithms to compute a d.i.m. in long-k-star-convex bipartite graphs and circular-convex bipartite graphs if one exists. Long-k-star-convex bipartite graphs and circular-convex bipartite graphs are superclasses of convex bipartite graphs. It can be decided in polynomial time whether a convex bipartite graph admits a d.i.m., and if the answer is yes, then a d.i.m. can be constructed in polynomial time [13].

Recall that a valid partial W-B coloring is a coloring of a subset S of vertices of a graph  with B and W colors such that no two W vertices are adjacent and a B vertex has at most one adjacent B vertex, and a valid total W-B coloring is a coloring of the whole vertex set V with colors B and W such that every B vertex has exactly one adjacent B vertex and no two W vertices are adjacent.

Fig. 5 shows an example of a graph G with two valid partial W-B colorings 
 and 
. The valid partial W-B coloring 
 can be extended to a valid total W-B coloring by coloring vertices c and d with color B and vertex e with color W. On the other hand, the valid partial W-B coloring 
 cannot be extended to a valid total W-B coloring.

Fig. 5. Graphs showing valid partial W-B coloring.

Korpelainen [13] proposed a polynomial time algorithm for the problem of deciding whether a valid partial W-B coloring can be extended to a valid total W-B coloring in a convex bipartite graph. The following fact, which is easy to see, was observed by Korpelainen [13].

Observation 5.1

[13] Let  be a subset of vertices of . Let 
 be a valid partial W-B coloring such that all the vertices in  are colored and none of the vertices in  are colored. Let 
 be the restriction of 
 to . Then 
 can be extended to a valid total W-B coloring of G if and only if 
 can be extended to a valid total W-B coloring of 
.

The key ideas of our algorithm for the DIM problem for long-k-star-convex bipartite graphs and circular-convex bipartite graphs are described below.

First, we select a subset  of  so that  is a convex bipartite graph. We check if there exists a valid partial W-B coloring 
 of  such that 
 which is a restriction of 
 to  can be extended to a valid total W-B coloring of .

We show that there is such an S and the number of valid partial W-B colorings of  is 
 for some constant k, where n is the number of vertices in G. Since  is a convex bipartite graph, it can be tested in polynomial time whether 
 can be extended to a valid total W-B coloring [13]. So, this approach leads to a polynomial time algorithm for the DIM problem in long-k-star-convex bipartite graphs and circular-convex bipartite graphs.

5.1. Long-k-star-convex bipartite graphs
In this subsection, we propose a polynomial time algorithm for the DIM problem in long-k-star-convex bipartite graphs.

Let  be a long-k-star-convex bipartite graph with a long-k-star 
 defined on X in order that for every vertex , 
 is a subtree of T. Let 
 be the path in 
,  such that 
. Let 
 be such that 
, 1. It can be noted that 
 is the common vertex in all the k paths 
 i.e. 
 for all . A long-k-star T for  is shown in Fig. 6.

The following lemma allows us to solve the DIM problem in long-k-star-convex bipartite graphs using the solution of the DIM problem in convex bipartite graphs.

Lemma 5.1

Let  be a long-k-star-convex bipartite graph with a long-k-star 
 centered at 
 and 
. Then 
 is a convex bipartite graph.

Proof

Let  be a long-k-star-convex bipartite graph with a long-k-star 
 centered at 
. Let 
 be the path in 
,  such that 
. Consider the ordering 
 defined on 
. Let 
. Since 
 is a connected subgraph of T and 
, 
 appears consecutively in 
 for some . So, 
 appears consecutively in α. Hence, 
 is a convex bipartite graph. □

The following lemma will help in reducing the number of choices to be considered for solving the DIM problem in long-k-star-convex bipartite graphs.

Lemma 5.2

Let M be a d.i.m. in a long-k-star-convex bipartite graph G. If M does not saturate 
, then M saturates all the vertices in 
, and 
 can have at most k neighbors.

Proof

Since M is a d.i.m. and M does not saturate 
, and M should dominate 
 for each 
, M saturates each 
. By contradiction, suppose that 
. Consider any  neighbors of 
, say 
. Let 
. Then at least two vertices from the set 
 will lie in the same path 
 for some . Without loss of generality, let 
. Also, assume that the distance between 
 and 
 is less than the distance between 
 and 
 in the path 
. Since 
 is adjacent to 
 as well as 
 and also by the definition of a long-k-star-convex bipartite graph, 
 is a subtree of T, 
 must be adjacent to 
. But, by the definition of a d.i.m., if 
 and 
 are edges in a d.i.m., then 
. So, this contradicts that M is a d.i.m. and hence 
 has at most k neighbors. □

Corollary 5.1

Let G be a long-k-star-convex bipartite graph with a long-k-star T centered at the vertex 
. If 
 and a d.i.m. exists in G, then it should saturate the vertex 
.

Before presenting the main algorithm, we present the main idea of the algorithm. Consider a long-k-star-convex bipartite graph  with a long-k-star T centered at the vertex 
. Let 
. By Observation 5.1, if we can color the vertices present in the set  with respect to the W-B coloring, then we can easily remove S from G.

The vertex 
 can be colored either with color W or with color B.

First, we color 
 with color B. Then, exactly one 
 is selected and is assigned color B. Color the remaining vertices in 
 with color W. All the vertices in 
 are forced to be given color B. If any of the neighbors of y other than 
 have been assigned color B, then this will not lead to a valid partial W-B coloring, and we will repeat the process with a different 
. Otherwise, we color the vertices in the set 
 with color W. Now all the vertices in  are colored, which results in a valid partial W-B coloring, say 
. Note that there are 
 possibilities of choosing the vertex y resulting in 
 valid partial W-B colorings in this case.

Next, we consider the case where 
 is assigned color W. All the vertices in 
 are forced to be colored with color B. Next, we color the vertices in 
. A vertex w is called a private neighbor of a vertex 
 if w is adjacent to only one vertex y of 
. Now, for each 
, we choose a private neighbor w of y and color it with color B and the remaining neighbors of y with color W. So we get a valid partial W-B coloring 
 of . Note that in this case, we need to consider at most  cases for each 
, where Δ is the maximum degree of G as the number of private neighbors of each y is bounded by Δ.

In this way, after getting a valid partial W-B coloring 
 of , we obtain a convex bipartite graph 
 for which we can find a valid total W-B coloring (if one exists) in polynomial time. We will then combine the valid total W-B coloring of graph 
 obtained by applying the algorithm in [13] with the W-B coloring of the set S, say 
 to get a valid total W-B coloring (hence a d.i.m.) of the long-k-star-convex bipartite graph G [13].

Furthermore, we define a function 
. The main task of this function is to either extend the valid partial W-B coloring 
 of a given convex bipartite graph 
 to a valid total W-B coloring of 
 and to store its solution in 
 or to return 0 if the given valid partial W-B coloring of 
 can not be extended to a valid total W-B coloring.

We now present a polynomial time algorithm DIM-Long-k-Star-Convex(G), which either finds a d.i.m. in a given long-k-star-convex bipartite graph if one exists or reports that none exists. The pseudocode of the algorithm is given below:

Theorem 5.1

Algorithm DIM-Long-k-Star-Convex(G) correctly computes a d.i.m. in a long-k-star-convex bipartite graph G in polynomial time, if and only if G admits a d.i.m. Otherwise, it reports that G does not admit a d.i.m.

5.2. Circular-convex bipartite graphs
In this subsection, we propose a polynomial time algorithm for the DIM problem in circular-convex bipartite graphs. These graphs are a generalization of the well-known convex bipartite graphs.

Let  be a circular-convex bipartite graph. Without loss of generality, consider a circular ordering 
 defined on X in order that for every , the vertices in 
 forms a circular arc in the circular ordering σ.

The following lemma allows us to solve the DIM problem in circular-convex bipartite graphs using the solution of the DIM problem in convex bipartite graphs.

Lemma 5.3

Let  be a circular-convex bipartite graph with a circular ordering 
 defined on X. Let 
 and 
. Then 
 is a convex bipartite graph.

Proof

Let  be a circular-convex bipartite graph with a circular ordering 
 defined on X. Consider the ordering 
 defined on X. Let 
. Now, 
 is a circular arc. However, this circular arc will contain at most one of 
 and 
. So 
 is an interval on γ. Hence, 
 is a convex bipartite graph. □

The following lemma will help in reducing the number of choices to be considered for solving the DIM problem in circular-convex bipartite graphs.

Lemma 5.4

Let  be a circular-convex bipartite graph with a circular ordering 
 defined on X. If there exist a valid total W-B coloring of graph G, then all the vertices in set 
 should be colored with the same color w.r.to the W-B coloring. Moreover, if , then all  should be colored with color W.

Proof

If , then the proof is trivial. Next assume that . Let 
 and 
 be any two vertices in S. Now, the vertices 
 forms a 
 where 
 and 
 are opposite each other in the 
. By Lemma 2.3, 
 and 
 should get the same color with respect to the W-B coloring. Since this is true for any two vertices in the set S, all vertices in S should be colored with the same color.

For the second part of the proof, assume that  and 
. Since G is circular-convex bipartite and by construction, without loss of generality, assume that 
. If all the vertices in the set S are colored with color B with respect to the W-B coloring, then for each 
, there must exist at least one private neighbor 
, . Because 
, 
 will be adjacent to either 
 or 
, contradicting the assumption that 
 is a private neighbor of 
. Thus, if , then all  must get the color W. □

Before presenting the main algorithm, we present the main idea of the algorithm. Consider a circular-convex bipartite graph  with a circular ordering 
 defined on X. Let 
. By Observation 5.1, if we can color the vertices present in the set  with respect to the W-B coloring, then we can easily remove S from G. By Lemma 5.4, all the vertices in the set S are colored with the same color with respect to the W-B coloring.

First, we color all  with color W. Then, all  are forced to be colored with color B. Now all the vertices in  are colored, and it is easy to see that this results in a valid partial W-B coloring, say 
.

Next, we consider the case where we color all  with color B. By Lemma 5.4, . Now, for each , we choose a private neighbor  of s and color it with color B and the remaining vertices in set  with color W. If for some , there does not exist any private neighbor u, then we can not find a valid partial W-B coloring of G. Otherwise, we get a valid partial W-B coloring 
 of . Note that in this case, we need to consider at most  cases for each .

In this way, after getting a valid partial W-B coloring 
 of , we obtain a convex bipartite graph 
 for which we can find a valid total W-B coloring (if one exists) in polynomial time. We will then combine the valid total W-B coloring of graph 
 obtained by applying the algorithm in [13] with the W-B coloring of the set S, say 
 to get a valid total W-B coloring (hence a d.i.m.) of the circular-convex bipartite graph G [13].

Furthermore, we define a function 
. The main task of this function is to either extend the valid partial W-B coloring 
 of a given convex bipartite graph 
 to a valid total W-B coloring of 
 and to store its solution in 
 or to return 0, if the given valid partial W-B coloring of 
 can not be extended to a valid total W-B coloring.

We now present a polynomial time algorithm DIM-Circular-Convex(G), which either finds a d.i.m. in a given circular-convex bipartite graph if one exists or reports that none exists. The pseudocode of the algorithm is given in below:

Theorem 5.2

Algorithm DIM-Circular-Convex(G) correctly computes a d.i.m. in a circular-convex bipartite graph G in polynomial time, if and only if G admits a d.i.m. Otherwise, it reports that G does not admit a d.i.m.

6. Conclusion
In this paper, we strengthened the NP-completeness of the DIM-Decide for bipartite graphs by showing that this problem remains NP-complete for perfect elimination bipartite graphs, a proper subclass of bipartite graphs. On the positive side, we characterize star-convex bipartite graphs admitting a dominating induced matching. Based on this characterization, we proposed a linear time algorithm for the DIM problem for star-convex bipartite graphs. We have also proposed polynomial time algorithms for the DIM problem for long-k-star-convex bipartite graphs and circular-convex bipartite graphs, which are some important subclasses of bipartite graphs. The complexity status of the DIM problem is still unknown for graph classes like tree-convex bipartite graphs.
