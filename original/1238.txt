Abstract
The performance of a continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) protocol depends on the efficiency of the post-processing of measurement results. The post-processing methods extract statistical information from the raw data, establish the mutual knowledge between the parties, and produce a final key that provides absolute security. The post-processing phase is a bottleneck in CVQKD with crucial importance to the efficiency and protocol attributes. Post-processing uses the raw data of the parties generated by the quantum-level transmission and a classical authenticated channel to generate a secret key between the parties. The current reconciliation procedures require high-complexity coding with moderate resulting efficiency. Here we define an optimization method for post-processing in continuous-variable quantum key distribution. The reconciliation method achieves additive Gaussian noise on the random secret for arbitrarily low dimensional blocks. The model consumes all information from the raw data blocks to provide maximal efficiency and security via standard operations. The results can be realized by generic Gaussian coding schemes, allowing an easily implementation for experimental CVQKD protocols.

1. Introduction
As development of quantum computers [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [29] evolves the unconditional security provided by quantum key distribution (QKD) [21], [28] becomes more important for legal parties. In contrast to the single photon–based discrete-variable (DV) QKD systems, CVQKD protocols [21] are based on continuous-variable (CV) quantum states [17], [18], [19], [20], [27], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], and are implementable by the currently available optical devices and telecommunication networks [15], [16], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [77], [78], [79], [80], [81], [82], [83], [84], [85], [86], [87], [88], [89], [90], [91], [92], [93], [94], [95], [96], [97], [98], [99]. CVQKD protocols require no special devices for the practical realization of an unconditionally secure communication. In a CVQKD setting, the modulation of the CV quantum states, the measurement phase, and the decoding procedures of the quadratures of the CV states can be easily implemented in practice. In the quantum channel that connects the legal transmitter (Alice) and receiver (Bob), an eavesdropper (Eve) is also present who continuously attacks the quantum channel, adding Gaussian noise to the transmission. Since the physical-layer transmission of the quantum states results in a correlated bitstring (called raw data) between the parties but not a final key, further steps are needed in the logical layer using standard communication links and data processing steps. As the quantum transmission is closed, the post-processing methods are applied to the parties' correlated raw data. The post-processing methods utilize the results of the measurements of the quadratures of the CV quantum states that formulate the raw data. The post-processing methods extract statistical information from the raw data, establish the mutual knowledge between the parties, and produce a final key that provides absolute security.

Reconciliation is a post-processing method [41], [42], [43], [44], [45] in CVQKD protocols realized after the quantum-level transmission using a classical authenticated communication channel. The aim of the reconciliation procedure is to maximize the extractable information from the parties' raw data, to generate a final secret key between the parties from the raw data, and to achieve high secret key rates and improved transmission distances [41], [42], [43], [44], [45]. Without loss of generality, the raw data are a classical bitstring resulting from the measurements of the quadrates of the continuous-variable quantum states. As the quantum transmission is closed, the raw data blocks represent the mutual knowledge between the sender and the receiver. Since in the physical layer the quantum states are generated by a Gaussian modulation [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], the distribution of the raw data elements also follows a Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, since the optimal attack against any CVQKD protocol results in Gaussian noise, the noise on the raw data blocks is also Gaussian [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61]. The aim of the reconciliation procedure is to generate a secret key between Alice and Bob using the raw data shared between the parties and a uniform random secret. The uniform random secret is multiplied by a raw data block, and then the result is transmitted through a classical channel to the receiver. The reconciliation channel is a logical channel in the post-processing phase formulated by the manipulations of the raw data elements. In particular, the receiver divides this information with his/her local raw data unit (in a direct reconciliation, the direction is from Alice to Bob, while in a reverse case, the direction is from Bob to Alice), which results in the noisy secret unit. The noise on this secret unit has to be corrected. However, it is not a trivial problem, since first this noise distribution has to be characterized strictly, then an optimal method has to be constructed for the efficient realization of the reconciliation procedure.

In the current reconciliation approaches, achieving the Gaussian noise in the post-processing phase is a main challenge. This is because the raw data manipulations require the use of a classical authenticated channel that only allows the transmission of uniform distribution. Therefore, the parties cannot directly use the Gaussian distributed raw data that resulted from the quantum transmission; instead, auxiliary computations and operations are needed to achieve the desired uniform distribution (such as the multiplication). On the other hand, to apply efficient error correction in the reconciliation phase, the noise on the uniformly distributed random secret (from which the final key will be derived) also has to be Gaussian. To achieve this Gaussian noise on the uniform secret, several reconciliation techniques have been defined [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], such as multidimensional spherical coding [41], [42], [43], [44], with several limitations both on the efficiency, dimension (block length), achievable secret key rates, and general applicability.

Here, we define a novel reconciliation model that eliminates all the drawbacks of the previous reconciliation attempts. Our method is an easily applicable solution for post-processing optimization for CVQKD. The defined reconciliation procedure achieves the Gaussian noise for arbitrary block lengths (even for one dimension) and requires only the use of generic Gaussian error correction, without any further limitations. Our reconciliation procedure utilizes only a simple scaling step that is performed on the received noisy data to achieve the desired Gaussian noise on the uniform secret units. The aim of the optimization is therefore to find an appropriate model for the reconciliation channel and to determine the noise properties.

Here, we show that using a general reconciliation procedure [41], [42], [43], [44], the reconciliation channel in the standard case is analogous to a Rayleigh channel (a channel with a multiplicative noise, where the multiplicative noise is Gaussian distributed). We also prove that this multiplicative noise of the reconciliation channel can be evolved into a Gaussian noise via some simple scaling steps applied to the received data units. The results therefore make it possible to achieve the Gaussian noise without the use of spherical coding or other sophisticated coding methods. The proposed reconciliation model is implementable via generic Gaussian error correction. Since the method requires no large block lengths, the results make it possible to boost the secret key rates of existing CVQKD protocols. The defined framework has no restrictions on the direction of the reconciliation, nor on the physical-layer attributes of the quantum transmission, and is applicable for arbitrary CVQKD protocols.

The contributions of our paper are as follows:

1.
We prove that the reconciliation channel can be evaluated from an initial phase to a desired state via appropriate data step manipulations.

2.
We prove that, while in the initial case, the reconciliation channel is equipped with a multiplicative Gaussian noise, the resulting reconciliation channel will have an additive Gaussian noise (more precisely, an additive noise that is very close to a Gaussian noise).

3.
We define the steps that are required for the evaluation of the reconciliation channel from the initial to the desired state. We also study the noise characteristics of the reconciliation channel of each phase.

4.
The results make possible an immediate application of generic Gaussian error correction to optimize the post-processing of CVQKD protocols.

5.
The reconciliation model can be applied in arbitrary experimental CVQKD setting.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the system model is proposed. Section 3 proves the noise characteristics of the reconciliation channel. Finally, Section 4 concludes the paper.

2. System model
In this section we discuss the reconciliation model and define the reconciliation channel.

Proposition 1

In the reconciliation model, Alice has a Gaussian distributed raw data 
, where 
 is the modulation variance. Alice generates a uniform number U (secret), multiplies it by X, and sends UX to Bob [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44]. Bob receives it and divides it by his noisy Gaussian raw data 
, where is Δ the Gaussian noise of the quantum channel (Eve). The result is the noisy secret as 
, that can be rewritten as 
, where H is a multiplicative noise.

The system model is depicted in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. System model of the CVQKD post-processing. Quantum transmission phase: Alice draws a Gaussian raw data X, and using X she modulates the Aout CV quantum system. The modulated CV quantum system Aout is transmitted to Bob via the  Gaussian quantum channel (AWGN - Additive White Gaussian Noise). Bob measures 
 via an M measurement operator that yields the noisy raw data X′. Post-processing phase: Alice generates a uniform number U (secret), multiplies it by X, and sends UX to Bob [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44]. Bob receives it and divides it by his noisy Gaussian raw data X′ = X + Δ, where is Δ the Gaussian noise of the quantum channel (Eve). The result is the noisy secret as 
, that can be rewritten as 
, where H is a multiplicative noise.

Theorem 1

(The reconciliation-channel is a Rayleigh channel). The noise H on 
 is a multiplicative noise, and the reconciliation-channel 
 is a memoryless Rayleigh channel.

Proof

Let Alice's noiseless Gaussian raw data be 
, where 
 is the modulation variance. By some fundamental theory [62], [63], [64], the converted raw data UX has a mean 
 and variance 
.

Then, let 
 be the noisy Gaussian raw data of Bob,(1)
 where 
 is a Gaussian noise (added by the Gaussian quantum channel) with zero mean, , and variance 
, while 
.

The 
 channel model of the reconciliation procedure (reconciliation-channel) is as(2)
 where U is a uniform random number (secret), 
 is the noisy secret as(3)
 
 where h is as(4) while H is a multiplicative noise, evaluated from the quantity 
 as(5)
 
 
 
 from which the reconciliation channel 
 is defined as follows(6)
 thus H identifies a multiplicative noise as(7)
 
 Since in (7), Δ is the Gaussian noise of the quantum channel, the resulting H coefficient is a Gaussian random variable, 
 with variance 
.

Rewriting H as a ratio of two Gaussians(8)
 
 where 
, 
, and 
, 
 are Gaussian random variables with mean 
, 
 and variances 
, 
. From these variables, the PDF (probability density function) of H is derived as follows.

Since 
 and 
 are correlated Gaussian variables with different variances, the Hinkley distribution [62], [63], [64] yields the corresponding PDF for the ratio distribution 
, i.e., for the distribution of H in (8) as(9)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 where

(11)
 
 
 
(12)
 
 
 
(13)
 
 and(14)
 
 with 
 
 
.

These results confirm that H in (8) is a random multiplicative disturbance (fading), and the resulting reconciliation-channel 
 in (2) is therefore analogous to a memoryless Rayleigh fading channel in the post-processing phase. □

Lemma 1

The multiplicative noise H of the reconciliation channel 
 allows no efficient error correction in the post-processing phase.

Proof

Fading distributions statistically allow no high SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) performance transmission at a moderate complexity [46], [47]. In theory, for a Rayleigh channel, the fading coefficient changes independently of the channel uses [46], [47], [62], [63], [64] and neither the capacity nor the capacity-achieving input distribution is fully characterized for this channel. □

3. Methods
In this section, we prove the noise characteristics of the reconciliation channels.

In Theorem 1, we have shown that the reconciliation channel 
 has analogues with a Rayleigh channel. In Theorem 2, we prove that the noise of 
 can be converted into an additive form, which leads to a reconciliation channel  with additive non-Gaussian noise.

Theorem 2

The multiplicative noise H on 
 can be converted into an additive non-Gaussian noise W.

Proof

To achieve the evaluation of the reconciliation channel, as a first step, we modify at two points the noise model in (5). First, we assume that Bob, after he has divided UX by 
, corrects the result by the addition of a standard Gaussian variable 
 to 
 in (5); thus, the noisy evolution of a corrected reconciliation channel 
 is as(15)
 The output 
 of 
 has magnitude 
 and energy 
. Conditioned on , the output energy is 
, with PDF(16)
 
 
  The reconciliation channel 
 in a multiplicative form is as(17)
 where Q is independent of U, with PDF(18)
 for any .

Using (17), the magnitude can be rewritten as(19)
 Second, Bob will apply a scaling operator  on the magnitude 
 (see (19)) of the noisy 
 in (15), where  is defined as ; thus, the scaling yields(20)
 As can be concluded, after 
, an additive-noise channel equivalent  of the reconciliation channel 
 is yielded as(21)
 where V is the scaled input for reconciliation channel , defined as(22)
 
 
 where 
 in our model; thus, (22) is simplified into(23)
 
 and W is an additive noise (rescaled additive noise) on V as(24)
 
 with mean(25)
 
 where 
 is the Euler constant [46], and with variance(26)
 
 where  is the Riemann Zeta function [46], as(27)
 
 
 
 thus, (26) can be rewritten as(28)
 

The PDF of W is as(29)
 , and the CDF (cumulative distribution function) is(30)
 while the characteristic function is as(31)
 where(32)
 
 is the gamma function [46], [47].

Thus, the output of the reconciliation channel  is(33)
 In other words, 
 in (20) yields the  additive noise reconciliation channel equivalent to the original reconciliation channel 
 in (2) (not counting the addition of the standard Gaussian variable C to achieve the evaluation via 
 in (15)).

In the operational model, after Bob has applied (20), in the next step, the additive noise W on 
 is corrected, resulting in V. Bob then computes U from V as(34)
 
 where, since 
, (34) is simplified into(35)
 
 where 
 is the standard deviation of H.

To determine 
, we rewrite the H from (8) as(36)
 
 
 where  and  are independent standard Gaussian variables, while a and b are non-negative constants [65]. Then, selecting x and y such that  and  yields the closed form [65] for 
 as(37)
 
 where  is the mean of H as(38)
 

The description of the noise evolution of  is as follows. Since the inputs U of the original reconciliation channel 
 in (2) are drawn from a uniform distribution, the scaled V input (23) distribution for  represents an L-ary log-scale discrete uniform (LDU) input distribution. Since the LDU inputs are provably capacity-achieving distributions for the reconciliation channel  with the converted additive noise W [46], [47], the input distribution (23) is also capacity-achieving for .

Thus, since the U inputs are uniform, the scaled input V has a PDF as(39)
 
  where D is determined by 
 as(40)
 
 In theory, the scaled input V has PMF (probability mass function) [46], [62], [63], [64] as(41)
 
 for , where Ω is derived from 
, which is as follows:(42)
 
 In the noise evolution model of , the 
 operation in (20) is analogous to the case where Alice multiplies V by X and transmits VX to Bob over . Bob then receives VX and divides it by his noisy Gaussian 
, which results in 
. The output 
 is as follows:(43)
 
 where W is the additive noise as given in (24). The noisy 
 has a PDF as(44)
 
 where 
 is the PDF of W as given in (29), while 
 is the CDF of W as in (30).

These results conclude the proof. □

Theorem 3

The reconciliation channel  allows a capacity-achieving post-processing for any CVQKD protocol.

Proof

Let V refer to the scaled input of the reconciliation channel  as given in (23), and let 
 refer to the noisy output as given by (43). Since  (21) is the converted channel of 
 (2) with uniform input U, it can be concluded that(45)
 and 
 can also be evaluated as(46)
 where function  is the differential entropy function, and  is the differential entropy of the additive noise W of the reconciliation channel , as(47)
 
 
 where 
 is the PDF of W (see (29)), while 
 is the Euler psi function [46],(48)
 where(49)
 
 
 with 
 in (47).

Let the original SNR of 
 at input U be 
. Then, for the transformed channel  with the scaled input 
, the SNR is also rescaled as(50)
 Since in the reconciliation model the multiplicative noise H on U is a Gaussian random variable, in the asymptotic limit 
, the  capacity of the  reconciliation channel in the post-processing phase is yielded as(51) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 where χ is evaluated as(52)
 where 
 is the Euler constant.

As this can be verified at input V, the following conditions are satisfied for :(53) 
 
 and(54) 
 
 
 where 
 is the variance of V, while 
 is given in (28). As this can readily checked, the relations in (53) and (54) provide a sufficient and necessary condition for the capacity-achieving property over .

Since for input V, the SNR is related to D (as given in (39)) as(55)
 where 
 is given in (40), the inequalities(56)
 
 and(57)
 
 hold for the input distribution (see also (42) for Ω in (41)).

By combining (56) with (53) and (54), it follows that(58) 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Therefore, for the  achievable capacity of  with input distribution V,(59) 
 
 Thus, using V for the transmission yields the capacity-achieving input for .

Since the definition of the reconciliation channel is the same for all CVQKD protocols (with the proper adjustment of the model according to the direction of the reconciliation and the steps of the current CVQKD protocol run), the proof is concluded here. □

Lemma 2

The converted channel allows a high-performance reconciliation by generic coding designed for Gaussian channels.

Proof

To measure the Gaussianity of the additive noise W, we use the metric , , such that , only if the random variable X is a Gaussian random variable, defined for W as(60)
 where 
 is the negentropy function, defined as(61)
 where 
 is a Gaussian random variable with the same mean and variance as W:(62)
 where  is given in (25), while 
 is as shown in (28).

The 
 differential entropy of 
 is evaluated as(63)
 
 while  is as given in (47).

Therefore, (61) can be rewritten as(64)
 
 
 
 where 
 is the variance of a Gaussian random variable 
 with the same differential entropy as W [46], [47], i.e., 
 is as(65)
 
 Since (65) is satisfied for 
, (64) is yielded as(66)
 
 
 From (66), the metric  for the Gaussianity in (60) for W is therefore yielded as(67)
 which indicates that the additive noise W is close to a Gaussian random noise with the same mean and variance as W. As a corollary, generic channel coding schemes developed for standard Gaussian channels can be utilized for the reconciliation channel. Since (67) is small, a Gaussian decoding performs well in the reconciliation procedure. □

4. Conclusions
Here, we have defined an improved reconciliation scheme for CVQKD. The method requires no sophisticated coding approaches or complex operations to achieve a high-performance reconciliation in experimental CVQKD scenarios. The proposed model uses only standard Gaussian error correction to achieve the derivation of the final key for arbitrary dimensions. The scheme achieves Gaussian noise for arbitrarily low dimensional raw data blocks. The method also allows easy implementation in practice in arbitrary CVQKD protocols.
