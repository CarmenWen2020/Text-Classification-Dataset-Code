Abstract
The n-dimensional hypercube Qn is one of the most attractive interconnection networks for multiprocessor systems and it is a bipartite graph. Let Fv be a set of the end-nodes of k independent edges in Qn and Fe be a set of f edges in Qn−Fv. Given a linear forest L of Qn−Fv−Fe, in this paper, we prove that (i) Qn−Fv−Fe admits a hamiltonian cycle passing through L if |E(L)|+k+f≤n−2; and (ii) for any two nodes x and y of the opposite partite sets in Qn−Fv−Fe such that none of the paths in L has x or y as internal node or both of them as end-nodes, Qn−Fv−Fe admits a hamiltonian path between x and y passing through L if |E(L)|+k+f≤n−3; and (iii) for any two distinct nodes u and v of the partite set not containing w in Qn−Fv−Fe−w such that none of the paths in L has u or v as internal node or both of them as end-nodes, Qn−Fv−Fe−w admits a hamiltonian path between u and v passing through L if |E(L)|+k+f≤n−3, where w is an arbitrary node in Qn−Fv−Fe.

1. Introduction
A multiprocessor system is built according to a certain graph which has good graph-theoretical properties, and such a graph is called the interconnection network of the system. The n-dimensional hypercube 
 is bipartite, hamiltonian, n-regular, node-transitive, edge-transitive and recursive [18], and it has been an interconnection network for several multiprocessor systems. The path and the cycle are popular interconnection networks owing to their simple structures and low degrees, and some parallel applications such as those in image and signal processing are originally designated on them [14]. If a host interconnection network can embed a path or a cycle, then the applications on the path-structure or the cycle-structure can be simulated on the host systematically [14]. For this reason, the problem of embedding paths and cycles, especially hamiltonian paths and hamiltonian cycles, into hypercubes attracts much attention (see for example, [3], [13], [16], [22]). A bipartite graph G is hamiltonian laceable if it can embed a hamiltonian path between any two nodes of opposite partite sets [19], and hyper-hamiltonian laceable if  can embed a hamiltonian path between any two nodes of the partite set not containing a given vertex w [15]. Although 
 cannot embed a hamiltonian path between two distinct nodes of the same partite set, it is both hamiltonian laceable [19] and hyper-hamiltonian laceable [15].

In multiprocessor systems, failures of processors and/or links are inevitable. When embedding paths and cycles into faulty hypercubes, the faulty nodes and/or edges should be avoided. Thus, the problem of embedding paths and cycles into faulty hypercubes has been proposed and investigated in depth (see for example, [2], [4], [5], [8], [9], [12], [16], [17], [20], [21]). In particular, Sun et al. [20] studied the problem of embedding hamiltonian cycles and hamiltonian paths in hypercubes with faulty edges and/or disjoint adjacent node pairs. The main results can be restated as follows.

Theorem 1.1

Follow Sun et al. [20]
Let 
 be a set of the end-nodes of k independent edges in 
 and 
 be a set of f edges in 
, where . If , then 
 is hamiltonian.

Theorem 1.2

Follow Sun et al. [20]
Let 
 be a set of the end-nodes of k independent edges in 
 and 
 be a set of f edges in 
, where . If , then 
 is hyper-hamiltonian laceable.

As a corollary of Theorem 1.2, it can be derived that for a set 
 of all the end-nodes of k independent edges in 
 with  and , 
 is hamiltonian laceable, which can also be found in [9].

In multiprocessor systems, some links may have better performance than others and when designing routing algorithms, engineers hope that these links are involved. In this scenario, the problem of embedding cycles and paths passing through a prescribed linear forest, a graph each component of which is a simple path, attracts much attention (see for example, [2], [6], [7], [10], [11], [23]). A set  of two nodes in a graph G is compatible to a linear forest L if none of the paths in L has u or v as internal node or both of them as end-nodes. Denote by a path between u and v by . A bipartite graph G is m-prescribed hamiltonian laceable if for an arbitrary prescribed linear forest L of at most m edges in G, it can embed a hamiltonian path  passing through L for any two nodes u, v of opposite partite sets provided that  is compatible to L. In [11], Dvořák and Gregor researched the problem of embedding hamiltonian paths passing through prescribed linear forests, and proved the following.

Theorem 1.3

Follow Dvořák and Gregor [11]
 is -prescribed hamiltonian laceable for , and -prescribed hamiltonian laceable for  or .

Sometimes, links with better performance and faulty links may coexist. When embedding hamiltonian cycles and hamiltonian paths into hypercubes in this scenario, researchers hope that the faulty links are avoided and the better ones are involved. A bipartite graph G is m-prescribed hyper-hamiltonian laceable if for an arbitrary prescribed linear forest L of at most m edges in , where w is a given node of G,  can embed a hamiltonian path  passing through L for any two nodes u, v of the partite set not containing w provided that  is compatible to L. Motivated by the works in [9], [11], [20], in this paper, we will investigate the problem of embedding hamiltonian cycles and hamiltonian paths passing through prescribed linear forests in hypercubes with faulty disjoint adjacent node pairs and/or edges and prove the following results.

Theorem 1.4

Let 
 be a set of the end-nodes of k independent edges in 
 and 
 be a set of f edges in 
, where  and . Then 
 is -prescribed hyper-hamiltonian laceable.

Theorem 1.5

Let 
 be a set of the end-nodes of k independent edges in 
 and 
 be a set of f edges in 
, where  and . Then 
 is -prescribed hamiltonian laceable.

Proof

Let L be a prescribed linear forest with at most  edges in 
 and let x and y be two nodes in 
 of opposite partite sets such that  is compatible to L. There are n neighbors of y in 
, at most  of which such that they are in 
 or incident with some edge in L, or there are edges of 
 between y and them. Since , there is a neighbor z of y in 
 such that 
 and  and z is incident with none of . Therefore,  is compatible to L. Theorem 1.4 implies that 
 admits a hamiltonian path  passing through L. Thus  is a hamiltonian path of 
 passing through L and Theorem 1.5 follows. □

Theorem 1.6

Let 
 be a set of end-nodes of k independent edges in 
, 
 be a set of f edges in 
, and L be a linear in 
, where . If , then 
 is -prescribed hamiltonian, i.e., there is a hamiltonian cycle in 
 passing through L.

Proof

The statement holds trivially for 
. By Theorem 1.1, it also holds when . It remains the case that  and . Let . Then  is compatible to . By Theorem 1.5, 
 admits a hamiltonian path  passing through . Thus  is a hamiltonian cycle of 
 passing through L. □

The main results in [9], [11], [20] are proved mainly by mathematical induction, and so do those in this paper. We contribute some generalized results where both prescribed linear forests and hybrid faults are allowed. The difficulty of the proof is the construction of desirable paths under various distributions of the edges in the prescribed linear forest and the faulty nodes and/or edges. Comparisons of the main results in [9], [11], [20] and ours are shown in Table 1.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Preliminaries are introduced in Section 2 and Theorem 1.4 is proved in Section 3. Concluding remarks are covered in Section 4.

2. Preliminaries
The graph-theoretical terminologies, notations and operations used without definition here follow Bondy and Murty [1]. For a positive integer n, let 
 be the set of positive integers which don't exceed n. A maximal path in a given graph G is a path that cannot be extended to a longer path from either end-node in G.

The union  of two simple undirected graphs G and H is the graph with node set  and edge set . For a node v in G, denote by  the subgraph of G induced by v. For ,  is the subgraph of G after deleting all nodes in T and all edges incident with nodes of T. Abbreviate  as  for . Denote by xy the edge between two adjacent nodes x and y. Let 
 be the complete graph with node set 
. For 
,  (resp. ) is the graph with node set  and edge set  (resp. ). For 
, abbreviate  and  as  and , respectively.

The n-dimensional hypercube, denoted by 
, is a simple graph consisting of 
 nodes, each of which is an n-bit binary string. Two nodes are adjacent if and only if they differ in exactly one bit. An edge 
 is called an edge in dimension d if u and v differ in the 
 bit, where 
. A node in 
 is an odd node (resp. even node) if the sum of all bits of the node is odd (resp. even). Let X and Y be the set of odd nodes and all even nodes in 
, respectively. Then  is a bipartition of 
.

There are n different ways to decompose 
 into two disjoint copies,  and , of 
 by deleting all the edges in dimension d of 
 for an arbitrary 
, where each node of  has j in the 
 bit for . In the remainder of the paper, abbreviate  and  as 
 and 
, respectively. For an arbitrary node 
, the symmetric node 
 of x in  is the neighbor of x in . For an edge 
, the edge 
 is called the symmetric edge of xy in . For an arbitrary linear forest (or, an arbitrary subset of nodes and/or edges) M of 
, denote by 
 the restriction of M in .

The following three lemmas will be used in the proof of our main result in Section 3.

Lemma 2.1

Follow Dvořák [10]
Let 
, 
 be two distinct odd nodes and let 
, 
 be two distinct even nodes in 
 with . Then there are two node-disjoint paths 
 and 
 in 
 such that each node of 
 lies on one of the two paths.

Lemma 2.2

Follow Castaňeda and Gotchev [4]
Let x, y be two nodes of opposite parities in 
 with . Then 
 is hamiltonian laceable.

Lemma 2.3

3. Proof of Theorem 1.4
In this section, we will prove our main result Theorem 1.4. Given , let

 and 
 be a set of f edges in 
, where . Let w be a node in 
 and L be a linear forest of at most  edges in 
. For any two distinct nodes 
 of the partite set not containing w such that  is compatible to L, we will show that 
 admits a hamiltonian path  passing through L. It suffices to consider the case that , ,  and there is no singleton in L. Prove the above result by induction on n and it is trivially holds for 
. In the following, we assume that the result holds for

 for . Theorem 1.2 implies that the result holds for . It remains to consider the case that . Since , by the pigeonhole principle, there is some dimension d, say , such that none of the k independent edges and 
 lies in this dimension. Partition 
 into two disjoint copies,  and , of 
 along dimension n, where the 
 bit of each node in  is i for . Let
