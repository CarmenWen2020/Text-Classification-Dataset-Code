Abstract
Let S be a set of positive integers, and let D be a set of integers larger than 1. The game Image 1 is an impartial combinatorial game introduced by Sopena (2016), which is played with a single pile of tokens. In each turn, a player can subtract s∈S from the pile, or divide the size of the pile by d∈D, if the pile size is divisible by d. Sopena partially analyzed the games with S=[1,t−1] and D={d} for d≢1(modt), but left the case d≡1(modt) open.

We solve this problem by calculating the Sprague–Grundy function of Image 2 for d≡1(modt), for all t,d≥2. We also calculate the Sprague–Grundy function of Image 3 for all k, and show that it exhibits similar behavior. Finally, following Sopena's suggestion to look at games with |D|>1, we derive some partial results for the game Image 4, whose Sprague–Grundy function seems to behave erratically and does not show any clear pattern. We prove that each value 0,1,2 occurs infinitely often in its SG sequence, with a maximum gap length between consecutive appearances.

1. Introduction
The game of

Image 5
is an impartial combinatorial game introduced by Sopena [10]. Given a nonempty set S of positive integers and a nonempty set D of integers larger than 1, the game
Image 1
is played with a single pile of tokens. In each turn, a player can subtract  from the current pile, or divide the size of the pile by , if the pile size is divisible by d. Following the normal convention on impartial games, we will assume that the last player to move is the winner.
1.1. Other subtraction-division games
The game of

Image 5
is a subtraction-division game (where the i stands for integral). The first subtraction-division game studied was
Image 6
(Berlekamp and Buhler [1]), in which the pile size n can be replaced by  or . This game was analyzed by Fraenkel [3], [4] and Guo [7]. Fraenkel also studied a variant
Image 7
in which one rounds up instead of down, as well as the game
Image 8
, in which one can subtract any number between 1 and  or divide by t rounding down.
One can define a general class of games , in which the pile size n can be replaced by  for  or  for . Hence,

, and

Kupin [8] considered a variant of  in which the division move is to  and the game ends at .

1.2. Background on impartial games
An impartial game can be abstractly represented by a directed acyclic graph , in which the vertices V represent positions and the directed edges E represent legal moves. If  we say that w is an option of v. We denote the set of options of v by .

The positions in an impartial game are classified into P-positions and N-positions. From a P-position, if both players play optimally then the second (or previous) player will win, whereas from an N-position, the first (or next) player will win. The P- or N-status of a position is known as its outcome. Under the normal play convention (in which the last player to move is the winner), the outcome is recursively characterized as follows: A position is a P-position if and only if all its options are N-positions. In particular, terminal positions are P-positions.

Given games 
, their sum 
 is defined as the game with the following rules: In each turn, a player chooses some 
 and makes some legal move on it, leaving all other games untouched. The game G ends when all the component games 
 end.

Knowing the outcomes of the component games 
 is not enough to determine the outcome of their sum. In fact, if 
 and 
, 
 are both N-positions, then 
 could be either a P- or an N-position.

In order to be able to optimally play sums of games (under normal play convention), one needs a generalization of the notion of P- and N-positions known as the Sprague–Grundy function (or SG function for short) [6], [11]. The SG value of a position in a game is a nonnegative integer. Given a finite set , define  (mex stands for minimum excluded value). Then, for each position  recursively define(1) The SG function has the following two important properties:

•
 if and only if v is a P-position.

•
Let  denote the bitwise XOR of a and b written in binary. Let 
. Then 
.

Hence, knowledge of the SG function of the component games allows us to optimally play their sum.

1.3. Polynomial-time algorithms
Let G be a game played on a single pile of tokens. A position n in the game can be represented with  bits. Hence, computing  using the definition (1) takes exponential time in the size of the input. In order to be able to play the game efficiently, we need a polynomial-time algorithm for computing . One way to do this is to find an explicit characterization of , which immediately yields a polynomial-time algorithm.

1.4. Sopena's results on i-Mark
In [10], Sopena presented several results on

Image 5
. Regarding the normal-play version, he proved that, although the SG sequence of
Image 5
is aperiodic for every S and D, the outcome sequence for
Image 2
with  and  is periodic, with set of P-positions equal to Sopena also proved that the Sprague–Grundy sequence is 1-almost periodic if  or , and that for these cases the characterization can be calculated by a linear-time algorithm. He also studied the games
Image 11
for . Sopena raised several open questions, which include among them:
•
Do there exist S and D for which the outcome sequence of

Image 1
is not periodic?
•

1.5. Our contributions
Our second contribution concerns games of the form

Image 12
for k odd. Since in these games each position has at most two options, their SG function is bounded by 2. We find that the positions with SG value 2 form one or two geometric progressions, similarly to the case above. Some of these phenomena were previously observed by Choen and Gerchikov, as part of an undergraduate project [2]. See Fig. 1(ii–iii) and Section 3.
In all the above games, the outcome sequence is aperiodic.

In Section 3 we also state a conjecture which partially characterizes the SG sequence of all games of the form

Image 13
for  relatively prime.
Our third and final contribution concerns the game

Image 4
. This is arguably the simplest instance of a game in which . The SG sequence of this game seems to behave erratically, and we were unable to identify a precise pattern. We still try to establish some basic properties of this sequence, in the same spirit as previous works on other games with seemingly chaotic SG functions, such as the game of Wythoff [9], and the 3-row case of the game of Chomp [5]. We observe experimentally that for each , instances of the value i in the sequence are never missing for too long, meaning, for every i there seems to exist a constant 
 such that every interval 
 contains a position with SG value i. We prove the existence of 
 and 
, we leave the existence of 
, as well as a more precise characterization of the sequence, as open problems. See Section 4.

Proof

By induction on n. Since 
, if 
 then n has only subtraction options, and the claim follows easily.

If 
 then , which has SG value 1, so 
. If 
 then the subtraction options of n have SG values , while its division option is 
, which has SG value 0. Hence, 
.

Suppose n equals 
 or 
 for . The numbers 
 are divisible by d, and they satisfy(2)
 Therefore, the subtraction options of 
 have SG values , while its division option has SG value 1, so 
. Similarly, the subtraction options of 
 have SG values , while its division option has SG value 0, so 
.

Next, suppose 
 for . Then the subtraction options of n are the last  elements of

The subtraction options of

.

Similarly, for , the subtraction options of

Next, suppose n is the ith element of 
 or 
 for . Suppose first that n is not divisible by d. Then the subtraction options of n are the  preceding elements of 
 or 
. Their SG values equal  for some j, and so .

Now suppose n is divisible by d. Since the SG sequences of 
 are periodic with period t, and since , advancing d steps in 
 or 
 is equivalent to advancing one step. By (2) and induction on i, it follows that if the ith element of 
 (resp. 
) is divisible by d, then its division option is in a position congruent to  modulo t in 
 (resp. 
). Therefore, if 
 (resp. 
), then the SG value of the division option of n is included in the SG values of the subtraction options of n, so it has no effect on . Finally, if n equals 
 (resp. 
) then  equals 
 (resp. 
), whose SG value is t, which again has no effect on . □

Proof

The claim up to 
 is easily checked.

Consider 
, . Its subtraction option has SG value 1, and its division option is the second term of 
, which has SG value 0, so 
.

Now suppose 
, . If n is not divisible by k then only the subtraction option of n is present, and the claim is easily checked (including the cases in which  equals 
 or belongs to 
).

Hence, suppose n is divisible by k, and let  be the division option of n. If  then we can have 
 (if 
), or  (if 
, or 
 (if 
), or 
 (if 
), or 
 (if 
). If  then only the last three options are possible, namely 
 (if 
), or 
 (if 
), or 
 (if 
).

Since the SG sequences of 
 and 
 are periodic with period 4, and , increasing n by k in 
 is equivalent to increasing it by 3, and then z increases by 1.

Thus, when  and n starts at 
, the subtraction option of n goes through the SG values , and its division option 
 also goes through SG values , which implies that  goes through the values , as desired. Once 
, its subtraction option has SG value 1, while its division option  has SG value 2, so , as desired. As n continues from 
, the subtraction option of n goes through the SG values , and its division option 
 also goes through SG values , which implies that  goes through the values , as desired. Once n reaches 
, its subtraction option has SG value 0, and its division option 
 has SG value 2, so . Finally, when 
, its subtraction option has SG value 0, while 
, so .

When  is odd, the subtraction option of n goes through SG values , and its division option also goes through SG values , which implies that  goes through the values , as desired. Once n reaches 
, the subtraction option of n has SG value 0, while its division option is 
 which has SG value 2, so . When 
, the subtraction option of n has SG value 1, while its division option is the first element of 
, which also has SG value 1, so  as desired.

The case  even is like the last three subcases of . □

Proof

It is tedious but straightforward to verify the claim up to 
.

If n equals 
 (resp. 
), then the subtraction option of n has SG value 1, while its division option is the second element of 
 (resp. 
), which has SG value 0. Hence, .

Suppose n belongs to 
 or 
 for . If n is not divisible by k, then only the subtraction option of n is present and the claim is readily verified. Hence, suppose n is divisible by k. The SG sequences of 
 and 
 are periodic with period 4, and , so advancing n by k steps is equivalent to advancing it by one step. Hence, starting from 
 or 
, and advancing n in steps of k, the subtraction option of n goes through the values , and its division option goes through exactly the same values, implying that  goes through the values , as desired.

If 
 (resp. 
), then the subtraction option of n has SG value 0, while its division option is 
 (resp. 
), which has SG value 2. Hence, , as desired.

Finally, if 
 (resp. 
), then the subtraction option of n has SG value 1, while its division option is the first element of 
 (resp. 
), which also has SG value 1. Hence, , as desired. □

We conclude this section with a conjecture supported by our experiments:

Conjecture 4

Let n be any position in the game i-Mark() in normal play, where s and d are relatively prime. Then a necessary condition to have  is for one of the following properties to hold:
 The rest of the SG values iterate in s-tuples of zeros and ones.

4. Some results on i-Mark
In this section we take the first steps towards studying

Image 5
games with more than one division option. Specifically, we look at the game
Image 4
, which is arguably the simplest such case. The SG sequence of this game is composed of the values ; however, the sequence seems chaotic and does not show any clear pattern.
We used a computer program to calculate the maximum gap between consecutive appearances of each SG value. See Table 1.


Table 1. Maximum gap for each SG value for n ≤ 231 − 1 in

Image 4
.
SG value	0	1	2	3
maximum gap	4	8	19	240
These computer experiments seem to indicate that for each  there exists a constant 
 such that every interval 
 contains at least one position with SG value i. In this section we prove the existence of the constants 
, and leave the existence of 
 as an open problem. For 
 we obtain the optimal value 
.

The options of a position n in this game are determined by the remainder of n modulo 6. Recall that  for every n, and see Table 2.

Proof

Let . We clearly have , which implies that for  the Theorem holds. Now let  and let  be smallest such that  or . Hence,
  By Table 2, , so . This implies that either  or . Therefore the maximum gap is at most . Hence, we have proven the claim for all cases except for .

Now let , and suppose for a contradiction that  for all . Since , by Table 2 we must have so . Hence, we must have , and so , and . But then , which is a contradiction. □

Now given , suppose for a contradiction that  for all . Let . Hence  and . By Lemma 8 we have both  and . Furthermore we must have , , , , , , , . Moreover  so by Table 2 . Similarly  so . Therefore  and , and therefore(3)
 

Now we claim that . Indeed, otherwise we would have ,  contradicting (3).

Therefore  and  and , since the only successor of  is . This contradicts the fact that . □

5. Discussion
A precise characterization of the SG function of

Image 13
for  relatively prime is still missing.
Regarding the game

Image 4
, the existence of the constant 
 could probably be established in a very tedious way by a similar but more extensive case analysis. In any case, our partial results on
Image 4
do not provide any concrete help in playing this game. A more pressing open problem is to find a polynomial-time algorithm for its SG function.
