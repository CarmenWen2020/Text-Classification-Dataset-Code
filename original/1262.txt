Abstract
In this article, we first give two equivalent criteria for the existence of pullback complements along a universal morphism in a category in terms of the existence of pullbacks and co-universality of certain morphisms. Then we introduce the notion of admissible morphism and we characterize the existence of pullback complements in a partial morphism category along an admissible morphism in terms of the existence of pullback complements in its base category; when the base category is a certain admissible category. At the end we make a comparison between partial pullback complement rewriting and sesqui-pushout, double-pushout and single pushout rewritings, for an admissible match.

1. Introduction and preliminaries
There are several categorical graph rewriting techniques including the pullback (PB), [2], [3], double-pullback (DPB), [12], single-pushout (SPO), [10], [17], double-pushout (DPO), [6], [11], sesqui-pushout (SQPO), [5], reversible sesqui-pushout (RSQPO), [7], partial pullback complement (PPBC), [20], rewritings; and rewriting in the span categories, [18], etc. All of these approaches are based on the categorical concept of pullback, pushout and/or pullback complement. The definitions of sesqui-pushout, the reversible sesqui-pushout and the partial pullback complement rewritings are based on the concept of pullback complement.

In [5] it is shown that in certain categories the DPO, SPO and the SQPO rewritings coincide for left regular rules. The SPO and DPO have been compared in [14] and the PPBC has been compared with the DPB, SPO, DPO and SQPO rewritings in [20].

As far as the existence of the pullback complement is concerned, in [8], a criterion for the existence of pullback complement of every morphism f along a morphism m is given. In [5] under certain conditions the existence of a pullback complement of a morphism f along m is guaranteed. In [20], the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the pullback complement in a category, for a composable pair  with m mono, as well as the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the pullback complement in a partial morphism category, where the base category is weak adhesive VK, for a composable pair 
 with m mono, are given.

In this article, in the current section 1, we give the preliminary results that are needed in subsequent sections. In section 2, we characterize the existence of pullback complements in a category for arbitrary pairs  with m universal (i.e., whose pullback along every morphism exists), in terms of the existence of pullbacks and co-universality of the identity morphism

; and also in terms of the co-universality of the morphism

, where 
. In section 3, we introduce the notion of an admissible morphism (a concept more general than monomorphism) and we give some related results. In section 4, for certain adhesive categories , we characterize the existence of pullback complements in 
 for the pairs 
 with m admissible, in terms of the existence of pullback complements in  for the pairs . Finally in section 5, we compare the partial pullback complement rewriting with sesqui-pushout, as well as double-pushout and single-pushout rewritings, for admissible matches. To this end, we recall:
Definition 1.1

[1]. For a functor

Image 3

such that .
Definition 1.2

[16]. The square  is called Van Kampen(VK) if it is a pushout and for each commutative cube as shown below, where the bottom face is the given pushout and the back faces are pullbacks, the front faces are pullbacks if and only if the top face is a pushout.(1)

Lemma 1.3

[9]. In the Diagram (1), if the bottom square is VK, the side squares are pullbacks, then the top square is a pushout.

In fact one can easily verify that VK squares are pullback stable.
Lemma 1.4

[15]. In a VK square , if m is mono, then so is n and the square is a pullback.

Definition 1.5

[15]. A category with finite coproducts and universal coprojections is called extensive if for a given commutative diagram as shown below, where the bottom row is a coproduct, the two squares are pullbacks if and only if the top row is a coproduct.(2)

Lemma 1.6

[4]. In an extensive category coproducts are universal.

Definition 1.7

[4]. In any category, a coproduct with coprojections 
 and 
, is said to be disjoint if the coprojections are universal monos and the pullback of 
 along 
 is an initial object.

A category is said to have disjoint coproducts if all the coproducts that exist in the category, are disjoint.

Proposition 1.8

[4]. Extensive categories have disjoint coproducts.

Theorem 1.9

[15]. In an extensive category, pushouts along coprojections are VK.

Definition 1.10

[15]. A category with pullbacks and pushouts along monos is called adhesive if pushouts along monos are VK.

Lemma 1.11

[16]. Suppose  is an adhesive category. In the diagram below,  are monos and the left square is a pushout. If the outer square is a pullback, then so is the right one.(3)

Definition 1.12

[8]. A pullback complement for the composable pair  (i.e. sf is defined), is a composable pair 
 such that in diagram (4), the square 
 is a pullback and for every pullback square 
 and any morphism  with , there is a unique 
 with 
 and 
.(4)

Such a pullback complement is denoted by either of the squares.(5)

We call f the whole part of the partial morphism 
 and we say

Theorem 1.18

[20]. A pullback, 
, of a whole map m along a morphism 
 exists in 
 if and only if 
 and a pullback complement for the pair 
 exist in .

In this case 
 and

.

2. Pullback complement in a category
The characterization of pullback complements given in [8, Theorem 4.4] applies to the situation when the pullback complement of every morphism along a given morphism m exists. While in [5, Lemma 11], for a pullback complement of f along m to exist the conditions are that the pullback functor 
⁎
 and its right adjoint (partially at f) to exist and the evaluation map 
 to satisfy certain conditions. In [20], the pullback complements along monos are characterized. In this section we investigate the pullback complements along arbitrary morphisms and we give two characterizations for the existence of pullback complement of f along m, with the only assumption that m be universal. However in the first three lemmas and the theorem that follows, we give some results involving pullback complements, that are needed in the subsequent sections.

Lemma 2.1

Suppose  is an adhesive category and in the following diagram j is mono, the outer square is a pushout and the right square is a pullback complement. Then:

1.
There is a unique morphism i such that in the diagram below, the left square and the triangle commute. Furthermore i is mono.(6)

2.
 is a pullback complement for 

Proof

1.
By Lemma 1.4, k is mono and the outer square is a pullback. Hence p is mono and there is a unique morphism i such that  and . Notice that the left square is also a pullback.

To show i is mono, let

Image 20
be a pushout for
Image 21
. Then, in diagram below, the bottom square is a VK square and so there is a unique morphism t rendering commutative the front and the right faces of the cube. By VK property these squares are pullbacks.(7) By hypothesis the square  is a pushout. Since , there is a morphism u such that  and . So we have,  and . By assumption  is a pushout. Therefore  and so t is mono. Since monos are pullback stable, i is mono.
2.
Let in the diagram the outer square be a pullback.(8) Since the square  is VK, by Lemma 1.15,  is a pullback complement for . Since the outer square in Diagram (8) is a pullback and i is mono, it follows that the outer square in the diagram (9) is also a pullback. So there is a unique morphism n such that the triangle and the left square commute.(9)

Now n is the required morphism. □
Lemma 2.2

Suppose C is an adhesive category and in the diagram below, j is mono, the left square is a pushout and the outer square is a pullback complement. Then, γ is mono if and only if  is a pullback complement for .

(10)
Proof

Suppose γ is mono. Then the right square in Diagram (10) is a pullback. Since j is mono, so is i. Thus the pushout square is VK and so by Lemma 1.4, k is mono and the square  is a pullback.

In the following diagram, suppose the outer square is a pullback.(11) Since the right square in Diagram (10) is also a pullback, it follows that in the diagram shown below, the outer square is a pullback. Since the right square is a pullback complement, there is a unique morphism η making the left square and the triangle commutative.(12) Now by Diagrams (10) and (12), we have . Since γ is mono, . Therefore we get the commutative diagram.(13)

To show uniqueness, let 
 be another morphism rendering commutative the left square and the triangle in Diagram (13). Then by Diagram (10), 
. Thus Diagram (12) implies that 
. Therefore  is a pullback complement for .

Conversely, suppose  is a pullback complement for . At first we show that the square  is a pullback. To do this, let α and β be morphisms such that .

In the diagram below, the right square is a pullback complement by hypothesis and the left square is formed to be a pullback. Hence the outer square is a pullback.(14) By Lemma 1.11, the right square in Diagram (10) is a pullback.

Then in the following diagram, there exists a unique morphism 
 making the left square and the triangle commutative. So the left square is a pullback.(15) Now in the diagram (16), the outer square is a pullback and the top triangle is commutative. Since by hypothesis the right square is a pullback complement, there is a unique morphism λ rendering commutative the left square and the bottom triangle.(16) Now Diagrams (10) and (16) imply that . So by Diagram (14), .

Now we have the commutative diagram. Thus the square  is a pullback.(17) Now let r and s be morphisms such that . By pulling back the square  along γr, we get the diagram (18). Using r (respectively s), in the upper front diagram, since the square  is a pullback, we get a unique morphism 
 (respectively 
) making the left triangle and the upper front square commutative. Therefore 
. Similarly in the upper right square, 
. Now in the upper cube all faces are pullbacks and the bottom square is a pushout and so it is VK square.(18) Now by Lemma 1.3, the commutative upper square in Diagram (18) is a pushout; thus . Therefore γ is mono, as desired. □

Lemma 2.3

Let  be a category with pullbacks. Consider the right cube where the top face is a pushout and the bottom face is VK, the left and the back faces are pullbacks and ψ is the unique morphism that makes the front and the right squares commutative. If α and γ are monos, so is ψ.(19)

Proof

Since in the above diagram the bottom face is VK, the front and the right squares are pullbacks.

Now let . By pulling back the square  along d, we get the diagram (20). Using f (respectively g), in the upper front diagram, since the square  is a pullback, we get a unique morphism 
 (respectively 
) making the left triangle and the upper front square commutative. Since α is mono, 
. Similarly in the upper right square, since γ is mono, 
. Now by Lemma 1.3, the upper square is a pushout, thus .(20) □

Theorem 2.4

Consider the commutative diagram (21), where t and k are monos and both squares are pullback complements. Then there is a unique morphism r such that  and  is a pullback complement for .(21)

Proof

Since in the following diagram k is mono, the right square is a pullback and therefore so is the outer square.(22) Thus there is a unique morphism r rendering commutative the left square and bottom triangle in the diagram.(23) Now we show the square  is a pullback. Let α and β be morphisms such that .

In the diagram (24), by pulling back the morphism α along t, we get the left square, in which 
 denotes the pullback of t along α. Since the right square is a pullback complement, the outer square is a pullback.(24) Now in the following diagram, the lower square is a pullback, because k is mono. It can be verified that 
 makes the left triangle and the upper square commutative. It follows that the upper square is a pullback.(25) So in the diagram (26), there exists a unique morphism σ making commutative the bottom triangle and the left square.(26) Now we have the following diagram in which the upper triangle commutes. We show the lower one commutes too.(27) Since by Diagrams (23) and (26),  and 
 and in the diagram (28) the right square is a pullback complement, we get .(28) To show the uniqueness of σ, suppose 
 is a morphism such that 
 and 
. By Diagram (25), 
.

Using the pullback square on the right, we get a unique morphism ξ making the triangles commutative. So 
, and thus 
. By Diagram (21), 
, and so 
. Since t is mono, 
.(29) Now in the diagram (30), the triangle commutes by hypothesis and the left square commutes by Diagram (29). Since the right square is a pullback complement, 
.(30) This proves that the square  is a pullback. Thus since k is mono, so is r.

Now in the following diagram, suppose the outer square is a pullback and a morphism φ is given making the upper triangle commutative.(31) It follows that in the diagram (32) there is a unique morphism 
 rendering commutative the upper square and the left triangle. Thus the upper square is a pullback.(32) Since by Diagrams (31) and (32), 
, there is a unique morphism 
 such that the triangles in the following diagram are commutative.(33) Now 
 and so by Diagram (23), 
. Since r is mono, 
. On the other hand by Diagram (31), 
. Therefore φ is the unique morphism that makes commutative the left square and the bottom triangle in the diagram.(34) Since the right square in the following diagram is a pullback complement, we get a unique morphism 
 making commutative the left square and the lower triangle.(35) So in the diagram (36), the lower triangle is commutative. We need to show the left square commutes.(36) Using the pullback square on the right, we get a unique morphism δ making the triangles commutative.(37) We show  by showing that 
 and 
. The former equality holds by Diagram (37). To show the latter, by Diagrams (37), (35), (33) and (34) we have, 
. Since r is mono, 
. Then by uniqueness of φ in Diagram (34), . Hence 
.

To show the uniqueness of 
, let 
 be another morphism such that 
 and 
. Now 
. Then 
 and 
. So by Diagram (35), 
. Hence  is a pullback complement for . □

We now turn to the main result of this section which is investigating the existence of pullback complements. We need the following two lemmas first.

Lemma 2.5

Suppose

Image 53
is a universal morphism in a category . Let
Image 54
and
Image 55
be the product and the pullback functors, respectively. Then for each morphism
Image 56
in , 
 in .(38)
Proof

The equation 
 implies that 
 is a morphism in .

Now 
 follows from the commutative diagram.(39) □

Lemma 2.6

Let

Image 59
be a universal morphism in . For objects , the 
-co-universal morphisms
Image 60
in  correspond to the -co-universal morphisms
Image 61
in .
Proof

One can verify that the counit of the adjunction, given in Theorem 1.16, is 
.

So, using the fact that 
, we have a correspondence between the morphisms

Image 62
and
Image 63
as given by the diagram.(40) Now let
Image 62
be 
-co-universal in . Given
Image 65
in , we have 
. So there exists a unique morphism λ such that in the following diagram, the triangles are commutative.(41) By co-universality of ϵ, there is a unique morphism
Image 67
in  such that the right triangle is commutative in .(42) So we get 
, and then by Lemma 2.5, . Now using Diagrams (40) and (41) we have, 
. Hence there exists a morphism
Image 67
such that the triangle is commutative.(43) To show uniqueness, let
Image 70
be another morphism such that 
 in . We show 
. By Diagram (41), we need to show 
 and 
. The former follows from Diagram (40) and the fact that 
; and the latter follows from Diagram (40), Lemma 2.5 and equality 
. Now the uniqueness of ψ in Diagram (42) yields 
.
Conversely let

Image 63
be -co-universal in . Given a map
Image 71
in , we have 
 and therefore 
. So
Image 72
is a morphism in .
Then there exists a unique morphism

Image 67
in  such that the triangle is commutative.(44) By Lemma 2.5, 
 in . Now we have 
 if and only if  if and only if both φ and  render commutative the triangles in the diagram (45).
Obviously φ makes both triangles commutative.(45) For the second morphism, by Diagram (40) and Lemma 2.5, 
. Also by Diagrams (40) and (44), 
.

So there exists a morphism

Image 67
such that the triangle commutes.(46) To show uniqueness, let
Image 76
be another morphism in  such that 
 in . Now using Diagram (40) and Lemma 2.5, 
. Therefore by uniqueness of ψ in Diagram (44), 
. □
The following theorem gives two characterizations for the existence of pullback complements.

Theorem 2.7

Suppose  is a composable pair in  where the map

Image 59
is universal. Then the following conditions are equivalent.
1.
There is an object g in  such that the pullback complement for  is 
.

2.
There is an object g in  such that 
 and the morphism

Image 77
is 
-co-universal in .
3.
There is an object g in  such that 
 and the morphism

Image 78
is -co-universal in .
Furthermore, under each of the above conditions, the exponential 
 exists and is isomorphic to g.

Proof

 Let  be a pullback complement for the pair . So 
. To show

Image 79
is 
-co-universal, let the morphism
Image 80
in  be given.
Then there is a unique morphism ψ such that in the following diagram the left square and bottom triangle are commutative. So

Image 81
is a morphism in  and 
.(47) Therefore we have the commutative triangle.(48) To show uniqueness, let
Image 84
be another map such that 
. It follows that 
 makes the left square and the lower triangle in the pullback complement square of Diagram (47) commutative. Thus 
.
 Since

Image 85
is 
-co-universal in , the result follows by Lemma 2.6.
 Set 
. By hypothesis, we have the right pullback square, with

Image 86
being -co-universal.(49) Now suppose the commutative diagram is given, where the outer square is a pullback.(50) Since 
, there is a unique morphism
Image 81
such that the triangle is commutative.(51) On the other hand we have the commutative diagram.(52) Therefore 
. So we have the commutative diagram. Thus by definition of 
, we get 
.(53) To show uniqueness, let 
 be another morphism such that 
 and 
. Then by Lemma 2.5, 
. So 
, and therefore by co-universality of n, we get 
. Hence the pair  is a pullback complement for the pair .
Furthermore condition (3) implies the existence of 
 and that 
. □

3. Admissible morphisms
In this section we introduce the notion of admissible morphism and give some related results. In particular we prove that in adhesive categories admissible morphisms are pullback stable and that monos are admissible. We also show that in extensive categories if monos with domain A are coprojections of coproducts, then every morphism with domain A is admissible.

Definition 3.1

A morphism m in a category  is called admissible if for any pushout square , with j mono, the pair  is a pullback complement for the pair .

The following lemma establishes the uniqueness of  in the above definition.

Lemma 3.2

Suppose  is an adhesive category. If m is admissible in  then for any pushout square , with j mono, the pair  is the unique pushout complement for , in the sense that if 
 is a pushout square, with 
 mono, then the pair 
 is isomorphic to the pair .

Proof

Consider the pushout square, with j mono. Let 
 be another pushout complement for . By hypothesis,  and 
 are both pullback complements of  and so by Lemma 1.14, they are isomorphic.(54) □

Lemma 3.3

In adhesive categories admissible morphisms are pullback stable.

Proof

Suppose  is a pullback, where m is admissible. To show n is admissible, let 
 be a pushout with j mono. Lemma 1.4 implies that i is mono and 
 is a pullback.

In the cube shown below, the top and bottom squares are taken to be pushouts and so by Lemma 1.4, 
 and 
 are monos and the top and bottom squares are pullbacks.(55) Since the left and back squares are pullbacks, there is a unique morphism 
 making the front and right squares commutative and thus they are pullbacks, because the bottom square is VK. Since the left, bottom and top squares are pushouts and the other ones are commutative, the right one is a pushout. By admissibility of m, 
 is a pullback complement for 
. Now by Proposition 1.13, the pair 
 is a pullback complement for the pair  and so n is admissible. □

Lemma 3.4

In adhesive categories every mono is admissible.

Proof

Let m be a mono. Given a pushout square , with j mono, the square is VK. Now since m is mono, by Lemma 1.15,  is a pullback complement for . Therefore m is admissible. □

The following proposition gives a sufficient condition for admissibility.

Proposition 3.5

Suppose  is an extensive category. Given a morphism

Image 59
in . If monos with domain A are coprojections of coproducts, then m is admissible.
Proof

Let

Image 94
be mono in . By hypothesis, 
 is a coprojection of a coproduct. So there is an object 
 such that 
.
We need to show the pushout of 
 along m, which can be verified to be the right square in the following diagram, is a pullback complement.(56) We know it is a pullback, because the category is extensive. The left vertical arrow in the outer square is a coprojection, because the outer square is a pullback and the category is extensive.

In the following diagram, the left square is a pullback by Diagram (56) and the right square is formed to be a pullback.(57) Since the lower row is a coproduct, by Lemma 1.6, the upper row is a coproduct and so 
.

Now in the diagram below, the left square is obviously commutative. The commutativity of the lower triangle follows by the equality 
.(58) To show uniqueness, let

Image 98
be another morphism making the left square and the lower triangle in Diagram (58), commutative. Thus the square 
 is a pullback.
Now in the following diagram, the left square is a pullback and the right square is formed to be a pullback.(59) Since the lower row is a coproduct, so is the upper one.

Now in the diagram, since both rows are coproducts, by cancelativity in extensive categories, there is an isomorphism λ making the right square commutative.(60) Set 
. In the following diagram, by Diagrams (59) and (60), the left and right squares are pullbacks. Since the rows are coproducts, 
.(61) We have 
. Thus 
. It follows that 
. Now by Proposition 1.8, 
 is mono and so 
. Therefore 
, as desired. □

Example 3.6

A boolean topos, in particular the category Set of sets and functions, is extensive and every mono is a coprojection. So in such categories every morphism is admissible.

The following lemma is needed in the next section.

Lemma 3.7

Suppose  is an adhesive category and in the right cube, l is mono, r admissible, the top face is a pushout, the left and the back faces are pullbacks and the bottom face is a pullback complement. Then there exists a unique morphism φ making the front and the right squares commutative. Furthermore the right square is a pullback and if α and γ are monos, so is φ.(62)

Proof

The existence of φ follows from the fact that the top square is a pushout.

Let in the following diagram the left square be a pushout. By hypothesis the outer square is a pullback complement and l is mono. Since r is admissible, Lemma 2.2 implies the existence and monotonicity of θ.(63) In the cube, the top face is a pushout, the left and the back faces are pullbacks, and the bottom face is a pushout and thus VK. Therefore there exists a unique morphism ψ such that the front and the right faces are pullbacks.(64) Since  and , the uniqueness of φ yields . In the diagram the right square is a pullback, because θ is mono and the left one is a pullback by Diagram (64); therefore so is the outer square.(65) Now if α and γ are monos, then by Lemma 2.3, ψ is mono and thus so is φ. □

4. Pullback complements in a partial morphism category
In this section before proving the main result that states pullback complements along an admissible morphism exist in a partial morphism category if and only if they do in the corresponding base category, we establish a connection between the couniversality of morphisms in a partial morphism category and the couniversality in its corresponding base category.

Lemma 4.1

Suppose pullback complements along monos exist in . Let

Image 59
be a universal morphism in , 
 and 
. If the morphism
Image 106
is 
-co-universal in 
, then the morphism
Image 107
is 
-co-universal in .
Proof

By Theorem 1.18, the pullback 
 exists and equals 
.(66) The equation 
 gives the commutative diagram. So

Image 109
is a morphism in . To show it is 
-co-universal, let
Image 110
in  be given.(67) So 
 and thus 
. Since 
 is 
-co-universal, there is a unique morphism
Image 112
making the diagram commutative.(68) Since 
, by the diagram, 
 is an isomorphism.(69) By the definition of 
, we have the diagram.(70) To show 
, we need to show 
 and 
 as the following diagram shows.(71) By Diagrams (66), (70), (69), we have 
 
 
 
 
 
. So 
. On the other hand, 
. Therefore 
.
Now by Diagram (67), we have 
 
.

Since 
 is mono, 
, so we have the commutative triangle.(72) To show uniqueness, let

Image 118
be given making the triangle commutative.(73) We have, 
 if and only if 
 if and only if 
 if and only if 
, by Diagram (69), if and only if 
, by uniqueness of 
, if and only if
Image 120
is a morphism in  and the triangle commutes.(74) We have 
, thus the first condition holds.
So we need to show the triangle commutes. Using Diagram (66) and the equations 
 and 
, we get the commutative diagram.(75) So 
. Now Diagrams (67) and (73) imply 
. Therefore 
. So

Image 123
is 
-co-universal in . □
Corollary 4.2

Suppose pullback complements along monos exist in . Let

Image 59
be a universal map in , 
 and 
. If the map
Image 124
is 
-co-universal in 
, then the map
Image 125
is 
-co-universal in , where i is the mono part of 
.
Proof

Set 
. The result follows from Lemma 4.1. □

The following proposition is a sort of converse to Lemma 4.1.

Proposition 4.3

Suppose  is an adhesive category and pullback complements along monos exist in . Let

Image 126
be a composable pair in 
, with m an admissible map in . If there exist an object h in  and 
-co-universal morphism
Image 127
in , then there exist an object 
 in 
 and an 
-co-universal morphism
Image 128
in 
 such that ε is a morphism in .
Proof

We construct the following diagram as explained below, and we obtain the maps 
 and ε.

• Pullback h along m to get the square , so that 
.

• Since

Image 129
is a morphism, the triangle in the diagram (76) commutes.
• Take the pullback complement of 
 to get the square 
. Since 
 is mono, by Lemma 1.14 so is 
.(76) • Pushout 
 along n to get the square 
. Since 
 is mono, so is 
.

Since m is admissible, Lemma 3.3 implies that n is admissible and so the pair 
 is a pullback complement for the pair 
. Therefore by Theorem 1.18, 
. Diagram (76) yields that

Image 131
is a morphism in 
.
By Theorem 1.18, m is a universal morphism in 
. To show the morphism

Image 132
is 
-co-universal, let the morphism
Image 133
in 
 be given. We need to find a morphism
Image 134
.
By using the fact that 
, we obtain the diagram in which the lower left square is a pullback complement, the other squares are pullbacks and the triangles commute.(77) By Diagram (77), 
. Since ν is 
-co-universal, there exists a unique morphism

Image 136
making the triangle commutative.(78) Note that 
 is given according to the diagram.(79) Using Diagram (78), since in the diagram below, the right square is a pullback complement, there exists a unique morphism θ rendering commutative the left square and the bottom triangle.(80) Now we form the right pushout. By Lemma 1.4, u is mono. Furthermore since m is admissible, by Lemma 3.3, so is 
 and therefore 
 is a pullback complement for 
.(81) By Diagrams (80), (76) and (79), we have 
. So there exists a unique morphism λ making commutative the triangles in the diagram.(82) In the cube shown below, by Diagrams (79) and (80), the back and the left faces are pullbacks; by Diagram (81), the upper face is a pushout; by Diagram (76), the lower face is a pushout and thus VK and by Diagram (82), the right and the front faces are commutative and so they are pullbacks.(83) Since by Diagram (77), 
 and 
 is mono, the left square in the following diagram is a pullback. The back square is obviously a pullback. By Diagram (81), the top square is a pushout; and by Diagram (76), the bottom square is a pullback complement. Now by Lemma 3.7, there exists a unique mono 
, such that the right square is a pullback and the front square is commutative.(84) In the diagram below, by Diagrams (79), (83) and (84), the triangles commute and the square is a pullback. So 
, in other words
Image 144
is a morphism in 
.(85) Now we explain what the morphism 
 is. Form the cube shown on the right by pulling back the bottom pullback complement square along 
. Since by Proposition 1.13, pullback complements are pullback stable, the top face is a pullback complement.(86) Now by Diagrams (81) and (86), the outer and the right squares in the following diagram are pullback complements. So by Lemma 1.14, there exists a unique isomorphism τ making the left square and the lower triangle commutative.(87) Set 
. We show 
, by showing in the diagram below, the upper triangle and the left square are commutative.(88) Using Diagram (86), the lower square in the following diagram is a pullback. The upper square is a pullback, because τ is an isomorphism. Since by Diagram (87), 
, the outer pullback square is the square 
.(89) Also by Diagrams (87) and (86), we have 
. Finally using Diagrams (79) and (80), we get the following diagram.(90) Now by Diagrams (90) and (77), 
 and by Diagrams (82) and (90), 
. So 
.
Next we show that the morphism 
 makes the triangle commutative.(91) Using Diagrams (77), (84), (90) and the fact that c is mono, we get the diagram, in which the left squares are pullbacks and the right one is a pullback complement.(92) By Diagrams (84) and (89), we get 
 and so by (92), we get 
.

Now in the following diagram, by Diagram (80) and the fact that 
, both triangles commute. So 
, and Diagram (91) commutes, as desired.(93) Finally to show uniqueness, let

Image 154
be another morphism satisfying 
. Since 
, we have the commutative diagram, with the square being a pullback.(94) Setting 
, by Diagram (94),
Image 156
is a morphism in . So we have the diagram in which the right and the outer squares are pullbacks. Therefore the left square is also a pullback.(95) In the right cube, by diagrams (76), (94) and (95), the front, the right and the top squares are pullbacks. The botom square is obtained by pulling back γ along a. Since 
, there exists a unique morphism y such that the left and the back squares are commutative and thus pullbacks.(96) By Diagram (76), the front face is a pullback complement. Since all the faces are pullbacks, by Proposition 1.13, the back face is a pullback complement too. By Diagram (77),  is a pullback complement for 
 and by Diagram (94), 
. Hence Theorem 2.4 implies that there is a unique morphism r such that  is a pullback complement for the pair 
 and .
So we have the diagram that shows 
.(97) Now Diagrams (95) and (96) and the equality  give the commutative diagram with the square being a pullback. Thus 
 and so by Diagram (77), 
.(98) Therefore by Diagrams (76) and (97), we have the commutative diagram, in which both squares are pullbacks. It follows that 
.(99) Since 
, there is an isomorphism ζ such that in the diagram, the triangles are commutative.(100) By Diagrams (100) and (84), 
. Since r is mono, 
.

In the following diagram, the right and middle squares are pullbacks, by Diagrams (76) and (96); and the lower triangle commutes by Diagram (100).(101) So there exists a unique morphism ρ rendering commutative the left square and the upper triangle. Since 
 is mono, the commutativity of the left square implies that  and thus 
. Now by uniqueness of ψ in Diagram (78), .

In the diagram below, the right square is a pullback complement by Diagram (76) and the upper triangle commutes by Diagram (78). By Diagram (101), the left square and the lower triangle commute. So By uniqueness of θ in Diagram (80), 
.(102) In the cube, the front square is a pullback, because ζ is an isomorphism; by Diagrams (79) and (102), the back and the left squares are pullbacks; Since 
 the right square is a pullback and by Diagram (76) the bottom square is a pushout and thus VK.(103) Diagram (96) and the equality 
 yield the commutativity of the upper square. Since the bottom square is VK, the upper square is a pushout. Now in the following diagram, the outer square is a pushout by Diagram (103) and the inner square is a pushout by Diagram (81). So there is a unique isomorphism δ making the triangles commutative.(104) Since 
, by Diagram (104), we have 
; and since 
, by Diagram (104), we have 
. Now uniqueness of λ in the Diagram (83), implies .

By Diagrams (104) and (94) we have 
. Now since 
 is mono, the square 
 is a pullback.

By Diagrams (104), (97) and (100), we get 
. Now uniqueness of 
 in Diagram (84) implies that 
. Now we have  and 
, thus 
. This proves the uniqueness of 
.

Thus ε is co-universal. □

The Theorem below establishes a connection between pullback complements in a partial morphism category and it base category.

Theorem 4.4

Suppose  is an adhesive category and pullback complements along monos exist in . Let

Image 59
be admissible in  and 
. Then a pullback complement for 
 exists in 
 if and only if a pullback complement for  exists in .
Furthermore if 
 is a pullback complement for 
 and 
 is a pullback complement for , then 
 and we have the diagram in which the left square is a pushout and the right square is a pullback complement.(105)

Proof

 Suppose the pair 
 is a pullback complement for the pair 
. Since by Theorem 1.18, m is universal in 
, Theorem 2.7, implies that 
 and

Image 168
is 
-co-universal in 
.
Since 
, by Theorem 1.18, in the diagram below, the left square is a pullback complement and the right one is a pullback and so 
.(106) Also by Lemma 4.1, the 
-co-universality of

Image 168
yields the 
-co-universality of
Image 79
in . So Theorem 2.7 implies  is a pullback complement for  in . To show the left square in Diagram (106) is a pushout, consider the following diagram in which the left square is taken to be a pushout and the right one is a pullback complement. Since m is admissible, by Lemma 3.3, so is n. Thus the left square is a pullback complement.(107) Using Diagram (107), Theorem 1.18, implies that 
.
Now consider the following commutative diagram in which the right square is a pullback, the upper left square is obviously a pullback complement and the lower left one is both a pushout and a pullback complement.(108) Since

Image 79
is 
-co-universal in , Proposition 4.3 implies that
Image 172
is 
-co-universal in 
. Now by Theorem 2.7, 
 is a pullback complement for 
. Since 
 is also a pullback complement for 
, by Lemma 1.14, there is an isomorphism λ such that 
 and 
 and so 
 and 
. Now the pushout square 
 yields that the left square in digram (106) is a pushout, as desired.
 Let  be a pullback complement for . Theorem 2.7 implies that 
 and

Image 79
is 
-co-universal.
In the commutative diagram below, the right square is a pullback, the upper left square is obviously a pullback complement and the lower left square is taken to be a pushout and thus it is a pullback complement, because m is admissible.(109) Since the morphism

Image 79
is 
-co-universal, by Proposition 4.3, so is the morphism
Image 168
in 
. Now by Theorem 2.7, 
 is a pullback complement for 
 and we have Diagram (105) as desired. □
5. Graph rewriting
In [20], for certain categories, the comparison of the partial pullback complement rewriting with some other rewritings is only given for mono matches. In this section, we compare partial pullback complement rewriting with sesqui-pushout, double pushout and single pushout rewritings for admissible matches, thus extending the results given in [20]. We first recall:

Definition 5.1

Image 185
and a match

, is given by the right pullback complement square in 
.(114)
We also recall the following lemma that is needed in the theorems that follow.

Proposition 5.2

[20]. Let

Image 188
be a left linear rule and
Image 189
be any match in a category .

If

Image 190
, then
Image 191
.
2.
If a pullback complement for the pair  exists and

Image 191
, then
Image 190
.
Theorem 5.3

Suppose  is an adhesive category and pullback complements along monos exist in . Let

Image 192
be a right linear rule. For any admissible match
Image 193
in ,
Image 194
if and only if
Image 195
.
Proof

Image 196
if and only if a pullback complement of  exists in 
, by Theorem 4.4, if and only if we have the diagram in which the left square is a pullback complement and the right one is a pushout, if and only if
Image 197
.(115) □
Theorem 5.4

Suppose  is an adhesive category and pullback complements along monos exist in . Let

Image 199
be a linear rule. For each admissible match
Image 193
,
Image 200
implies
Image 201
. Furthermore if a pushout complement for  exists, then
Image 201
if and only if
Image 200
Proof

Existence of DPO implies that in the diagram below, both squares are pushouts. Now by Lemma 1.15,  is a pullback complement for the pair . Thus Theorem 4.4 implies  is a pullback complement for .(116) Now suppose

Image 203
. By Theorem 5.3,
Image 204
. So we have the diagram where the left square is a pullback complement and the right one is a pushout.(117) Now suppose 
 is a pushout complement for . By Lemma 1.15, 
 is a pullback complement for . So there is a unique isomorphism γ such that the two triangles in the diagram commute.(118) Therefore the square  is a pushout. Hence
Image 207
. □
Theorem 5.5

Suppose  is an adhesive category and pullback complements along monos exist in . Let

Image 208
be a linear rule. For each admissible match
Image 209
,
Image 201
implies
Image 191
. Furthermore if a pullback complement for  exists then
Image 201
if and only if
Image 191
Proof

Let

Image 203
. By Theorem 4.4, in the following diagram, the lower left square is a pullback complement and the lower right square is a pushout. Now Theorem 3.2 in [14], implies that the square  is a pushout in 
. Hence
Image 210
.(119) Now let the pullback complement for  exists. Then by Proposition 5.2 and Theorem 5.3,
Image 210
if and only if
Image 204
if and only if
Image 203
. □
The following examples are to show that the results obtained in Theorem 5.3, Theorem 5.4, Theorem 5.5 do not hold in general.

Example 5.6

Let  be the category generated by the following diagram, with , , , and squares (1) and (2) commutative. It is not hard to verify that:

•
m is admissible.

•
the universal monos, besides the identities, are  and hn.

•
the square (1) is both a double pullback complement and a pushout.

•
the squares (2) and  are double pullback complements but not pushouts.

Since Diagram (1) is a pullback, Diagram (2) is a pullback complement and l and h are universal monos, by Theorem 1.18 the following diagram is a pullback in 
. To prove the above diagram is in fact a pullback complement in 
, we need to show that given morphisms 
 and 
, rendering pullback the outer square in the following diagram, there is a unique 
 making the triangle and the left square commutative. One can check that:
•
if 
 and 
, then 
.

•
if 
 and 
, then 
.

•
if 
 and 
, then 
.

•
if 
 and 
, then 
.

•
if 
 or , then its pullback along m does not exist.

•
if 
, then its pullback  does not factor through .

•
if 
 and 
, then 
.

•
if 
 and 
, then 
.

•
if 
 and 
, then 
.

•
if

, then 
.

•
if 
 and 
, then 
.

•
if 
 and 
, then 
.

•
if 
 and 
, then 
.

Thus Diagram (3) is a pullback complement in 
. It follows that for the admissible match m and the right linear rule
Image 215
, we have
Image 216
. On the other hand it is not hard to see
Image 217
holds, however
Image 218
and
Image 219
do not hold.
We can also easily verify that in the following diagram, the left square is a pullback complement and a pushout, while the right one is a pushout but not a pullback complement (not even a pullback). It follows that the following diagram, is not a pullback and so not a pullback complement in 
. It follows that for the admissible match m and the right linear rule

Image 222
, the
Image 216
does not hold. On the other hand it is not hard to see
Image 218
and
Image 219
hold, while
Image 217
does not.
Example 5.7

Let  be the category generated by the following diagram, with , , , ,  and the squares (1) and (2) commutative. It can be easily verified that:

•
m is admissible.

•
the universal monos, besides the identities, are  and h.

•
the square (1) is both a double pullback complement and a pushout.

•
the squares (2) and  are double pullback complements but not pushouts.

Similar to Example 5.6, one can verify that the following diagram is a pullback complement in 
. Since Diagram (2) is not a pushout in C, the following diagram is not a pushout in 
, see [5]. So for the admissible match m and the linear rule
Image 226
,
Image 216
and
Image 217
hold, while
Image 227
,
Image 218
and
Image 219
do not hold.
Example 5.8

Let  be the category generated by the following diagram, with , , , , ,  and squares (1) and (2) commutative.

Similar to the previous examples one can show that m is admissible and that for the admissible match m and the linear rule

Image 226
,
Image 227
,
Image 218
and
Image 219
hold, while
Image 216
and
Image 217
do not hold.
