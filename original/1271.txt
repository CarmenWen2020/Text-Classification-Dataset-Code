Abstract
With the rapid expansion of the scale of multiprocessor systems, the importance of fault tolerance and fault diagnosis is increasingly concerned. For an interconnection network G, the h-component connectivity is an important indicator for evaluating the fault tolerance of G, which is defined as the minimum number of vertices whose deletion will disconnect G such that the remaining has at least h components. The h-component diagnosability, a newly precise diagnosis strategy to analyze the reliability of G, is the diagnosability under the condition that the number of components is at least h in the resulting graph after removing the faulty processor set. The -diagnosability is a classic imprecise diagnosis strategy, which can identify up to t faulty processors by sacrificing accuracy to a certain extent, namely misdiagnosing at most k fault-free processors. In this paper, we investigate some combinatorial properties and the fault tolerance ability of the n-dimensional Bicube network, denoted by . Then we first prove that the -component connectivity of  is  (, ). Moreover, we derive that the -component diagnosability of  is  under the PMC model and MM⁎ model (, ). Furthermore, under the PMC model, we propose the -diagnosis algorithm of  and then derive that  is -diagnosable (, ).

1. Introduction
Multiprocessor systems provide high-speed distributed computing capabilities for accelerating the development of cloud computing. Unfortunately, the massive scale of multiprocessor systems is often inevitably accompanied by the problem of processor failure. As the two most fundamental considerations to analyze the reliability of multiprocessor systems, fault tolerance and fault diagnosis are more and more critical with the increasing number of processors. A multiprocessor system usually takes an interconnection network as its underlying topology. Moreover, an interconnection network can be deemed as an undirected graph by regarding each processor as a vertex and the link between each pair of vertices as an edge. Thus, we can explore some parameters of such a undirected graph to evaluate the reliability of a multiprocessor system. Multiprocessor systems, interconnection networks, and graphs would be used interchangeably in this paper.

The connectivity of a graph G, denoted by , is defined as the minimum number of vertices whose deletion will disconnect G. The connectivity is a classic indicator for reflecting the fault tolerance of systems. However, since such an indicator considers the unlikely situation that all neighbors of a processor can be faulty simultaneously, its value is usually limited by the minimum vertex degree of G. Given this, Harary et al. [1] introduced the concept of conditional connectivity, which demands that the faulty processor set cannot consist of all neighbors of a processor. Based on the concept of conditional connectivity, Chartrand et al. [2] proposed a new measure, the h-component connectivity, which is defined as the minimum number of vertices whose deletion will disconnect G such that the remaining has at least h components. Hsu et al. [3] explored the -component connectivity of the n-dimensional hypercube with . As an extension of the results in [3], Zhao et al. [4] established the -component connectivity of the n-dimensional hypercube for . Gu et al. evaluated the -component connectivity of hierarchical star networks [5] for , bubble-sort star graphs [6] for , burnt pancake graphs [6] for , balanced hypercubes [7] for . Lin et al. [8] investigated the -component connectivity of split-stars for . Li et al. [9] established the relationship between extra connectivity and component connectivity in general networks.

Given all processors of a system, the process of identifying faulty processors among them is known as system-level diagnosis. Several diagnosis models at system-level have been proposed. The PMC model is a classic test-based model, which is first introduced by Preparate, Metze, and Chien [10]. To execute fault diagnosis in a system, this model assumes that a processor (tester) will send a test message to its neighbor (testee), where we denote the tester as u and the testee as v. Such a test can be represented by the ordered pair . If u is fault-free, according to the outcome of , we can deduce the state of v. Namely, when the outcome of  is 1 (resp. 0), v is faulty (resp. fault-free). However, if u itself is faulty, then the outcome of  is unreliable and the state of v is uncertain. Another classic diagnosis model, named the MM model, is a comparison-based model which is presented by Maeng and Malek [11]. Under the MM model, a processor w, called a comparator, can send two same tests to its two adjacent processors, and then compares their responses. Such a comparison is denoted by 
. If the comparator w is fault-free, the states of u and v can be analyzed depending on the outcome of 
. If the comparator w is fault-free, when the outcome of 
 is 0, both processors u and v are fault-free, otherwise there exists at least one faulty processor between them. If the comparator w is faulty, then the outcome of 
 is random and unreliable. Evolved from the MM model, the MM⁎ model was proposed by Sengupta and Dahbura [12], which assumes that each processor in the system should send test messages to each pair of its neighbors and compare their responses.

Fault diagnosis strategies can be divided into precise and imprecise. Given a system G with at most t faulty processors, if all the faulty processors can be identified, then we call system G is t-diagnosable. The diagnosability, a traditional metric based on precise diagnosis strategy, is defined as the maximum number of faulty processors that a system can correctly identify at system-level diagnosis. The diagnosability of many various interconnection networks have been established [13], [14], [15]. However, since it doesn't exert any limitation on the faulty processors' distribution pattern, the value of diagnosability is usually quite small [17]. To achieve a larger diagnosability, Lai et al. [18] proposed the notion of the conditional diagnosability, which assumes that all neighbors of a processor cannot be faulty at the same time. By generalizing the notion of conditional diagnosability, Zhang et al. [19] recently proposed a novel precise diagnosis strategy, called h-component diagnosability 
, which is defined as the maximum number of processors can be identified under the condition that the remaining has at least h components after removing all faulty processors from G. In addition, they showed that for the n-dimensional hypercube with , its -component diagnosability is 
 
 
 with  and its -component diagnosability is 
 
 
. However, the diagnostic ability of precise diagnosis strategy is limited in a multiprocessor system with large-scale faulty processors. In order to improve the diagnostic ability of the system, Somani et al. [16] proposed a classic imprecise diagnosis strategy, the -diagnosis strategy, which can detect up to t faulty processors at the expense of allowing at most k fault-free processors to be misdiagnosed as faulty. The -diagnosability is the diagnosability based on -diagnosis strategy. Lv et al. [20] established the -diagnosability of star graphs under the PMC model. Li et al. [21], [22] evaluated the -diagnosability of data center networks DCell under the PMC model and MM⁎ model. Xu et al. [23] established the -diagnosability of the -arrangement graph under the PMC model.

Designing an attractive interconnection network is a necessary task. The n-dimensional hypercube 
, one of the most popular interconnection networks, is scalable, symmetric and has a logarithmic diameter, simple routing and broadcasting algorithms. However, it also has some defects. The diameter of the hypercube is too large, which is closely related to the maximum step when transmitting messages. In order to achieve a lower diameter than that of the hypercube, Bicube networks was presented by Lim et al. [24], which is produced by interconnecting two isomorphic hypercubes according to several certain rules. We denote the n-dimensional Bicube network by 
. Compared with hypercubes, 
 preserves many desirable properties, including vertex-symmetry, bipartiteness, hamiltonian and bipancyclic. Moreover, it is highly edge-symmetric and has about half the diameter of a comparable hypercube.

Although the Bicube network possesses many excellent topological properties, since the researches on its capabilities of fault tolerance and self-diagnosis aren't yet complete, it hasn't been widely applied to construct multiprocessor systems. Moreover, in a multiprocessor system G with a set of faulty processors F, its -component connectivity, -component diagnosability and -diagnosability are all closely related to the size of maximal connected component in . Based on the above motivations, we have made some contributions as follows.

•
We analyze the combinatorial and fault tolerant properties of the n-dimensional Bicube 
. These results will be helpful for the follow-up discussions.

•
Based on the results obtained above, we deduce the following three important theorems:

Theorem 1. 
 
 for .

Theorem 2. 
 
 under the PMC model and MM⁎ model for , .

Theorem 3. 
 is 
 
-diagnosable under the PMC model (, ).

We organize the remainder of this paper as follows. Section 2 lists some necessary terminologies and notations, introduces the concept of PMC model and MM⁎ model, and presents the definition and several related lemmas of 
. Section 3 focuses on the -component connectivity of 
. Section 4 aims to address the -component diagnosability of 
 under the PMC model and MM⁎ model. In Section 5, under the PMC model, we propose the -diagnosis algorithm of 
 and establish the -diagnosability of 
. Section 6 concludes this paper and shows future works.

2. Preliminaries
In Section 2.1, we first present some important terminologies and notations. Section 2.2 shows two classic diagnosis models at system-level, namely the PMC model and MM⁎ model. In Section 2.3, we first provide the concept of n-dimensional hypercube, and then introduce the structure of n-dimensional Bicube 
, further give some basic lemmas.

2.1. Terminologies and notations
For terminologies and notations not defined here, we follow the reference [25]. An undirected graph, represented by , can be deemed as a system, where vertex set  consists of all processors in the system and edge set  denotes the links among processors. Given a vertex , all the neighbors of u in G are represented by a set 
. The total number of neighbors of u is defined as the degree of u, denoted by 
. Let 
 and 
. Let  be the number of vertices in the largest component of G. A path of a graph is a sequence of distinct vertices so that there is an edge joining consecutive vertices, whose length is the number of vertices in the sequence minus 1. Represent a path of length l by 
. The (shortest) distance between two vertices u and v, defined as , is the minimum value of l that paths from u to v can be achieved. For any two vertices u and v, we use  to represent the number of common neighbors of u and v.

Let . The subgraph induced by F of G is represented by , which is a graph consists of the vertex set F and the edge set .  is deemed as . Let 
 and  
 
 and 
. A component is defined as the maximal connected subgraph of G. When the total number of vertices of a component is odd (resp. even), we call such a component an odd component (resp. even component). Let  denote the number of odd components of G. The notation 
 with  denotes that the graph 
 is isomorphic to the graph 
.

2.2. Two diagnostic models
The set of test (comparison) outcomes under the PMC model and MM⁎ model is referred to as the syndrome. We use the notation Ω to represent the syndrome of the multiprocessor system. Let  represent the set of test (comparison) outcomes produced by the faulty set F. Define two different faulty sets of , 
 and 
. If 
, 
 and 
 are called to be distinguishable, that is, 
 is a distinguishable pair; otherwise, 
 and 
 are called to be indistinguishable and 
 is an indistinguishable pair. The symmetric difference 
 between 
 and 
 is denoted by 
. The sufficient and necessary conditions of two faulty sets 
 and 
 being distinguishable under the PMC model and MM⁎ model were proposed by Dahbura and Masson [26] and Sengupta and Dahbura [12], respectively.

2.3. Introduction on 
First, we provide the definition of n-dimensional hypercube 
, which is the basic structure for constructing Bicube networks. The n-dimensional hypercube 
 is a graph consisting of 
 vertices labeled by n-bit string on 
. For two vertices 
 and 
, u is adjacent to v if and only if they exactly differ in jth-bit with , that is 
. Then we can denote its vertex set by 
 and its edge set by 
.

By interconnecting two isomorphic hypercubes, Lim et al. [24] proposed the Bicube with the diameter about half that of a comparable hypercube. The n-dimensional Bicube, denoted by 
, is the graph on the vertex set 
. For any vertex 
, we represent c by an n-bit string 
. For 
 with , let 
. Let 
 denote the complement of 
. The substring of 
 is defined as 
 with . Obviously, 
. Let  denote the parity of 1s in 
.

Based on the construction methodology of Bicube referred in [24], an intuitive definition of 
 was given by Liu et al. [27] as follows.

Definition 1

. For , let 
 and 
 be any two vertices in 
. c is adjacent to d if and only if they satisfy one of the following rules (see Fig. 2).

An n-dimensional Bicube 
 is an n-regular bipartite graph consisting of 
 vertices and 
 edges. 
 can be decomposed into two -dimensional hypercubes 
s, denoted by 
 and 
 respectively. We refer to the edges of rule (1) and rule (2) as cube edges and cross edges respectively. For any vertex in 
 with , it is associated with exactly one cross edge and has an external neighbor in 
. Obviously, there exists a perfect matching between 
 and 
. Fig. 2 shows the structures of

 and 
, where the edges of rule (1) are colored with black and the edges of rule (2) are colored with green and yellow.

In the following, we provide some basic lemmas used in this paper.

Proof

By Definition 1,

, denoted by 
 and 
 respectively. Let

 for . Then . We consider the following cases.

Case 1. .

Without loss of generality, we assume that 
 
, and thus 
. Since

, each vertex in 
 has an external neighbor in 
. Since less than h vertices are deleted from 
, at most  vertices in

. Hence, the lemma holds.

Case 2. .

In this case, we have that 
, 
 
. Let

Subcase 2.2. .

Without loss of generality, we assume that

 and small components containing at most  vertices. Then we have
 
 
 

Subcase 2.3. .

Since , both

Let

In the following, we will show that

Definition 2

[3] Let . If  is disconnected and consists of at least h components, then F is called an h-component vertex cut. The h-component connectivity of G is

Theorem 1

Proof

Let u be a vertex in 
. Arbitrarily select h neighbors of u and let L be a set of these neighbors. Without loss of generality, suppose that 
. By Definition 1, u has exactly one neighbor v in 
. Then we consider the following cases.

Case 1. .

In this case, 
. By Definition 1, each vertex in L has  neighbors in 
 via cube edges and exactly one neighbor in 
 via a cross edge. By Lemma 4, each pair of vertices in L shares exactly two common neighbors, one of them is u. Thus
 
 

Case 2. .

Since , only one vertex of L is located in 
 while other  vertices are located in 
. By Lemma 4, we can obtain that each vertex in  and v share exactly one common neighbor u, and each pair of vertices in  shares exactly two common neighbors, one of them is u. Thereby, we have
 
 

Since

.

Now, we prove that 
 
. Let R be the minimum -component vertex cut of 
, which leads to one large component and h singletons. Thus 
 consists of a large component and small components containing at least h vertices. By Corollary 1, we have that 
 
.

Thus, we can obtain that 
 
. □

4. The -component diagnosability of 
In this section, we will evaluate the -component diagnosability of 
. The concept of h-component diagnosability, showed as follows, was proposed by Zhang et al. [19].

Definition 3

[19] For a system G, if any two distinct h-component vertex cuts 
 and 
 with

, which is the maximum value of t such that G is h-component t-diagnosable.

Definition 4

[16]For a system G with at most t faulty vertices, given any test syndrome σ produced by the system, G is called -diagnosable if all faulty vertices can be isolated into a set of vertices 
 such that 
 consists of at most k misdiagnosed vertices (fault-free vertices), i.e., 
. The -diagnosability of G is defined as the maximum value of t such that the system G is -diagnosable.

Definition 5

Lemma 11

For  and , let F be a faulty vertex set of

. Obviously, C is the largest connected component 
 of 
. For , , note that

-DIAG-PMC is , where 
.

Proof

By the algorithm -
-DIAG-PMC, the main time cost is on Step 2 and Step 3. Step 2 runs at most 
 time. On Step 3, the BFS algorithm runs at most  time.

For , we have that  and 
 
. Therefore, both Step 2 and Step 3 cost  time. Step 4 and Step 5 cost  time. Step 6 costs  time. Hence, the total time of algorithm -
-DIAG-PMC is . □

-diagnosis with , . □

6. Conclusion
Fault tolerance and fault diagnosis are two most important aspects in evaluating the reliability of multiprocessor systems. The component connectivity is an important indicator of fault tolerance in the existence of failing processors. The component diagnosability and the -diagnosability are based on precise and imprecise diagnosis strategies respectively, which can apparently improve multiprocessor systems' self-diagnosing capability. In this paper, we have studied the combinatorial and fault tolerant properties of the n-dimensional Bicube 
. And then we analyzed the component reliability of 
, i.e., investigated the -component connectivity of 
 (, ) and the -component diagnosability of 
 under the PMC model and MM⁎ model (, ). Furthermore, based on imprecise diagnosis strategy, we proposed the -diagnosis algorithm of 
 under the PMC model and then derived the -diagnosability of 
 (, ).

Future works include exploring the relationship among the component connectivity, the component diagnosability and the -diagnosability of general regular networks. In addition, evaluating the indicators mentioned in this paper of other famous interconnection networks is also a topic worthy of attention, such as the exchanged generalized hypercube [32] and the divide-and-swap cube network [33].
