Abstract
The connectivity and its generalizations have been well studied due to their impact on the fault tolerance and diagnosability of the interconnection networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel generalized connectivity, which combines the h-extra connectivity and r-component connectivity. Given a connected graph , for any  and , an h-extra r-component cut of G is a subset  such that there are at least r components in  and each component has at least  vertices; h-extra r-component connectivity of G, denoted as 
, is the minimum size of any h-extra r-component cut of G. We determine the h-extra r-component connectivity of n-dimensional hypercube

1. Introduction
Fault tolerance is one of the major problems in the research of interconnection networks. Usually, an interconnection network can be modeled by a connected graph. Each processor in the network is represented by a vertex in the graph; and the communication link between any two processors is represented by an edge between two corresponding vertices. The reliability and fault tolerance of an interconnection network are closely related with the connectivity of a graph. Given a connected graph G, a subset of vertices is called a cut of G if its removal disconnects G. The minimum size of a cut of G is the connectivity of G, denoted as . In a large interconnection network, faults occur in the processors frequently, which may induce disconnection of the network. The connectivity is a lower bound of the number of faulty processors to disconnect the network. While the minimum vertex-degree of the graph is an upper bound of the connectivity. This turns out that the connectivity is restricted by the disconnections with some isolated vertex and a large connected component. In this case, the “core” of the network is still connected. So it is more reasonable to estimate the connectivity or faulty tolerance of the network more precisely.

There are several generalizations of the classical connectivity of graphs. Chartrand et al. in [1] and Sampathkumar in [2] introduced independently the r-component connectivity of a connected graph G, which is the minimum size of a subset of vertices, called an r-component cut of G if exists, whose removing results in at least r components, denoted as 
. The network is more disconnected in the sense that there are more components remained. Many researches have studied the r-component connectivity in kinds of networks for small r. For n-dimensional hypercube 
, Hsu et al. [3] and Zhao et al. [4] studied the cases for  and  respectively. In [5], [6], Cheng et al. studied the r-component connectivity of the n-dimensional hierarchical cubic and complete cubic networks for  respectively. Later, they gave the results of the generalized exchanged hypercubes in some special cases [7]. Chang et al. in [8], [9] worked on the alternating group networks for . There are also some works in the twisted cubes and dual cubes, please see [10], [11]. Recently, the Cayley graph generated by trees were explored in [12], [13]

Another popular generalization of connectivity of a connected graph G is proposed by Fàbrega and Fiol in [14], called the h-extra connectivity. It is the minimum size of a subset of vertices, called an h-extra cut of G if exists, whose removal disconnects G and each remaining component has at least  vertices, denoted as 
. There are many papers working on the h-extra connectivity in special networks, such as k-ary n-cube networks [15], BC networks [16], folded cubes [17], alternating group graphs [18], Split-Star networks [19], bubble-sort star graphs [20], balanced hypercubes [21], [22], data center network DCell [23], DQcubes [24], enhanced hypercubes [25] and so on. From the intuition of h-extra connectivity, h-extra diagnosability was proposed in [26]. Many researchers work on the h-extra diagnosability of special networks, such as hypercubes [26], [27], folded hypercubes [28], [29], bubble-sort star graph networks [30], locally twisted cubes [31], crossed cubes [32] and -star networks [33] etc. Moreover, the relations between the h-extra connectivity and h-extra diagnosability attracted much attention, please see [34], [35], [36], [37], [38].

In this paper, we combine the r-component connectivity and h-extra connectivity of a graph and propose a more general connectivity as follows:

Definition 1

Given a connected graph , for two integers  and , a subset  is called an h-extra r-component cut of G if there are at least r connected components in  and each component has at least  vertices. The minimum size of any h-extra r-component cut of G, if exists, is the h-extra r-component connectivity of G, denoted as 
.

From the definition, we get the following results immediately:

Lemma 1

Given a connected graph , for any integers  and , we have that:

;

•
;

•
.

The rest part of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, some definitions and notations are introduced. Also, some previous results are displayed, which is useful for proving the main theorem later. In Section 3, the 1-extra r-component connectivity of 
 for  is determined. An upper bound is displayed for . Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 4.

2. Preliminary
Hypercubes are fundamental models for interconnection networks. The n-dimensional hypercube 
 is an undirected graph, in which each vertex can be represented by an n-bit binary () string and every two vertices are adjacent if and only if their corresponding strings differ in exactly one dimension. Note that 
 is a bipartite graph with one part containing exactly all vertices whose corresponding strings have odd number of 1s.

Notations: For any graph  and a vertex , the set of all neighbors of v is denoted as 
; and for any , 
 is called the set of all neighbors of S. The subgraph induced by S is denoted as . Following Latifi in [39], we always express 
 as 
 where 
 and 
 are two -dimensional hypercubes of 
 induced by the vertices with the ith coordinates 0 and 1 respectively. Then there is a perfect matching between 
 and 
. The two ends of each matching edge differ exactly in the ith dimension.

First, let us justify the range of r, i.e. the maximum number of components, in 
 for any cut S.

Lemma 2

For , let S be a cut of 
 such that there are exactly  connected components in 
. Then it satisfies that

 can be attained when S is an independent set containing exactly 
 vertices and all the r components in 
 are trivial, i.e. they are all isolated vertices.

Proof

This is true for . We prove the lemma by induction on n. Suppose that the lemma is true for

Denote 
 and 
. Assume that there are exactly 
 (resp. 
) connected components in 
 (resp. 
). Then 
 (resp. 
). So

2.
Since 
 is a bipartite graph, let X and Y be its two parts. Then 
. Let 
 and 
, where  (resp. ) is a -bit string. Then 
 can be decomposed as in Fig. 1. Let 
. Then S is an independent set containing exactly 
 vertices and all the r components in 
 are trivial. □

Given an h-extra cut S of 
 for , from this lemma one sees that there are less than 
 components in 
. But for  and , there exists an 1-extra 
-component cut 
 of 
. In 
, there are exactly 
 components and each component contains exactly two adjacent vertices. The construction of 
 can be done recursively: for , let  where  and . Then 
 is an 1-extra 2-component cut of 
 and the two components in 
 are the two subgraphs induced by  and  respectively. Symmetrically, one sees that C is also an 1-extra 2-component cut of 
 satisfying the required properties. It means that there are at least two choices, C or 
, of 
 and one sees that 
. For , let 
 be an 1-extra 
-component cut of 
 and 
 be an 1-extra 
-component cut of 
. Note that there is no edge between 
 and 
 in 
. Then 
 and 
 are two 1-extra 
-component cuts of 
 satisfying the required properties respectively. Please see an example for  in Fig. 2. This shows that 1-extra r-component cut is well defined for any 
.

At the end of this section, we display some lemmas, which play an important role in the proof of our main results.

Lemma 3

Lemma 7

For , 
 
 for  and 
 
 for . In particular, 
 for .

For , before showing the main result, we prove that any two independent edges in 
 have at least  neighbors.

Lemma 8

For , let 
 and 
. Then 
.

Proof

There are no odd cycles in 
 since 
 is a bipartite graph. So 
 (resp. 
) have no common neighbors in 
; And 
 (resp. 
) cannot have common neighbors with both 
 and 
 otherwise there will exist a cycle of length 5 in 
. So at most 2 pairs of the 4 vertices can have common neighbors and the number is at most 4 since any pair of vertices in 
 can have at most 2 common neighbors. 
⁎ since in the induced subgraph of 
, there are exactly 2 edges. □

Theorem 1

 for .

Proof

Let ,  and , . Let 
. Then . There are at least three components in 
, two of which are 
 and 
, because 
 for . One sees that F does not contain the neighborhood of any vertex w in 
 since 
 by its bipartite property and that 
 contains at least three components. There are exactly one edge in these two components respectively. Moreover, there is no isolated vertex in 
 since the neighborhood of any vertex is not contained in F. So 
 for .

Next, we prove that 
 for . Suppose that S is an 1-extra 3-component cut of 
 and . Let 
 be the connected components in 
, where  and 
.

Denote 
 and 
. Then 
 and 
. W. l. o. g, let 
. Then 
. From Lemma 3, we consider the following two cases:

•
Case 1) 
 is connected. Then 
 is disconnected with at least l components, two of which are 
 and 
. See in Fig. 3. So 
. Note that 
 and 
. So 
. Let 
. Then . From Lemma 4, 
 for  and 
 for , where 
 and 
 are both quadratic functions with t. So the minimum value of 
 for  and 
 for  is 
 for  by some simple computations; and the minimum value attains only when . So 
 for  and the equality holds only when 
. In this case 
 and 
 are both components with exactly one edge respectively. Let 
 (resp. 
) be the unique edge in 
 (resp. 
). Then 
 have no common neighbor, because there is no triangle in 
. So 
. Similarly, 
. If 
 and 
 have a common neighbor, then 
 and 
 have no common neighbors since otherwise there is a cycle of length 5 in 
, contradiction with its bipartiteness. Let u be a common neighbor of 
 and 
 if exists. Then the corresponding strings of u and 
 (resp. 
) differ in exactly one dimension. So 
 and 
 differs in exactly two dimensions. So they have two common neighbors. In this case, one sees similarly that 
 and 
 have at most two common neighbors in total. So 
. This implies that 
. So . It is a contradiction.

 is connected. All neighbors of C1 and C2 are contained in S = S0 ∪ S1. So all their neighbors in 
 are contained in S0. So |V(C1)| + |V(C2)| ≤ |S0|.

•
Case 2) 
 is disconnected with exactly two connected components, one of which is an isolated vertex, denoted as 
. Let 
 be the other component not containing 
. In this case, 
. Let 
 be the unique neighbor of 
 in 
. Then 
 and 
 and 
 are in the same connected component of 
.

If 
 is connected, then there are at most two connected components in 
. It is a contradiction. So 
 is disconnected. Suppose there are j (≥2) connected components in 
.

–
If there exist two components in 
 which are also components of 
, then the theorem can be proved as in case 1.

–
At most one component in 
 is also a component of 
. Since 
 has at least 3 components and 
 and 
 can be in at most 2 components. So there are exactly 3 components in 
. One containing 
, one containing 
 and another one is also a component of 
. We use 
 to denote the component containing 
 and 
 to denote the component not containing 
 and 
. Then 
. So 
. Since S is a 1-extra 3-component cut, 
 both have at least 2 vertices. So 
. Similar calculation as in case 1) can get that 
 for ; and the minimum value attains only when . So  and the equality attains only when 
 and 
. But by Lemma 8 this implies . It is a contradiction. □

Before we prove the result for , let us prove an upper bound of 
 for .

Theorem 2

Proof

To prove the theorem, it is sufficient to find an 1-extra r-component cut of 
 with size at most . Let 
 be the vertex with only the ith coordinate 1 for . Let 
 be the vertex with only two coordinates the ith and the nth 1s for . Then 
. For any  and , 
 and 
 have exactly two different coordinates, the ith and the jth, so they have exactly two common neighbors,  and the vertex with the ith and the jth coordinates 1s, all others 0s; similarly, 
 and 
 have exactly two common neighbors,  and the one with the th coordinates 1s, all others 0s for any  and . Let 
. Then 
 and S does not contain the neighborhood of any vertex in 
 for 
 
. One sees that S is an 1-extra r-component cut of 
, with components 
 for  and components in 
, which contains no isolated vertex and is not empty from simple counts. This proves the theorem. □

Finally, in the following theorem, we prove that the upper bound in Theorem 2 is attained for .

Theorem 3

 for .

Proof

From Theorem 2, it is sufficient to prove that 
. Suppose that S is an 1-extra 4-component cut of 
 and . Let 
 be the connected components in 
, where  and 
. Denote 
 and 
. Then 
 and 
. W. l. o. g, let 
. Then 
. From Lemma 5, we consider the following four cases:

•

 and 
. So 
. Note that the neighborhood of any one of 
 and 
 is disjoint with the other two components. So 
. Let 
 and . Then . For , from Lemma 4, Lemma 6, 
 for  and 
 for ; and for , 
 since 
. The minimum value of 
 for  and 
 for  is 
 for  by some simple computations; and the minimum value attains only when . Moreover, 
 for  and  from similar calculations. Then  since 
. In this case 
 and 
 are all components with exactly one edge respectively. As proved in Lemma 8, one can prove similarly that any three independent edges have at least  neighbors. This implies that 
. It is a contradiction.

•
 is disconnected with exactly two connected components, one of which contains exactly one vertex, denoted as 
. Then there are at least three components 
 in 
 such that 
. So 
. Moreover, the three components including 
 separately in the subgraph induced by vertices in 
 are also three components in 
. Then from the same discussion as the first case one gets the contradiction.

•
 is disconnected with exactly three connected components, two of which are isolated vertices, denoted as 
 and 
. Then there are at least three components 
 in 
 such that 
. So 
. Moreover, the three components including 
 separately in the subgraph induced by vertices in 
 are also three components in 
. Then from the same discussion as the first case one gets the contradiction.

•

–
If 
 is also a component, denoted as C, in 
, then there are at least two components 
 in 
, which are also two components in 
. So 
. Then there are three components 
 in 
 with at most  vertices. From the same discussion as the first case one gets the contradiction.

–
Otherwise

. Then there are at least three components 
 in 
 such that 
. We arrive the same situation as the third case above.

The theorem is proved. □
