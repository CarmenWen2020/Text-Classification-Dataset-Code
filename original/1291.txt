Abstract
Rotation symmetric Boolean functions are potentially rich in functions of cryptographic significance. In this paper, a new construction of odd-variable rotation symmetric Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity is presented. By a direct calculation, the nonlinearity of the newly constructed functions is higher than the nonlinearities of all the known odd-variable rotation symmetric Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity. The algebraic degree and the fast algebraic immunity of our functions are also considered.

1. Introduction
Boolean functions used in cryptographic systems should satisfy a variety of cryptographic properties to resist many attacks. These are balancedness, optimal algebraic immunity, high nonlinearity, high algebraic degree, and good immunity to fast algebraic attacks. Algebraic attack was proposed by Courtois and Meier in 2003 [6]. Since then, several classes of Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity have been investigated and constructed (see [2], [3], [7] and the references therein). Boolean functions in cryptography should be kept away from affine functions as far as possible, that is, they should have high nonlinearity. The nonlinearity is strongly related to the resistance of affine approximation attack [8] and fast correlation attack [1].

A Boolean function is said to be rotation symmetric if it is invariant under the action of cyclic group. As we know, a variety of rotation symmetric Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity have been proposed [5], [9], [10], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. Very recently, in 2019, there were three new works about constructing n-variable rotation symmetric Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity, where n is an odd integer. Firstly, Zhao et al. constructed a class of n-variable rotation symmetric Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity and nonlinearity 
 
 
 
 
 [18]. Secondly, Zhang et al. constructed a class of n-variable rotation symmetric Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity and nonlinearity 
 
 
 
 
 [17]. Thirdly, the authors in paper [4] constructed a class of rotation symmetric Boolean functions on odd variables with optimal algebraic immunity and higher nonlinearity, whose nonlinearity can not be simply expressed.

In this paper, we present a new construction of odd-variable rotation symmetric Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity by modifying the support of the majority function. The nonlinearity of the newly constructed functions is higher than the nonlinearities of all the known odd-variable rotation symmetric Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity. In addition, the algebraic degree and the fast algebraic immunity of these functions on n variables are also analyzed for small values of n.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Some basic definitions and necessary preliminaries are reviewed in Section 2. In Section 3, the construction of odd-variable rotation symmetric Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity is presented. At the same time, the nonlinearity, the algebraic degree, and the fast algebraic immunity of the newly constructed rotation symmetric Boolean functions are also discussed. Section 4 concludes this paper.

2. Preliminaries
Let 
 be the n-dimensional vector space over the finite field 
. Given a vector 
, define its support as the set 
, and its Hamming weight  as the cardinality of its support, i.e., . Given two vectors 
 and 
, if 
 for all , then α is said to be covered by β, denoted by .

An n-variable Boolean function f is a mapping from 
 into 
. We denote by 
 the set of all n-variable Boolean functions. The basic representation of an n-variable Boolean function f is by the output of its truth table, i.e., a binary string of length 
 as follows

For a Boolean function 
, its support is defined as 
. The Hamming weight of the Boolean function f is the cardinality of its support, i.e., . We say that a Boolean function f on n variables is balanced if 
. The Hamming distance between two n-variable Boolean functions f and g is the Hamming weight of , i.e., . In cryptography, the algebraic normal form (ANF) of any n-variable Boolean function f is defined as(1) 
 
 where 
, 
 for 
 and 
. The algebraic degree of the Boolean function f in (1) is defined as

Algebraic attack has received a lot of attention recently in studying the security of Stream ciphers as well as Block ciphers. One necessary condition to resist this attack is that the Boolean function used in the cipher should have a good algebraic immunity.

Definition 1

The algebraic immunity of a Boolean function  on n variables, denoted by , is defined as

In fact, the algebraic immunity of an n-variable Boolean function f satisfies 
 
 [6]. If 
 
, then f is said to have an optimal algebraic immunity.

The Walsh transform of an n-variable Boolean function f at the point 
 is defined as(2)
 
 where 
 for 
 and 
. Walsh transform is an important tool to study the cryptographic properties of Boolean functions. It is known that an n-variable Boolean function f is balanced if and only if 
, where 
. Furthermore, the nonlinearity of an n-variable Boolean function f, which is the minimum Hamming distance between f and all the affine functions on n variables, denoted by , can be expressed by Walsh transform in (2) as(3)
 
 

The n-variable majority function  is defined as 
 
  It was first proposed by Ding et al. [8]. In paper [7], Dalai et al. showed that the majority function  achieves the optimal algebraic immunity. However, the nonlinearity of the function  is 
 
 , which is almost the worst possible value according to Lobanov's bound [11].

For a vector 
 and an integer , define
 where 
 for . In other words, 
 acts as l-cyclic rotation on an n-bit vector. An orbit generated by a vector 
 is defined as

Definition 2

For a Boolean function 
, if 
 holds for all 
 and , then f is called a rotation symmetric Boolean function (RSBF).

At the end of this section, we introduce a result on the enumeration of ordered composition (partition) of a positive integer k, which is a basis of our construction of rotation symmetric Boolean functions. The composition of a positive integer k is a sequence 
 with 
, where 
 for  and the order is considered. Each 
 is called a part of the composition. The number of the distinct compositions of k is denoted by . By convention, take .

Denote the number of all the different compositions of an integer k with exactly i parts by 
. Then, we have the following famous conclusion.

Lemma 1

[15]
The number of distinct compositions of a positive integer k into i parts is
  where .

Since

3.4. The algebraic degree of  in (11)
In this subsection, we calculate the algebraic degree of the RSBF  in (11). Firstly, we recall the algebraic degree of the majority function F.

. Generally, the fast algebraic immunity, resistance to fast algebraic attacks, of the function  is defined as Nevertheless, the fast algebraic immunity of a Boolean function is very hard to be determined. So, we must rely on computer simulations only for relatively small values of n.

For , some cryptographic properties of the n-variable function  in (11) are listed as follows.

(1)
If , the subsets T defined in (6) and U defined in (9) are Hence, the algebraic degree of  is 12 and the fast algebraic immunity of  is 10.

(2)

4. Conclusion
In this paper, we present a new construction of odd-variable RSBFs with optimal algebraic immunity, whose cryptographic properties such as algebraic immunity, nonlinearity, algebraic degree, and fast algebraic immunity are studied. The nonlinearity of the newly constructed RSBFs is higher than the nonlinearities of all the known odd-variable RSBFs with optimal algebraic immunity, and the algebraic degree is also high enough. How to construct RSBFs with better cryptographic properties is our future work.
