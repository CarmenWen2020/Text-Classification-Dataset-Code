Abstract
The attackers may have a tendency of targeting on a vulnerable network due to the fact that the cost of this attack is lower and the probability of successful attack is higher. Therefore, in order to enhance the invulnerability of a network, designers of massively networked multiprocessor systems concentrate on the robustness and reliability of the network. Connectivity and diagnosability are two significant indicators to measure the anti-attack ability of a network. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of topological structure based on group theory, the n-dimensional cactus-based network, denoted by CNn. Then we show the characterization of algebraic and combinatorial properties for the cactus network as well as its connectivity, super connectivity, extra connectivity and corresponding diagnosabilities.

1. Introduction
The attackers tend to attack a weak network since the cost of this attack is lower and the probability of successful attack is higher, and so they hope to avoid the existence of significant large communication groups in the remaining network. However, from the perspective of defenders, they hope that network designers can design the robust networks to resist the malicious attacks of attackers. Connectivity and diagnosability are two significant indicators to measure the robustness and anti-attack ability of a network.

Large scale multiprocessor systems or multi-computer systems, taking interconnection networks as underlying topologies, have been widely applied in the big data era. In multiprocessor systems, several processors are connected by the interconnecting architecture that supports inter-processor data exchange [11], [40], in particular, in applications related to supercomputers, such as Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer [47] and Tianhe-2 supercomputer [32]. The anti-attack and fault diagnosability of large-scale network is a hot topic in the field of theoretical computer science. However, it is inevitable for attackers to destroy some servers. It may reduce communication of information, even lead to paralysis the system, thus affecting the normal operation of multiprocessor system, and bring huge loss to our life and economy. On Google and Amazon systems, for example, the failure of processors for several hours can bring millions of dollars of losses. To maintain the security and availability of the network, a common and effective solution becomes increasingly important for analysing network robustness. Connectivity, as a powerful tool, has been widely deployed. In addition, system-level fault diagnosis is an essential technology for the construction and maintenance of the system. When the system breaks down, system-level fault diagnosis is a powerful diagnostic tool for the multiprocessor system to diagnose the faulty processors as quickly as possible. Currently, system-level fault diagnosis protocols have been applied for mobile ad hoc networks [20], wireless sensor networks [45], data center networks [22] and social networks [25].

In recent decades, quite a lot excellent network topologies involving algebraic method have been designed by researchers. The hypercube is one of the most popular interconnection networks, which are favored by considerable scholars. Akers et al. [1] proposed a class of popular parallel architectures, the star network, written as 
, a more attractive alternative compared to the n-cube. However, the number of vertices of star network form a bottleneck for using them as models for interconnection networks. Two popular remedies were proposed to address this issue, -star network 
 [8] and arrangement graph network 
 [10]. Cheng et al. [5] have successively evolved a new network 
 by providing a common generalization of all these two classes of networks. Gates (the founder of Microsoft, William Henry Gates) and Papadimitriou [14] designed a family of Cayley graphs, the burnt pancake networks 
, which originates from the burnt pancake problem that relates to the construction of networks of parallel processors; and investigated the upper and lower bound for the diameter of an n-dimensional pancake network (this may be the first academic paper of Gates during the Harvard University). Song et al. [35] showed that the burnt pancake network is Cayley graph based on the wreath product of the cyclic group 
 and symmetric group 
. Akers and Krishnamurthy [1] proposed the bubble sort network, denoted by 
 in this work. Chou et al. [9] proposed a new interconnection network, the bubble star network, written as 
, which is the hybrid structure of the bubble sort network and the star network, combining the advantages of both networks and overcoming their individual flaws. Recently, Guo and Lu [17], [18] investigated the extra connectivity and edge-bipancyclicity of the bubble star network; Gu and Hao et al. [16] established the component connectivity of bubble-sort star graphs and burnt pancake graphs, which is a significant issue on the research topic of networks. Tu et al. [36] developed a family of interesting Cayley graph, the transposition wheel network, written as 
, whose generator is a wheel graph. Specifically, Feng and Wang [13] established the {Path, Cycle}-based structure and substructure connectivity of the wheel network 
. Recently, Xu et al. [42] presented a class of Cayley graphs generated by 2-trees 
, the 2-tree transposition network 
, and explored its -good-neighbor connectivity.

Inspired by the constructions above, in this paper, we design a class of novel network on  vertices, the n-dimensional cactus-based network 
, one class of Cayley graphs generated by transpositions. In addition, we establish the connectivity, super connectivity, extra connectivity and their corresponding diagnosabilities of the cactus-based network. Finally, we give some comparison and discussion for fault tolerance and reliability of the cactus-based network.

The remainder of this work is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces terminologies and notations, and presents the cactus-based network together with its algebraic and combinatorial properties. Section 3 is devoted to the connectivity and diagnosability of 
. Section 4 explores the super connectivity, extra connectivity and their corresponding diagnosabilities of 
. Finally, conclusions and future directions of research are discussed in the final section.

2. Preliminaries
2.1. Terminologies and notions
A large scale multiprocessor system is normally modeled by an interconnection network, which is composed of a set of processors, each with its own local memories, and communication links for data transmission between processors. More specifically, topologies proposed to interconnect the nodes in the multiprocessor system have been modeled as graphs, in which the vertices (or nodes) correspond to processors or routers and the edges (or links) represent communication channels.

Let  be a simple and finite graph, where  and  represent the vertex set and edge set of G, respectively. For any vertex , we denote 
 as the neighborhood of u in G. Moreover, for a simple graph G, the degree of a vertex u is represented by 
. For a vertex set S of a graph G, we use 
 to denote the open neighbor set of S, i.e., 
, and , the closed neighbor set. When the graph G is clear from the context, we use  to replace 
,  to replace 
. We use  to represent an edge between x and y, sometimes abbreviated as xy in the context. Given two sets , we use  to denote the cross edge set between A and B. A subgraph induced by X in G is denoted by . For any two vertices , we denoted  the number of common neighbors they share, i.e., . A path in a graph is a sequence of distinct vertices so that there is an edge joining consecutive vertices, with the length being the number of edges. A cycle is a path of length at least 3 such that there is an edge joining the first and last vertices. If a cycle has length k, we call it a k-cycle, written as 
. We use 
 to represent the shortest path length from x to y in G, and denote  refers to the diameter of G, i.e., 
. The girth of G, written as , refers to the smallest cycle of G.

The connectivity of a network G, denoted by , is the minimum cardinality of a set of vertices, whose deletion disconnects G. If , we call G k-connected. Furthermore, a k-regular network is super-connected if its only minimum vertex-cut set can isolate a single vertex; that is, a minimum vertex-cut set consists of all neighbors of a single vertex. In addition, F is called a super vertex cut of G if  is disconnected and each component contains no isolated vertex. The super connectivity of G, written as 
, is the minimum cardinality of all super vertex-cuts of G.

For further terminologies and notions on graphs and networks which are not presented here, we refer the reader to the monographs [41], [48].

2.2. Topological structure of 
In recent years, various kinds of interconnected networks have been widely studied. Different interconnected networks share different properties in terms of diameter, connectivity, vertex-symmetric, routing and broadcast programs, etc. In order to better balance network's performance and cost, many desirable topological structures have been proposed. Transposition networks have been extensively applied in current interconnected networks. In this work, we construct a class of new interconnection networks, the cactus-based networks, which is a class of Cayley graphs generated from a transposition graph 
 (see Fig. 2). In the following, we first give the definitions of the construction of Cayley graphs.

Definition 1

[29] Let H be a finite group, and S be a generating set of H. The right Cayley graph  of H corresponding to S is defined as: its vertex set is H, its edge set is . If for each , we have 
, then the Cayley graph is undirected; and  has no loop if S does not contain the identity of H.

Suppose that every element of S is a transposition. Then the permutation group generated by S is a subgroup of the symmetric group 
. The transposition set S could be illustrated by a simple graph. Let S be a simple connected graph with vertex set  and . So the edge set  corresponds to a transposition set S in 
. In this sense, H is called a transposition simple graph, where every edge of S can be considered as a transposition in 
. The Cayley graph  is called the corresponding Cayley graph of S. Even now, many significant networks have been constructed based on group theory. Accordingly, we make a summary on Cayley graphs based on some transposition generating graphs (see Table 1).

Let 
 be a graph obtained from a star of order  by adding a new edge between the th vertex and th vertex except for the central vertex of the star . We call 
 the cactus graph. Fig. 2 shows the representation of 
. For the corresponding Cayley graph of 
, we call the cactus-based network, written as 
.

The n-dimensional cactus-based network is an interesting interconnected network topology. Here, we represent the vertex set of 
 by -bit strings, for example, 
 where 
, and 
 is said to be the ith bit. For convenience, let  denote the set  and  throughout the context.

In the following, the detailed definition of 
 is elaborated as follows.

Definition 2

The n-dimensional cactus-based network 
 has the vertex set that consists of all  permutations on . A permutation u on  is denoted as 
. A vertex 
 is adjacent to a vertex 
 if and only if one of the followings holds.

•
(Rule 1) there exists an integer  such that 
, 
 and 
 for every , i.e., exchange the 1st digit with the ith digit.

•
(Rule 2) there exists an integer  such that 
, 
 and 
 for every , i.e., swapping the th digit and th digit, where .

It follows from the definition above that 
 is 3n-regular with 2n edges generated by Rule (1) and n edges generated by Rule (2). Therefore, it implies that 
 contains 
 
 edges.

Next, we describe the hierarchical structure of cactus-based network 
. Each 
 is composed of  identical copies (or clusters) 
 by fixing the two rightmost coordinates, written as 
, 
, sometimes, abbreviated as 
. In this paper, we will use them interchangeably. Clearly, 
 is isomorphic to 
 for any positive integer . Therefore, the cactus-based network 
 preserves the nice hierarchy. In what follows, we use 
 to denote the number of cross edges with one end-vertex in 
 and another one in 
 for . For any vertex u in 
, the external neighbors of u refer to the adjacent vertices which are not in the 
. Further properties of the cactus-based network 
 are elaborated as follows.

Proposition 1

 possesses the combinational properties as below.

(1) 
 has  vertices, 
 
 edges as well as regular degree 3n.

(2) The n-dimensional cactus-based network is bipartite.

(3) The girth of 
 is 4, i.e., .

Proof

(1) Obviously, Proposition 1(1) holds for 
.

(3) As 
 is bipartite by Proposition 1(2), it has no triangles. Thus, 
. In addition, there exists one 4-cycle in 
, i.e.,
 Therefore, the girth of 
 is 4, as desired. □

Proposition 2

 has the following structural properties.

(1) Each vertex in 
 has exactly three external neighbors which lie in distinct copies.

(2) For any copy 
, external neighbors of all neighbors of any vertex in 
 are distributed in  distinct copies.

(3) For two distinct positive integers , 
 
.

Proof

(1) Let 
 be any vertex of the cluster 
 with . The external neighbors of u are
 Observe that two rightmost coordinates of any two of three external neighbors are not the same, so these three vertices belong to three distinct copies. As a result, the assertion (1) follows as desired.

(2) For any vertex 
 in 
, all neighbors of u are listed as follows.
  Taking Definition 2 together with Proposition 2(1), all external neighbors of 

 are distributed in 4n distinct clusters. Additionally, external neighbors of 
, …, 
 are only distributed in 4 distinct clusters. Consequently, external neighbors of all neighbors of any vertex are only distributed in  distinct clusters. So the assertion (2) is proved.

(3) By Proposition 2(1), every vertex in 
 has exactly three external neighbors which belong to distinct copies, respectively. Since each copy has  vertices, there are totally  edges from 
 to other  copies. Thus, by the regularity of 
, we obtain 
 
. □

To discuss conveniently, we use  to represent swapping the 1st digit with the ith digit of a permutation, and fixing other coordinates. In particular,  refers to swapping the 2ith digit with the th digit. Define 
 where  and 
 where .

Proposition 3

The n-dimensional cactus-based network 
 is a class of Cayley graph and so is vertex transitive.

Proof

It suffices to show that 
, where H is a finite permutation group on . Let 
 be the generating set of 
. The edges  of Cayley graph  have two forms. For any vertex , the edge 
 satisfies
  Therefore, it is easily checked that 
 is a bijection with edge preserving property, and 
 is isomorphic to the Cayley graph of group H corresponding to S, that is, 
. Thus, the n-dimensional cactus-based network 
 is vertex transitive, as desired. □

Regarding common neighbors of any two vertices u and v in 
, we have the following proposition.

Proposition 4

Let u and v be any two vertices in 
. Then
  where .

Proof

Set a vertex 
 in 
. Regarding the number of common neighbors of vertices u and v, we need to consider the situations as below.

Case 1:  for any two vertices u and v in 
.

When , uv is an edge. In this situation, since 
 has no triangle, we have .

When , one can check that there exists no common neighbor between u and v, i.e., .

Case 2:  for any two vertices u and v in 
.

If 
, by Definition 2, we notice that 
, 
 and 
 are three common neighbors of u and v; If 
, it follows from Definition 2 that 
, 
 and 
 are also three common neighbors of u and v; Therefore, when  and 
, we obtain .

If 
, by means of Definition 2, it is observed that 
 and 
 are two common neighbors of u and v, i.e., .

For other cases when , we always obtain , as desired.

This ends the proof of Proposition 3. □

3. The connectivity of cactus-based network 
In the process of designing symmetric interconnection networks, the overall objective has been to construct the large vertex symmetric networks with small diameter, high connectivity, good hierarchical structure and low latency. High connectivity among all these attributes is the most suitable one for network robustness to resist whole vulnerability attacks. In order to evaluate the robustness of the cactus-based network, in this section, we will explore the connectivity of 
.

We first define
 

Theorem 1

For the cactus-based network 
, 
 for .

Proof

We first establish the upper bound of 
. By means of Whitney inequality, we have
 as desired.

Now, it suffices to verify the lower bound of 
. Equally, we need to prove that 
 is still connected for any subset 
 with . We decompose 
 into  identical copies 
 as before, marked as 
, such that  and K are defined as above. As there exists at least one cross edge between any two modules in 
, 
 is connected. By the definition of 
, we have  (otherwise, if , then 
, which is a contradiction for ). Therefore, two possibilities with the restriction that  need to be explored (Fig. 5).

Case 1: , say .

For any vertex 
 , there exist three external neighbors, which are separately located in three distinct modules. Since 
 for , we have . Thus, the vertex u has at least one external neighbor connecting to 
. By the arbitrariness of u, it follows that 
 is connected to 
, i.e., 
 is connected to 
.

In addition, for any vertex 
 , the vertex w has exactly three external neighbors, which are separately located in three distinct modules. In view of  and , then . Thus, the vertex w has at least one external neighbor connecting to 
. By the arbitrariness of w, 
 is connected to 
, i.e., 
 is connected to 
.

As a result, 
 is connected, as desired.

Case 2: .

Because of , we have 
 for any . In view of 
 
 for  and , 
 is connected to 
, i.e., 
 is connected to 
. By the arbitrariness of j , 
 is connected to 
. Thus, 
 is connected.

Summing up above, we have 
. □

Remark 1

Theorem 1 also follows from a result in [3] in the study of a more general class of graphs. However, we provide a complete proof here so that the paper is self-contained, and it will also introduce ideas that are needed for the proofs of subsequent results. When we decompose the proposed network into genetic subgraphs, we should fix two successive positions, while the general construction in [3] focuses on fixing one position.

In light of the possible applications of the presented connectivity metric, we also point out the crucial role of system-level fault diagnosis in the reliability and robustness of networks. For a multi-processor system, the process of recognizing faulty processors is called system-level fault diagnosis. In fault diagnosis, the first diagnostic model is the PMC model [33], which is based on graph modeling and has been widely applied. The diagnosability of a multiprocessor system, denoted by , is the maximum number of faulty vertices that the system is guaranteed to identify [34]. Numerous studies of diagnosability for multiprocessor system networks have been explored under the PMC model by many scholars, see [2], [6], [7], [15], [21], [29], [27]. It is worth noting that Chang et al. [2] investigated the diagnosabilities of general multiprocessor systems under the PMC diagnostic model.

Definition 3

[2] A system G is said to be t-diagnosable if all faulty processors can be identified without replacing the faulty processors, provided that the number of faulty processors presented does not exceed t. The diagnosability  of G is the maximum value of t such that G is t-diagnosable.

Note that if all neighbors of a processor in the system are faulty simultaneously, then the processor cannot be tested as fault-free or faulty. Thus, . The following lemma suggests a relationship between connectivity and diagnosability of a network under the PMC model.

Lemma 1

[19] Let  be a multiprocessor system. The sufficient conditions for the system to be t-diagnosable under the PMC model are:

(1) ;

(2) .

Theorem 2

The diagnosability of 
 is 3n  under the PMC model.

Proof

By Theorem 1, 
. Since 
⁎ for , the diagnosability of 
 is 3n under the PMC model by Lemma 1. □

4. Super connectivity and extra connectivity of cactus-based network 
In the previous section, we have addressed the connectivity of the cactus-based network 
. However, to resist the assault of attackers, the classical connectivity does not well reflect the security and robustness for a network in the case of processor failures. Therefore, in this section, we will proceed further exploring the super connectivity and extra connectivity of 
.

Definition 4

[31] A set F is called a super vertex cut of G if  is disconnected and each component contains no isolated vertex. The super connectivity of G, written as 
, is the minimum cardinality over all super vertex-cuts of G.

Definition 5

[17] A set F is called a g-extra vertex cut of G if  is disconnected and each component of  has at least  vertices. The g-extra connectivity of G, written as 
, is the minimum cardinality over all g-extra vertex-cuts of G.

Many interesting and excellent results concerning the super connectivity and extra connectivity have been explored [12], [17], [28], [24], [26], [27], [30], [31], [39], [43], [44]. Here, we first establish the super connectivity of 
.

Theorem 3

For the cactus-based network 
, 
 for .

Proof

Since 
 has no triangle, we have 
, and
 Thus, 
 is a vertex-cut of 
.

By Proposition 1, all elements of 
 are distributed in five distinct clusters, i.e., 
. By checking, we have
 and
 Because of 
 
 for any four distinct integers , 
 is connected to 
, and so 
 is connected.

Since 
 as well as 
 
 for , 
 is connected to 
. Thus, 
 is connected. Therefore, 
 has two components, which are an isolated edge xy and a large component 
, respectively. Because of 
 
 for , 
 contains no isolated vertex. Hence, 
 is a super vertex-cut. As a result, 
 for , as desired.

Now, we start to explore the lower bound on 
, which is derived by a contradiction method. Assume, to the contrary, that 
. Let F be a super vertex-cut with the minimum size . As we mentioned earlier, let 
. Obviously,  (otherwise, 
 for , a contradiction). For any , 
, 
 is still connected because of 
 and 
. Applying Proposition 1(3), we have
 
 for any  where . Thus, 
 is connected to 
, which implies that 
 is connected.

Let W be the union of all small components of 
 which contains no vertices of 
. In the next, we will prove that . Suppose, to the contrary, that . Assume that 
 subject to 
. In this case, we have 
. For any edge xy of 
, 
. As a consequence, we obtain
 Observe that each vertex in W has exactly three external neighbors, 
. And so,
 Clearly,  which contradicts to . Hence, we have , which implies that F is not a super vertex-cut of 
, a contradiction. As a result, 
 is expected. □

Remark 2

Cheng and Lipták [3] studied a more general class of graphs under a different metric, and as a result, one can obtain immediately that the super connectivity of 
 is at least . One may think that since we are deleting one more vertex, we can leverage such a result and give a significantly shorter proof. However, we see no easy way to do it.

In what follows, we are devoted to resolving the -extra connectivity of the cactus network 
. According to the definition of super connectivity, it is implied that, if F is a super vertex-cut of G, then each component in  contains at least two vertices. Hence, the super connectivity of a network equals to its 1-extra connectivity in some sense. Thus, we determine the 1-extra connectivity of 
 directly.

Case 1:

 are distributed in the same module.

Without loss of generality, let 
 for some . By Proposition 4, the number of common neighbors of any two vertices in 
 is at most three. Thus, 
. By Proposition 1,

Case 2: 
 and 
 are distributed in two distinct modules.

Without loss of generality, let 
, and 
. By Proposition 4, 
 and 
. By Proposition 1, at most one external neighbor of

) is in 
. As a result, we have

Case 3: 
 and 
 are distributed in three distinct modules.

Without loss of generality, let 
, and 
. By the regularity of

 for any . By Proposition 4,

From the discussion above, we have

 refers to swapping the 2ith digit with the th digit for . Without loss of generality, let 
 for . By Proposition 1(2), 
 has no triangle. Thus, 
 and 
 (resp., 
 and 
) share no common neighbor. Applying Proposition 4, 
 and 
 share exactly three neighbors, one of which is 
. It follows that 
. By Proposition 2, 
 have distinct external neighbors. As a result, we have

In view of
 for , 
 is disconnected and  is a vertex-cut. Since each vertex in 
 has exactly three external neighbors and

 is connected for any . By Proposition 2(3),

, such that 
 (see Fig. 7). Thus, u is connected to 
. It follows that 
 is connected to 
 by the arbitrariness of u. Consequently, 
 has exactly two components, one of which is a 2-path and the other is a large component 
. This means that  is a 2-extra vertex-cut of 
. Hence, we have

Next, it suffices to show that 
 by a contradiction method. Assume that F is a 2-extra vertex-cut with minimum cardinality of 
. Suppose, to the contrary, that . As we defined earlier, let 
. Obviously,  (otherwise, 
, a contradiction for ). For any ,

 is still connected because of 
 and 
. Applying Proposition 1(3), we have
 
 for any  where . Thus, 
 is connected to

 is connected.

Let W be the union of all small components of 
 which contains no vertices of 
. Now, we attempt to prove that . Suppose, to the contrary, that . Assume that 
 subject to 
. In this regard, we have 
. By means of Lemma 2, 
. So, we obtain
 Notice that each vertex in W has exactly three external neighbors, 
. As a result,
 Clearly,  which contradicts to . Hence, we have , which implies that F is not a 2-extra vertex-cut of 
, a contradiction. Consequently, the lower bound that 
 is expected, as desired.

Therefore, Theorem 5 holds. □

It is worth noting that, Lin et al. [24] established a general relationship on g-extra connectivity and g-extra diagnosability for regular networks under the PMC diagnostic model as below.

Lemma 3

[24] For the n-regular network G , if 
 and there exist a connected subgraph X in G satisfies that  and  is the minimum g-extra cut of G, then

Applying Theorem 4, Theorem 5, we obtain {1, 2}-extra diagnosability of 
 under the PMC diagnostic strategy, written as 
 and 
, respectively.
