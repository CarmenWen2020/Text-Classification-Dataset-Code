Abstract
The fractional (strong) matching preclusion number of a graph G, denoted by f(s)mp(G), is the minimum number of edges (and vertices) whose deletion results in a graph with no fractional perfect matching. Let Gn1,n2,…,nk be the complete k-partite graph, whose vertex set can be partitioned into k parts, each has ni(1≤i≤k) vertices and whose edge set contains all edges between two distinct parts. In this paper, we determine fmp(Gn1,n2,…,nk) and fsmp(Gn1,n2,…,nk).

1. Introduction
1.1. Matching preclusion
The interconnection network serves as the underlying topology of large-scale parallel and distributed system. The stability of the network plays an important role in the process of information transmission. In certain applications, every node of the network requires a single partner at any given time. The matching preclusion number measures the resiliency of this requirement in the event of edge failure. Brigham et al. [1] first used the concept of matching preclusion to measure the stability of interconnection network in 2005.

In recent years, the matching preclusion problem has received much attention, there are many related papers about matching preclusion number involving in some classes of graphs such as hypercube [1], k-ary n-cube [22], tori network [7], balanced hypercube [16], folded Petersen cube [2], cube-connected cycle [10], binary de Bruijn graph [12], pancake and burnt pancake graph [5], bipartite graphs [3], [4], regular graphs [6], [11], vertex-transitive graphs [9], product of graphs [7], [11], [13], [21] et al.

A matching in a graph is a set of edges such that every vertex is incident with at most one edge in this set. A perfect matching in a graph is a set of edges such that every vertex is incident with exactly one edge in this set. An almost-perfect matching in a graph is a set of edges such that every vertex, except one, is incident with exactly one edge in this set, and the exceptional vertex is incident with none. So if a graph has a perfect matching, then it has an even number of vertices. If a graph has an almost-perfect matching, then it has an odd number of vertices. A matching preclusion set (MP set) of a graph G, is a set of edges whose deletion leaves the graph G with neither perfect matchings nor almost-perfect matchings. The matching preclusion number of a graph G, denoted by , is the minimum cardinality of matching preclusion sets in G.

1.2. Fractional matching preclusion
In 2017, Liu et al. [14] introduced fractional matching preclusion (FMP) number, fractional strong matching preclusion (FSMP) number and studied them for complete graphs, Petersen graph and twisted cubes.

Recently, there are some results about FMP or FSMP number for some special graphs, such as arrangement graphs [17], -star graphs [18], the restricted HL-graphs [24], product networks [20], the multiply twisted cube [8], the locally twisted cube [8], and DHcube [23].

A fractional matching is a function f that assigns to each edge a number in  such that 
 for each vertex v, where the sum is taken over all edges e incident to v. If  for each edge e, then f is just a matching. Clearly, 
 
 
  
 
 

The fractional matching number of G, denoted by 
, is the supremum of 
 over all fractional matching f. A fractional perfect matching is a fractional matching f satisfying that 
 for every . Clearly, a fractional matching f is perfect if and only if 
 
 and a perfect matching is a fractional perfect matching.

A subset  is a fractional MP set (FMP set) if  has no fractional perfect matching. The FMP  of G, denoted by , is the minimum size of FMP sets of G, that is,

A set  is a fractional strong matching preclusion set (FSMP set) if  has no fractional perfect matchings. The   of G, denoted by , is the minimum size of FSMP sets of G, that is, It is easy to see that .

In this paper, we obtain the following two theorems.

The rest of this article is organized as follows. We introduce some notations and useful results in Section 2. We prove Theorem 1.1 in Section 3 and Theorem 1.2 in Section 4.

2. Notations and useful results
All graphs considered in this paper are simple, finite and undirected. For a graph G, let ,  denote the vertex set and edge set of G, respectively. Let . We use  to denote the subgraph of G obtained by removing all the vertices in X together with the edges incident to them from G as well as removing all the edges in X from G. If , we write  instead of . Let  and , we denote . The degree of a vertex v in G, denoted by , is the number of edges of G incident to v. Let  be the minimum degree of G. Let

 with 
 and whose edge set contains all edges between two distinct parts. Assume that

 edge disjoint perfect matchings. Therefore . If , then we obtain a complete balanced bipartite graph H by deleting all the edges between two distinct parts

 or , we obtain . Therefore . We can find two vertices  such that  and . Indeed, since 
 and , we have
 
 
 
 Therefore there exists a vertex  such that . Without loss of generality, we assume that 
,  and  for any other vertex v. If , we can choose v such that  since . Suppose that  and 
. Since 
 and , there exists an edge, say , such that 
. Clearly u and v are the two adjacent vertices we desire.

Let
