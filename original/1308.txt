Abstract
The Rg-conditional diagnosability of a multiprocessor system modeled by a graph G, denoted by tRg(G), is a generalization of conditional diagnosability, which restricts every vertex contains at least g fault-free neighbors. Particularly, the R1-conditional diagnosability is the conditional diagnosability. The Rg-conditional connectivity of a graph G, denoted by κRg(G), is the minimum number of vertices, whose deletion will disconnect the graph and every vertex of G has at least g neighbors in the remaining subgraphs. In this paper, the relationships between the Rg-conditional connectivity of a graph G and its Rg-conditional diagnosability under the PMC and MM* models are explored. We establish the Rg-conditional diagnosability tRg(G) equals κR2g+1(G)+g under some reasonable conditions, except the R1-conditional diagnosability of G under the MM* model. Moreover, we show under the MM* model, tR1(G)=κR2(G) with similar conditions. Applying our results, the Rg-conditional diagnosability of the (n,k)-star graphs and the (n,k)-bubble-sort graphs are determined.

1. Introduction
With the rapid development of VLSI technology, a multiprocessor system may contain thousands of processors. As the processor size increases, the probability of processor failure in the system increases, which will affect the reliability of the system. Therefore, in order to maintain the reliability of such systems, the fault processors should be recognized and replaced in time. The process of identifying fault processors is called fault diagnosis of the system.

In 1967, Preparata et al. [17] proposed a system-level diagnosis model, which could test the processors automatically by the system itself. The diagnosability of a system is the maximum number of faulty nodes that the system can self-identify, which is an important metric for measuring its reliability. However, due to the classical diagnosability generally assumed that any subset of processors can potentially fail simultaneously, it always underestimates the resilience of mass processor systems. To make up for this disadvantage, in 2005, Lai et al. [13] proposed the conditional diagnosability by restricting that every processor contains at least one fault-free neighboring node. In 2012, Peng et al. [18] further defined the g-good-neighbor conditional diagnosability by restricting every fault-free processor has not less than g fault-free neighboring nodes. Motivated by the above two concepts, Guo et al. [7] generalized the conditional diagnosability to 
-conditional diagnosability by requiring every processor has at least g fault-free neighboring nodes. In particular, the 
-conditional diagnosability is the conditional diagnosability.

The system-level fault diagnosis of a multiprocessor system depends on the establishment of test models. Different test models have different test methods and interpretations of test results. The Preparata, Metze, and Chien model [17] (PMC model for short) and the Maeng and Malek model [16] (shortly MM model) are the most commonly used test models. In the PMC model, every pair of adjacent nodes can test each other, and the outcome of a test performed by a fault-free node is 1 (respectively, 0) if the tested node is faulty (respectively, fault-free), whereas the outcome of a test performed by a faulty tester is unreliable. In the MM model, to diagnose a system, a node sends the same task to two of its neighbors, and then compares their responses. Sengupta and Dahbura [19] proposed a special case of the MM model, called the MM* model, in which each node must test its any pair of adjacent nodes. Throughout this paper, we only consider the PMC and MM* models.

The 
-conditional diagnosability of several kinds of networks, such as hypercubes [13], [9], exchanged crossed cubes [6], BC networks [27], [10], folded hypercubes [28], matching composition networks [22], etc., was evaluated. Lin [14] and Hao [8] et al. investigated the relationships between the 
-conditional diagnosability and the extra connectivity of a graph under the MM* model, respectively. In 2020, Guo et al. [7] investigated the 
-conditional diagnosability of hypercubes under the PMC model for 
 
 and 
. Recently, utilizing the results on the g-extra connectivity of hypercubes, Wang et al. [24] showed a new lower boundary on the 
-conditional diagnosability of hypercubes under the PMC model. There are few studies on the 
-conditional diagnosability of other networks for .

The 
-conditional connectivity of a graph G is the minimum cardinality of a vertex subset F, whose deletion will disconnect the graph G and for every vertex , v has not less than g neighbors in . Note the similarity of the definitions of 
-conditional diagnosability and 
-conditional connectivity of a network G. A quite natural problem is what is the relationship between the 
-conditional diagnosability of G and its 
-conditional connectivity? The study in [7] investigated the relation between the 
-conditional connectivity and the 
-conditional diagnosability of hypercubes under the PMC model.

In this paper, we show some relationships between the 
-conditional connectivity 
 and the 
-conditional diagnosability 
 of an interconnection network G under the PMC and MM* models. Applying our results, the 
-conditional diagnosability of -star graphs and the -bubble-sort graphs are obtained.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we recall some terminologies, notations and results on graphs and diagnosability. In Section 3, we show some equivalent relations between the 
-conditional connectivity 
 and the 
-conditional diagnosability 
 under the PMC and MM* models. In Section 4 and Section 5, the 
-conditional diagnosability of -star graphs and the -bubble-sort graphs are determined. Section 6 concludes this paper.

2. Preliminaries
Throughout this paper, an interconnection network is represented by an undirected simple graph G with vertex set  and edge set . For a vertex , the number of edges incident with v is said to be the degree of vertex v, denoted by 
. A graph G is called k-regular if for any vertex v, 
. For any vertex , define the neighborhood 
 of v in G to be the set of vertices adjacent to v. Let , we use 
 to denote the set 
. For degrees and neighborhoods, we always omit the subscript for the graph when no confusion arises.

A graph H is called a subgraph of G, denoted by , if ,  and the endpoints of every edge in  belong to . Let 
 and 
 be two subgraphs of G. The join of 
 and 
 is a subgraph of G with vertex set 
 and edge set 
 if 
. For a nonempty subset 
 of , the induced subgraph 
 by 
 in G, is a graph with 
 and 
. Let ,  denotes a graph obtained by deleting all the vertices in F and the edges with at least one endpoint in F. A cycle C is a sequence 
 of adjacent vertices, where 
 are distinct pairwise. The length of cycle C is the number of vertices in C. A cycle C of length k is called a k-cycle. A subset  is an independent set if any two vertices of X are not adjacent in G. The vertex number of the maximum independent set in G is called the independent number of G, denoted by .

If there is a nonempty subset  such that  is disconnected, then F is called a cut of G. The connectivity  of graph G is the cardinality of the minimum cut (if any). Let F be a nonempty subset of , define  is the order of the maximum component of . Given two sets 
, the symmetric difference of 
 and 
, 
. For graph-theoretical terminologies and notations not defined here we follow [1].

In what follows, some concepts and results on diagnosability of a system are listed.

Definition 2.1

[11]
A vertex subset F is said to be an 
-set of G if  for every vertex . Furthermore, if an 
-set F satisfies  is disconnected, then we call F is an 
-cut.

Definition 2.2

[11]
A graph G is said to be 
-connected if G has an 
-cut. The 
-conditional connectivity of G, denoted by 
, is the cardinality of a minimum 
-cut of G.

The g-super connectivity is an important index closed to the 
-conditional connectivity.

Definition 2.3

[11]
A subset  is called a g-super cut of G if  is disconnected and the minimum degree  is at least g. The g-super connectivity 
 is defined as the cardinality of the minimum g-super cut of G.

Definition 2.4

[7]
A graph G is said to be 
-conditional t-diagnosable if an arbitrary pair of distinct 
-sets 
 with 
 and 
, are distinguishable. The 
-conditional diagnosability of G, denoted by 
, is the maximum t such that G is 
-conditional t-diagnosable.

In 1984, Dahbura and Masson [5] proposed a sufficient and necessary condition for two distinct subsets 
 and 
 to be a distinguishable pair under the PMC model.

Lemma 2.5

[5]
In 1992, Dahbura and Masson [19] proposed a sufficient and necessary condition for two distinct subsets 
 and 
 to be a distinguishable pair under the MM* model.

Lemma 2.6

[19]

 and 
 of ,

3. The relationship between the 
-conditional diagnosability and the 
-conditional connectivity
In this section, we shall investigate the relationships between the 
-conditional connectivity and the 
-conditional diagnosability of G under the PMC and MM* models. We first discuss the upper boundary of the 
-conditional diagnosability of G under the PMC and MM* models, which is related to the 
-conditional connectivity of G.

Lemma 3.1

Let g be a positive integer, and let G be an 
-connected graph. If there is a connected subgraph H in G such that 
 and  is a minimum 
-cut of G, then 
 under the PMC and MM* models.

Proof

Since  is a minimum 
-cut of G, 
. Assume 
. Let 
, and let 
. Then 
 and 
 are both 
-sets of G, and 
. Since 
, there is no edge of G between 
 and 
. By Lemma 2.5, Lemma 2.6 and Definition 2.4, we can deduce that G is not 
-conditional 
-diagnosable under the PMC model and MM* model. Hence, by the definition of the 
-conditional diagnosability, we conclude that under the PMC and MM* models, the 
-conditional diagnosability of G is less than 
, that is, 
. The proof is complete. □

Now, we show a lower boundary of the 
-conditional diagnosability of G under the PMC model.

Lemma 3.2

Let g be a positive integer, and let G be an 
-connected graph with order n. If G satisfies the following two conditions:

(1)
,

(2)
 for any vertex subset  with 
,

then 
 under the PMC model.
Proof

Suppose on the contrary that 
. By the definition of 
, there exists a pair of 
-sets 
 with 
 and 
 such that 
 and 
 are indistinguishable. Let 
. By condition (1),(1)
 that is, . By Lemma 2.5, there exists no edge between 
 and U. Combining this with 
 being 
-sets, we deduce the minimum degrees of the induced subgraphs both 
 and 
 are not less than g, and 
 for any vertex 
. It implies that every component of 
 and 
 contains at least  vertices. So 
.

Assume u is an arbitrary vertex in 
. Without loss of generality, assume 
. Let 
 be a component of 
 such that 
. Since every component of 
 contains at least  vertices, 
. Note that 
 for every vertex 
. So there exists a vertex 
 such that . Let 
 be a component of 
 such that 
. Then by every component of 
 contains at least  vertices, 
. Let H be a component of 
 such that . Clearly, 
. By the arbitrariness of u, we can deduce every component of 
 contains at least  vertices. Thus 
.

Combining 
 and 
, we have 
. By condition (2), 
 is either connected or it consists of a large component and small components containing at most  vertices in total. Note that every component of 
 contains at least  vertices and there exists no edge between 
 and U. So  contains at most  vertices, that is, , contradicting (1). The proof is complete. □

From Lemma 3.1, Lemma 3.2, we directly obtain the following proper relationship between the 
-conditional connectivity and the 
-conditional diagnosability of G under the PMC model.

Theorem 3.3

Let g be a positive integer, and let G be an 
-connected graph with order n. If G satisfies the following three conditions:

(1)
,

(2)
there is a connected subgraph H of G such that 
 and  is a minimum 
-cut of G,

(3)
 for any vertex subset  with 
,

then 
 under the PMC model.
In fact, under the MM* model, the upper boundary of 
-conditional diagnosability of G presented in Lemma 3.1 is not tight. A tight upper boundary of 
-conditional diagnosability of G under the MM* model is presented as follows.

Lemma 3.4

Let G be an 
-connected graph. If there is a connected subgraph H in G such that 
 and  is a minimum 
-cut of G, then 
 under the MM* model.

Proof

Since  is a minimum 
-cut of G, 
. Assume 
. Let 
, and let 
. Then 
 and 
 are both 
-sets of G, 
, and 
. Let 
. By the definitions of 
 and 
, there is no edge between 
 and U. By Lemma 2.6, 
 and 
 are indistinguishable. It follows that G is not 
-conditional 
-diagnosable under the MM* model. Hence, by the definition of 
-conditional diagnosability, we conclude that under the MM* model, the 
-conditional diagnosability of G is less than 
, that is, 
. The proof is complete. □

We shall show the 
-conditional connectivity 
 is also a lower boundary of the 
-conditional diagnosability 
 under the MM* model.

Lemma 3.5

Let G be an 
-connected graph with order 
, where  is the independent number of G. If  for any vertex subset  with 
, then 
 under the MM* model.

Proof

Suppose on the contrary that 
. By the definition of 
, there exists a pair of distinct 
-sets 
 with 
 and 
 such that 
 and 
 are indistinguishable.

Note that 
. So without loss of generality assume that 
, say 
. We shall show 
. Suppose on the contrary that 
. Since

-set, there exists a pair of vertices 
 such that . And by 
, we can deduce that 
. By Lemma 2.6(1), 
 and 
 are distinguishable, a contradiction. Thus 
 and 
.

Let W be the set of isolated vertices in 
, and let 
. Clearly, W is an independent set of G. So . Since

On the other hand, by the definition of U, we have . Since 
 and 
 are indistinguishable, by Lemma 2.6(1), there is no edge between 
 and U. It follows that

 and 
. We have 
. And by assumption that  for any vertex subset  with 
, we deduce

We shall show every component of the induced subgraph 
 contains at least 3 vertices. Let C be a component of 
. Suppose , say . Since both 
 and 
 are 
-sets, 
 and 
. It implies that . Suppose , that is, 
. Without loss of generality, assume 
, say 
. Since 
 and 
 are 
-sets, we have 
 and 
. It follows that . Therefore, every component of the induced subgraph 
 contains at least 3 vertices.

Note that 
 consists of a large component and small components containing at most 2 vertices in total. So, , contradicting . The proof is complete. □

By Lemma 3.4, Lemma 3.5, we can obtain the 
-conditional diagnosability of G under the MM* model.

Theorem 3.6

Let G be an 
-connected graph with order 
, where  is the independent number of G. If G satisfies the following two conditions:

(1)
there is a connected subgraph H in G such that 
 and  is a minimum 
-cut of G,

(2)
for any vertex subset  with 
, ,

then 
 under the MM* model.
Next, we shall explore the lower boundary of the 
-conditional diagnosability of G under the MM* model for .

Lemma 3.7

Let  be an integer, and let G be an 
-connected graph with order n. If G satisfies the following two conditions:

(1)

Proof

Suppose on the contrary that 
. By the definition of

-sets 
 with

 such that 
 and 
 are indistinguishable. Let W be the set of isolated vertices in 
.

Claim 1

.

Suppose on the contrary that there exists a vertex . Since

-set and 
, 
. By Lemma 2.6 (3), 
 and 
 are distinguishable, a contradiction.

Let 
. By 
, we deduce 
, that is, . By Claim 1, there is no isolated vertex in H.

We shall show there is no edge between 
 and . Otherwise, suppose there is an edge  such that 
 and . Since there is no isolated vertex in H, there is a vertex  such that . By Lemma 2.6(1), 
 and 
 are distinguishable, a contradiction.

Since

-sets and there is no edge between

 and 
 are both not less than g, and 
 for any vertex 
. It follows that every component of

 contains at most  vertices. It follows that 
, contradicting condition (1). The proof is complete. □

By Lemma 3.1, Lemma 3.7, we directly obtain the 
-conditional diagnosability of G under the MM* model, where .

Theorem 3.8

4. The 
-conditional connectivity and the 
-conditional diagnosability of -star graphs
In this section, we shall discuss the 
-conditional connectivity and the 
-conditional diagnosability of the -star graph. The -star graph 
, proposed by Chiang and Chen [2], is a special structure based on the coset of symmetry group, and preserves most attractive properties of the n-dimensional star graph 
. The -star graph is defined as follows.

Definition 4.1

[2]
The -star graph, denoted by 
, is specified by two integers n and k, where . The vertex set 
. The edge set of 
 is defined as follows:

(1)
A vertex 
 is adjacent to the vertex 
 through an edge of dimension i, where  (i.e., exchange 
 with 
).

(2)
A vertex 
 is adjacent to the vertex 
 through an edge of dimension 1, where 
 (i.e., replace 
 by x).

Clearly, the -star graph 
 is -regular and has 
 
 vertices. The edges of type (1) are referred to as swap-edges, and the edges of type (2) are referred to as unswap-edges. In particular, the -star graph 
 is the n-dimensional star graph 
 when . The -star graph 
 and the 4-dimensional star graph 
 are given in Fig. 3.

Li et al. [12] determined the g-super connectivity of -star graph 
 for  and . Chang et al. [3] investigated the conditional diagnosability of 
 under the MM* model. Xu et al. [21] showed that the g-good-neighbor diagnosability of the -star graph 
 under the PMC and MM* models for  and  are both . Afterward, Wei et al. [25] generalized the results of Xu et al. [21], and determined the g-good-neighbor diagnosability of the -star graph 
 for  and  under the same models.

The g-super connectivity of -star graph 
 is useful in this section, which is as follows.

Theorem 4.2

[12]
The g-super connectivity of -star graph 
 is 
 for  and .

The relationship between the g-super connectivity and the 
-conditional connectivity is discussed as follows.

Proposition 4.3

Let G be an 
-connected graph. Then 
.

Proof

Since G is an 
-connected graph, G has at least an 
-cut and a g-super cut. Let  and  be the sets of 
-cuts and g-super cuts of G, respectively. By definitions of the 
-cut and the g-super cut, we have . Furthermore, by the definitions of 
 and 
, 
, and hence 
. The proof is complete. □

Combining Theorem 4.2 and Proposition 4.3, we can easily deduce a lower boundary of 
-conditional connectivity of -star graph for  and .

Corollary 4.4

The 
-conditional connectivity of -star graph 
 is 
 for  and .

Next, we shall discuss the upper boundary of the 
-conditional connectivity of -star graphs. The following two lemmas are useful.

Lemma 4.5

[4]
In 
, a cycle has length at least 6 if it contains a swap-edge.

For a given integer n with , let 
. For an integer k with , let

Lemma 4.6

Let  and let vertex set

-cut of

 for any . Suppose there is a common neighbor z in 
 for a pair of vertices 
. Then xz and

 have length at least 6. On the other hand, since 
,

, a contradiction. So there is no common neighbor in 
 for any pair of vertices 
. It follows that 
.

Next, we shall show F is an 
-cut of 
. By  and , we can deduce 
 
. So F is a cut of 
.

Now, we are just going to prove that F is an 
-set of 
. Clearly, for any 
, , and hence .

Let u be an arbitrary vertex of 
. By the definition of 
, there is a vertex  such that 
 and ux is a swap-edge. Suppose there is a vertex 
 such that 
. Then  is a triangle of 
. On the other hand, by Lemma 4.5, a cycle containing edge ux has length at least 6, a contradiction. Suppose there is a vertex 
 such that 
. By the definition of 
, there is a vertex 
 such that 
. Then 
 is a 4-cycle of 
, which contradicts a cycle containing edge ux has length at least 6. Therefore, .

Let y be an arbitrary vertex of Y. Suppose there is a vertex 
 such that 
. Clearly yv is a swap-edge. By Lemma 4.5, a cycle containing edge yv has length at least 6. If there is another vertex 
 such that 
, then 
 is a triangle of 
, contradicting a cycle containing edge yv has length at least 6. Suppose there is a vertex 
 such that 
. Then by the definition of 
, there is a vertex  such that 
. It follows that  is a 4-cycle of 
, which contradicts a cycle containing edge ux has length at least 6. Therefore, . Similarly, we can deduce  if there is a vertex 
 such that 
. Suppose there is no vertex  such that 
. Then . Therefore, F is an 
-set of 
. The proof is complete. □

-conditional connectivity of the -star graph

-conditional diagnosability of -star graph 
 under the MM* model is 
 for  and 
 
.

Proof

With a similar discussion in the proof of Theorem 4.9, Theorem 4.12 holds from Theorem 3.8. □

5. The 
-conditional connectivity and the 
-conditional diagnosability of -bubble-sort graphs
In this section, we shall discuss the 
-conditional connectivity and the 
-conditional diagnosability of the -bubble-sort graphs. The -bubble-sort graph, proposed by Shawash [20], is a generalization of the n-dimensional bubble-sort graph, which preserves most attractive properties of the n-dimensional bubble-sort graph. The -bubble-sort graph is defined as follows.

Definition 5.1

[20]
The -bubble-sort graph, denoted by 
, is specified by two integers n and k, where . The vertex set 
. The edge set of 
 is defined as follows:

(1)
A vertex 
 is adjacent to the vertex 
 for  (i.e., exchange 
 with 
).

(2)
A vertex 
 is adjacent to the vertex 
, where 
 (i.e., replace 
 by x).

Clearly, the -bubble-sort graph 
 is -regular and has 
 
 vertices. The edges of type (1) are referred to as swap-edges, and the edges of type (2) are referred to as unswap-edges. In particular, the -bubble-sort graph 
 is the n-dimensional bubble-sort graph 
 when . The -bubble-sort graph and the 4-dimensional bubble-sort graph are given in Fig. 4.

 and

 is 
 for 
 
 and 
 
.

Combining Lemma 5.2 and Proposition 4.3, we can easily deduce a lower boundary of the 
-conditional connectivity of the -bubble-sort network 
 for

-conditional connectivity of the -bubble-sort network 
 is

Next, we shall discuss the upper boundary of the 
-conditional connectivity of -bubble-sort networks. The following three lemmas are useful.

Lemma 5.4

Lemma 5.5

[26]
Let

Lemma 5.6

Let

-cut of

Claim 2

Let

Consider

Consider 
 and 
, where . Let

. So assume 
, where 
 and 
 for . Suppose

 but does not contain the symbol 
, and 
 contains the symbol

 and 
 are not adjacent. Therefore, there is no edge between 
 and 
, where . The claim is proved.

The following three cases need to be considered.

Case 1.

Theorem 5.7

The 
-conditional connectivity of the -bubble-sort network 
 is 
 for

By Lemma 5.6 and the definition of 
-conditional connectivity, we have 
. Combining this with Corollary 5.3, the result holds. □

Lemma 5.8

Let H be a subgraph of

 and 
 
. Then .

Proof

We shall prove the lemma by induction on . Clearly, the result holds for  since

If 
 for some , then by Lemma 5.6, we have , the result holds. Suppose there is some dimension , such that H traverses at least two of

 as 
. Without loss of generality, assume 
. Suppose that 
 and 
. Then 
 and 
.

Assume that 
. Then 
. By the induction hypothesis, we have
 and
 Thus, we have
 Note that for

We will discuss the 
-conditional diagnosability of the -bubble-sort network next.

For the convenience of discussion, we first give some notations. Let F be a vertex subset of 
. Let

 induced by all the vertices having the symbol i in the kth dimension. For any integer 
, we set 
. We also let 
, 
, 
, 
, and 
, 
. It is clear that 
 is connected for any .

Lemma 5.9

For any subset 
 with , where 
 
 and 
 
,

Proof

We first show a useful claim as follows.

Claim 3

 with , where 
 
 and 
 
. Furthermore, 
 
.

According to the size of k, discuss the following three cases.

Case 1. .

In this case, . By the definition of I, we have . It implies . Note that , then 
. Since there exists 
 
 swap-edge between any two subgraphs 
 and

 and for any

, we have 
 is still connected. To show that 
 is connected, it suffices to show that

. Let 
 and 
. Since there exists at least one vertex in 
 for any

 Thus, we have for any 
,
 which implies that 
 is connected to

 is connected.

Note that . Then 
. Combining  and 
 
, we have
 
 
 
 

Case 2. .

In this case, . Then we have . It implies that . Consider the following two subcases.

Subcase 2.1. 
.

Note that there exist 
 
 
 swap-edges between two subgraphs 
 and 
 for any 
. Then

 is still connected to 
 for any 
. Let 
 and 
. Since there exists at least one vertex in 
 for any 
, it follows that
 Thus, we have for any

 is connected to 
. By the arbitrariness of 
, 
 is connected.

Similar to Case 1, we can deduce 
 
.

Subcase 2.2. 
.

In this case, every 
 contains at least one vertex for 
. Let 
. Then we have 
 
, that is, any pair of 
, contain at most  vertices. It follows that 
. Since 
 for any 
, 
 is still connected. Note that there exist 
 
 
 swap-edges between any two subgraphs 
 and 
, where . And as any pair of 
, contain at most  vertices, 
 is connected to 
, where 
. By the arbitrariness of i and j, 
 is connected.

Note that 
. Similar to Case 1, we have 
 
.

Case 3. .

The subgraph 
 is still connected for any  because 
. For any , the number of swap-edges between 
 and 
, 
 
 
, which implies that 
 is connected to 
. By the arbitrariness of i and j, 
 is connected to 
.

Note that 
 
 and 
 
. Then  and
 
 
 
 By the definition of I, we have 
 
 
 
. It implies that 
 
. Hence 
 
. Therefore,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The proof of Claim 3 is complete.

Let H be the union of small components of 
. By Claim 3, 
. We shall show . Suppose, on the contrary, that . Take a subset  with . Clearly, 
. By Lemma 5.8, we have
 Since each vertex in H is exactly incident with one swap-edge, 
. Thus, we have
 a contradiction. Therefore, . The lemma holds. □

6. Conclusions
In this paper, we investigate the relationships between the 
-conditional connectivity 
 and the 
-conditional diagnosability 
 under the PMC and MM* models, and show that 
 under some reasonable conditions, except 
 under the MM* model. Moreover, we show that 
 with some similar conditions. Applying our results, the 
-conditional diagnosability of the -star graphs and the -bubble-sort graphs are determined. We think, with a similar discussion, the 
-conditional diagnosability of general hypercubes 
 and date center networks 
 also can be determined.
