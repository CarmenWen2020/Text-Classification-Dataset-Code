Abstract
We study the effect of noise on the classical simulatability of quantum circuits defined by computationally tractable (CT) states and efficiently computable sparse (ECS) operations. Examples of such circuits, which we call CT-ECS circuits, are IQP, Clifford Magic, and conjugated Clifford circuits. This means that there exist various CT-ECS circuits such that their output probability distributions are anti-concentrated and not classically simulatable in the noise-free setting (under plausible assumptions). First, we consider a noise model where a depolarizing channel with an arbitrarily small constant rate is applied to each qubit at the end of computation. We show that, under this noise model, if an approximate value of the noise rate is known, any CT-ECS circuit with an anti-concentrated output probability distribution is classically simulatable. This indicates that the presence of small noise drastically affects the classical simulatability of CT-ECS circuits. Then, we consider an extension of the noise model where the noise rate can vary with each qubit, and provide a similar sufficient condition for classically simulating CT-ECS circuits with anti-concentrated output probability distributions.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background and main results
A key step toward realizing a large-scale universal quantum computer is to demonstrate quantum computational supremacy [11], i.e., to perform computational tasks that are classically hard. As such a task, many researchers have focused on simulating quantum circuits, or more concretely, sampling the output probability distributions of quantum circuits. They have shown that, under plausible complexity-theoretic assumptions, this task is classically hard for various quantum circuits that seem easier to implement than universal ones. However, these classical hardness results have been obtained in severely restricted settings, such as a noise-free setting with additive approximation [5], [18], [3], [21] and a noise setting with multiplicative approximation [9]: the former requires us to sample the output probability distribution of a quantum circuit with additive error and the latter to sample it under a noise model with multiplicative error. Thus, there is great interest in considering the above task in a more reasonable setting.

We study the classical simulatability of quantum circuits in a noise setting with additive approximation, which requires us to sample the output probability distribution of a quantum circuit under a noise model with additive error. This setting is more reasonable than the noise-free setting since the presence of noise is unavoidable in realistic situations. Moreover, our setting is more reasonable than the noise setting with multiplicative approximation in the sense that we adopt a more realistic notion of approximation [1], [5], although noise we deal with in this paper is more restrictive than that in [9].

We consider a noise model where a depolarizing channel 
 with an arbitrarily small constant rate  is applied to each qubit at the end of computation. This channel leaves a qubit unaffected with probability  and replaces its state with the completely mixed one with probability ε. We call this model noise model A. We also consider its extension where the noise rate can vary with each qubit. More concretely, when we have n qubits, 
 is applied to the j-th qubit at the end of computation for any . We call this model noise model B. Although these noise models are simple, analyzing them is a meaningful step toward studying more general noise models, such as one where noise exists before and after each gate in a quantum circuit [10]. This is because, for example, this general model is equivalent to noise model A when we focus on instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) circuits, which are described below, with a particular type of intermediate noise [6].

A representative example of a quantum circuit that is not classically simulatable in the noise-free setting is an IQP circuit, which consists of Z-diagonal gates sandwiched by two Hadamard layers. In fact, there exists an IQP circuit such that its output probability distribution is anti-concentrated and not classically samplable in polynomial time with certain constant accuracy in 
 norm (under plausible assumptions) [5]. On the other hand, Bremner et al. [6] assumed noise model A and showed that, if the exact value of the noise rate is known, any IQP circuit with an anti-concentrated output probability distribution is classically simulatable in the sense that the resulting probability distribution is classically samplable in polynomial time with arbitrary constant accuracy in 
 norm. This indicates that, under noise model A, if the exact value of the noise rate is known, the presence of small noise drastically affects the classical simulatability of IQP circuits.

In this paper, first, under a weaker assumption on the knowledge of the noise rate, we extend Bremner et al.'s result to a new class of quantum circuits defined by two concepts: computationally tractable (CT) states and efficiently computable sparse (ECS) operations [20]. Examples of such circuits, which we call CT-ECS circuits, are IQP circuits, Clifford Magic circuits [21], and conjugated Clifford circuits [3]. This means that there exist various CT-ECS circuits such that their output probability distributions are anti-concentrated and not classically simulatable in the sense described above for IQP circuits. Constant-depth quantum circuits [19], [4], [2] are also CT-ECS circuits and not classically simulatable, although we do not know whether their output probability distributions are anti-concentrated. We postpone the explanation of CT states and ECS operations until Section 2, but, as depicted in Fig. 1(a), a CT-ECS circuit on n qubits is a polynomial-size quantum circuit  such that 
 is CT and 
 is ECS for any , where 
 is a Pauli-Z operation on the j-th qubit. After performing C, we perform Z-basis measurements on all qubits. The CT-ECS circuit C under noise model B is depicted in Fig. 1(b).

 for any 1 ≤ j ≤ n.

Our first result assumes noise model A, which corresponds to the case where 
 for any  in Fig. 1(b). We show that, if an approximate value of the noise rate is known, any CT-ECS circuit with an anti-concentrated output probability distribution is classically simulatable:

Theorem 1 informal

Let C be an arbitrary CT-ECS circuit on n qubits such that its output probability distribution p is anti-concentrated, i.e., 
 for some known constant . We assume that a depolarizing channel with (possibly unknown) constant rate  is applied to each qubit after performing C, which yields the probability distribution 
. Moreover, we assume that it is possible to choose a constant λ such that
 
 where c is a certain constant depending on α. Then, 
 is classically samplable in time 
 
 with constant accuracy in 
 norm.

If ε is known, we can choose . This case with IQP circuits is Bremner et al.'s result [6]. As described above, there exist various CT-ECS circuits such that their output probability distributions are anti-concentrated and not classically simulatable in the noise-free setting (under plausible assumptions). Thus, Theorem 1 indicates that, under noise model A, if an approximate value of the noise rate is known, the presence of small noise drastically affects the classical simulatability of CT-ECS circuits.
Theorem 1 assumes noise model A where noise exists only at the end of computation, but, in some cases, it also holds under an input-noise model. For example, Theorem 1 holds for IQP circuits under a noise model where 
 is applied to each qubit only at the start of computation, although Bu and Koh's main result implies a similar property of IQP circuits [7]. Moreover, Theorem 2, which is described below and assumes noise model B, also holds for IQP circuits under an input-noise model where the noise rate can vary with each qubit. Our main result is similar in spirit to Bu and Koh's, which provides classical algorithms for simulating Clifford circuits with nonstabilizer product input states (corresponding to input-noise models). However, in general, it is difficult to relate the output probability distributions of Clifford circuits under input-noise models to those of CT-ECS circuits under output-noise models.

Our main focus is on a noise setting, but, from a purely theoretical point of view, it is valuable to consider the noise-free setting. The proof method of Theorem 1 is based on computing the Fourier coefficients of an output probability distribution, and is useful in the noise-free setting. In fact, the proof method shows that, when only  qubits are measured, any quantum circuit in a class of CT-ECS circuits on n qubits is classically simulatable. More precisely, its output probability distribution is classically samplable in polynomial time with polynomial accuracy in 
 norm. This class of CT-ECS circuits is defined by a restricted version of ECS operations, and includes IQP, Clifford Magic, conjugated Clifford, and constant-depth quantum circuits. It is known that the above property or a similar one holds for these quantum circuits, but the proofs provided have depended on each circuit class [19], [4], [12], [3]. Our analysis unifies the previous ones and clarifies a class of quantum circuits for which the above property holds.

Our second result assumes noise model B, which is depicted in Fig. 1(b). For classically simulating CT-ECS circuits with anti-concentrated output probability distributions, we provide a sufficient condition, which is similar to Theorem 1:

Theorem 2 informal

Let C be an arbitrary CT-ECS circuit on n qubits such that its output probability distribution p is anti-concentrated, i.e., 
 for some known constant . We assume that a depolarizing channel with (possibly unknown) constant rate 
 is applied to the j-th qubit after performing C for any , which yields the probability distribution 
. Moreover, we assume that it is possible to choose a constant 
 such that
 
 where 
 and c is a certain constant depending on α, and we assume that it is possible to choose a constant 
 such that
 for any  with 
. Then, 
 is classically samplable in time 
 
 with constant accuracy in 
 norm.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis of the classical simulatability of quantum circuits under noise model B. Theorem 2 indicates that, under this noise model, if approximate values of the minimum noise rate and the other noise rates are known, the presence of small noise drastically affects the classical simulatability of CT-ECS circuits.
1.2. Overview of techniques
To prove Theorem 1, we generalize Bremner et al.'s proof for IQP circuits [6]. The first key point is to provide a general method for approximating the Fourier coefficients of the output probability distribution p. The probability distribution 
, which we want to approximate, can be simply represented by the noise rate ε and the Fourier coefficients 
 of p for all 
 [15]. We show that, for any CT-ECS circuit on n qubits, there exists a polynomial-time classical algorithm for approximating each of the low-degree Fourier coefficients, i.e., 
 for any 
 with 
. Bremner et al. [6] showed that such an algorithm exists for IQP circuits through a direct calculation of the Fourier coefficients for them. In contrast, we first provide a general relation between a quantum circuit and the Fourier coefficients of its output probability distribution. We then approximate each of the low-degree Fourier coefficients by combining this general relation with Nest's classical algorithm for approximating the inner product represented by a CT state and an ECS operation [20]. This general relation seems to be a new tool to investigate the output probability distribution of a quantum circuit and thus may be of independent interest.

The second key point is to approximate 
 using an approximate value λ of ε. We define a function q that seems to be close to 
 on the basis of its representation with ε and 
 for all 
. In contrast to Bremner et al.'s setting, we do not know ε. Thus, we define q using λ and an appropriate (polynomial) number of the low-degree Fourier coefficients. This number depends on λ, the constant α associated with the anti-concentration assumption, and the desired approximation accuracy. We then evaluate the approximation accuracy of q. Here, we need to care about the error caused by the difference between λ and ε. We upper-bound this error using the anti-concentration assumption.

To prove Theorem 2, we represent the effect of noise under noise model B as the effect of noise under noise model A with rate 
 and the remaining effects. We do this by transforming the representation of the probability distribution 
, which we want to approximate, with several basic properties of noise operators on real-valued functions over 
 [15]. The obtained representation means that, to sample 
, it suffices to sample the probability distribution 
 (resulting from p) under noise model A with rate 
 and then to classically simulate noise corresponding to the remaining effects. By Theorem 1, 
 is classically simulatable. Moreover, we can classically simulate noise corresponding to the remaining effects using the approximate values of 
 and the other noise rates.

2. Preliminaries
2.1. Quantum circuits and their output probability distributions
Pauli matrices X, Y, Z, and I are 
  
  
  
  The Hadamard operation H is . For any real number θ, the rotation operations 
 and 
 are  and , respectively, where 
 and 
 are denoted as T and S, respectively. It holds that 
. The controlled-Z operation CZ and the controlled-controlled-Z operation CCZ are  and , respectively, where the states |0〉 and |1〉 are ±1-eigenstates of Z, respectively. The operations H, S, and CZ are called Clifford operations.

A quantum circuit consists of elementary gates, each of which is in the gate set , where
 Each 
 has its inverse in  and so does 
. Moreover, each of the one-qubit operations X, Y, Z, and H can be decomposed into a constant number of 
's and 
's (up to an unimportant global phase). Similarly, CCZ can be decomposed into a constant number of 
's, 
's, and CZ's. Since the gate set  is approximately universal for quantum computation [13], so is . The complexity measures of a quantum circuit are its size and depth. The size is the number of elementary gates in the circuit. To define the depth, we regard the circuit as a set of layers  consisting of elementary gates, where gates in the same layer act on pairwise disjoint sets of qubits and any gate in layer j is applied before any gate in layer . The depth is the smallest possible value of d [8].

We deal with a uniform family of polynomial-size quantum circuits 
. Each 
 has n input qubits initialized to 
. After performing 
, we perform Z-basis measurements on all qubits. The output probability distribution p of 
 over 
 is defined as 
. A symbol denoting a quantum circuit also denotes its matrix representation in the Z basis. The uniformity means that the function 
 
 is computable by a polynomial-time classical Turing machine, where 
 
 is the classical description of 
 [14].

2.2. Fourier expansions and effects of noise
Let 
 be an arbitrary (real-valued) function. Then, f can be uniquely represented as an -linear combination of 
 basis functions 
 
 which is called the Fourier expansion of f [15]. Here, 
 is called the Fourier coefficient of f and the symbol “⋅” represents the inner product of two n-bit strings, i.e., 
 for any 
, 
. It holds that
 
 
 for any 
. The 
 norm of f is defined as
 
 where . It is known that 
 [15].

Let C be an arbitrary quantum circuit on n qubits and p be its output probability distribution over 
. We consider C under noise model A where a depolarizing channel 
 with rate  is applied to each qubit after performing C. Here, 
 
 for any density operator ρ of a qubit. We perform Z-basis measurements on all qubits and let 
 be the resulting probability distribution over 
. As shown in [6], we can sample 
 by sampling an n-bit string according to p and then flipping each bit of the string with probability . This implies the following Fourier expansion of 
 [15]:
 
 where 
 for any 
. We also consider C under noise model B where 
 with rate 
 is applied to the j-th qubit after performing C for any . We perform Z-basis measurements on all qubits and let 
 be the resulting probability distribution over 
. As with 
, we can sample 
 by sampling an n-bit string according to p and then flipping its j-th bit with probability 
 for any . The Fourier expansion of 
 is as follows [15]:
 
 

2.3. CT states and ECS operations
We first introduce computationally tractable (CT) states [20]:

Definition 1 CT states

Let  be an arbitrary (pure) quantum state on n qubits. Then,  is CT if the following items hold:

•
The probability distribution p over 
 defined as 
 is classically samplable in polynomial time.

•
For any 
,  is classically computable in polynomial time.1

An example of a CT state is a product state.
We then introduce the sparseness of a Hermitian operation and (a restricted version of) efficiently computable sparse (ECS) operations [20]:

Definition 2 Sparseness

Let W be an arbitrary Hermitian operation on n qubits. Then, W is sparse if there exists a polynomial s in n such that, for any 
,  is a linear combination of at most  computational basis states.

Definition 3 ECS operations

Let W be an arbitrary sparse operation (associated with s). Then, W is ECS if, for any 
 and , the functions 
 and 
 are classically computable in polynomial time, where we define 
 and 
 as follows: for any 
, if the j-th non-zero entry exists in the column of W indexed by x when traversing this column from top to bottom, 
 is this entry and 
 is the row index associated with 
. If the j-th non-zero entry does not exist, 
 and 
.

An ECS operation is called ECS1 if . Moreover, an ECS1 operation is called efficiently computable basis-preserving if it is unitary and .
An efficiently computable basis-preserving operation preserves the class of CT states as follows:

Theorem 3

Lemma 2 of [20]
Let  be an arbitrary CT state on n qubits and U be an arbitrary efficiently computable basis-preserving operation on n qubits. Then,  is CT.

The following theorem is a rephrased version of the one in [20]:
Theorem 4

Theorem 3 of [20]
Let U be an arbitrary unitary operation on n qubits such that 
 is CT, and O be an arbitrary observable (i.e., Hermitian operation) with , where  is the maximum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of O. Let V be an arbitrary unitary operation on n qubits such that 
 is ECS, and f be an arbitrary polynomial in n. Then, there exists a polynomial-time randomized algorithm which outputs a real number r such that
 
 

3. Target quantum circuits and associated Fourier coefficients
3.1. CT-ECS circuits
We focus on a new class of quantum circuits defined by CT states and ECS operations:

Definition 4 CT-ECS circuits

A quantum circuit C on n qubits initialized to 
 is CT-ECS if C consists of two blocks  such that U and V are polynomial-size quantum circuits, 
 is CT, and 
 is ECS for any , where 
 is a Pauli-Z operation on the j-th qubit. In particular, C is CT-ECS1 if C is CT-ECS and the operation 
 associated with C is ECS1 for any .

To give examples of CT-ECS circuits, we consider the following quantum circuits on n qubits:
•
An IQP circuit is of the form 
, where D is a polynomial-size quantum circuit consisting of Z, CZ, and CCZ gates [5].

•
A Clifford Magic circuit is of the form 
, where E is a polynomial-size Clifford circuit, which consists of H, S, and CZ gates [21].

•
A conjugated Clifford circuit is of the form 
 for arbitrary real numbers , where E is a polynomial-size Clifford circuit [3].

•
A constant-depth quantum circuit is a polynomial-size quantum circuit F whose depth is constant [19], [4], [2].

In the common definition of an IQP circuit, D consists of more general Z-diagonal gates. However, for simplicity, we adopt the above definition. The resulting class includes a quantum circuit of the form 
 such that its output probability distribution is anti-concentrated and not classically simulatable (under plausible assumptions).
We show that the above circuits are CT-ECS (in fact, CT-ECS1):

Lemma 1

Let C be one of the following quantum circuits on n qubits: an IQP, a Clifford Magic, a conjugated Clifford, or a constant-depth quantum circuit. Then, C is CT-ECS1.

Proof

When C is an IQP circuit, 
, where D is a polynomial-size quantum circuit consisting of Z, CZ, and CCZ gates. We consider 
 and 
. Since 
 is a product state and D is an efficiently computable basis-preserving operation, by Theorem 3, 
 is CT. Moreover, 
, which is obviously ECS1 (in fact, efficiently computable basis-preserving), where 
 is a Pauli-X operation on the j-th qubit. Thus, C is CT-ECS1.

When C is a Clifford Magic circuit, 
, where E is a polynomial-size Clifford circuit. We consider 
 and . Since 
 is a product state, it is CT. Moreover, since E is a Clifford circuit, 
 is a Pauli operation on n qubits, which is obviously ECS1 (in fact, efficiently computable basis-preserving). Thus, C is CT-ECS1.

When C is a conjugated Clifford circuit, 
 for arbitrary real numbers , where E is a polynomial-size Clifford circuit. We consider 
 and 
. Since 
 is a product state, it is CT. Moreover,
 The coefficients 
 satisfying the following relation are classically computable in constant time:
 This implies that 
. Since E is a Clifford circuit, the operations 
, 
, and 
 are Pauli operations on n qubits, which implies that 
 is ECS1. Thus, C is CT-ECS1.

When C is a constant-depth quantum circuit, we consider  and . Of course, 
 is CT. Moreover, since each elementary gate in this paper acts only on a constant number of qubits, 
 also acts only on a constant number of qubits, which implies that 
 is ECS1. Thus, C is CT-ECS1. □

Lemma 1 implies that there exist various CT-ECS circuits such that their output probability distributions are anti-concentrated and not classically simulatable (under plausible assumptions) [5], [21], [3], although we do not know whether the output probability distributions of constant-depth quantum circuits are anti-concentrated.
3.2. Approximating the associated Fourier coefficients
To approximate the Fourier coefficients associated with CT-ECS circuits, we provide a general relation between a quantum circuit and the Fourier coefficients of its output probability distribution:

Lemma 2

Let C be an arbitrary quantum circuit on n qubits initialized to 
 and p be its output probability distribution over 
. Then,
 
 for any 
, where 
, i.e., the tensor product of a Pauli-Z operation on the j-th qubit with 
 for any .

Proof

We transform the representation of the Fourier coefficient described in Section 2.2 as follows:(1)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 where 
 denotes 
 for any 
. Since it holds that
 
 
 the above representation (1) of 
 implies that
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 where  is the bit-wise addition of s and t modulo 2. This is the desired representation. □

Using Theorem 4 and Lemma 2, we show that the low-degree Fourier coefficients of the output probability distribution of a CT-ECS circuit can be approximated classically in polynomial time:

Lemma 3

Let C be an arbitrary CT-ECS circuit on n qubits and p be its output probability distribution over 
. Let f be an arbitrary polynomial in n and s be an arbitrary element of 
 with . Then, there exists a polynomial-time randomized algorithm which outputs a real number 
 such that
 
 

Proof

Since C is CT-ECS, it can be represented as  such that 
 is CT and 
 is ECS for any . Let s be an arbitrary element of 
 with , and we assume that 
 (and 
). In this case,
 
 Since 
 is ECS, 
 is the product of a constant number of ECS operations. A simple calculation shows that such a product is also ECS. Thus, 
 is ECS.

Since 
 is CT and 
, by Theorem 4, there exists a polynomial-time randomized algorithm which outputs a real number  such that
 
 
 By Lemma 2 with ,
 
 and thus the desired relation holds by defining 
. □

For any probability distribution p over 
, it holds that 
. Thus, when we consider a classical algorithm for approximating 
, we only consider an algorithm that outputs 
 when 
. This simplifies the analysis in the following sections.

4. CT-ECS circuits under noise model A
In this section, we prove Theorem 1. Its precise statement is as follows, where, throughout the paper, the base of the logarithm is 2:

Theorem 1

Let C be an arbitrary CT-ECS circuit on n qubits such that its output probability distribution p satisfies 
 for some known constant . Let  be an arbitrary constant. We assume that a depolarizing channel with (possibly unknown) constant rate  is applied to each qubit after performing C, which yields the probability distribution 
, and it is possible to choose a constant λ such that
 
 
 
 
 Then, there exists an 
 
 
-time randomized algorithm which outputs (a classical description of) a probability distribution 
 over 
 such that
 
 and 
 is classically samplable in time 
 
 
.

4.1. Proof of Theorem 1
We show that 
 can be approximated by a function whose Fourier coefficients can be obtained classically in polynomial time:

Lemma 4

Let C be an arbitrary CT-ECS circuit on n qubits such that its output probability distribution p satisfies 
 for some known constant . Let  be an arbitrary constant. We assume that a depolarizing channel with constant rate  is applied to each qubit after performing C, which yields the probability distribution 
, and it is possible to choose a constant λ such that
 
 
 
 
 Then, there exists an 
 
 
-time randomized algorithm which outputs the Fourier coefficients of a function q over 
 such that
 
 

Proof

As described in Section 2.2, the probability distribution 
 is represented as
 
 Using the known constants α, δ, and λ, we fix an integer constant
 
 
 Since  and , it holds that . The definition of c implies that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Thus, 
. Moreover, 
 
 since
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

By Lemma 3 with 
 and an arbitrary 
 with , there exists a polynomial-time randomized algorithm which outputs 
 such that
 
 
 The runtime of this algorithm can be represented as 
 
 
 since this algorithm is the 
 
 
 repetitions of polynomial-time classical algorithms that do not depend on the values α, δ, and λ. We compute 
 for all 
 with , and define 
 (as described at the end of Section 3) and 
 for all 
 with . Since 
, it takes 
 
 
-time to compute all these values. Moreover,
 
 
 This can be simply shown by a direct application of the inequality 
 for an arbitrary real number  and integer .

We define a function q over 
 as 
 
 In the following, we show that 
 under the assumption that, for all 
 with , 
 
. A direct calculation with the relations described in Section 2.2 shows that(2)
 
 
 Using the bounds 
 and 
, we upper-bound the first term of (2) as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Then, we upper-bound the second term of (2) as follows:(3)
 
 
 
 
 
 where the last inequality is due to the fact that
 and 
 
, where 
.

Using the bounds 
 
, 
, 
, and 
, we upper-bound the value (3) as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Combining the upper bounds of the above two terms implies that
 
 
 
 which is the desired bound. □

The remaining problem is to sample a probability distribution close to the function q. To do this, we use a classical sampling algorithm proposed by Bremner et al. [6], although the following analysis is slightly simpler than theirs. We can represent q as 
 
 where 
. It holds that 
. We define 
 and
  for any  and 
, where ∅ denotes the empty string. The sampling algorithm is described as follows:

, where 
.

(b)
Otherwise, set  with probability 
 and  with probability

A direct calculation shows that
 
 for any  and 
. Since 
 is classically computable in time 
 
 
 (when we have 
 for all 
 with ), the runtime of the sampling algorithm is 
 
 
. This sampling algorithm defines a real-valued function, denoted as , that maps 
 to the probability that the sampling algorithm outputs y.
Bremner et al. [6] defined 
 and showed that
  and  is a probability distribution. Since 
, we can deal with the situation where . Therefore, Bremner et al.'s analysis of  directly works for . This allows us to show the following lemma, which is a special case of the property of  shown by Bremner et al. [6]:

Lemma 5

We assume that there exists a constant  such that 
. Then, 
.

Proof

We upper-bound the value 
 as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 which is the desired upper bound. □

The above lemmas immediately imply Theorem 1:

Proof of Theorem 1

By Lemma 4, there exists an 
 
 
-time randomized algorithm which outputs the Fourier coefficients of a function q over 
 such that
 
 
 We define 
. By Lemma 5, when 
, it holds that
 By the sampling algorithm described above, 
 is classically samplable in time 
 
 
. □

4.2. Input-noise model and noise-free setting
We first deal with an input-noise model where 
 is applied to each qubit (initialized to |0〉) only at the start of computation, and consider IQP circuits under this input-noise model as depicted in Fig. 2(a). We show that, when noise model A is replaced with this input-noise model, Theorem 1 holds for IQP circuits. Let 
 be an arbitrary IQP circuit on n qubits, where D consists of Z, CZ, and CCZ gates. Let 
 be the resulting probability distribution over 
. The input state 
 affected by noise is
 
 
 
 
 
 A direct calculation shows that 
, where 
 is the output probability distribution of C under noise model A with rate ε. This is because 
 for any 
. Thus, when the output probability distribution of C is anti-concentrated, 
 is classically simulatable by Theorem 1, and so is 
. A similar proof shows that, when noise model B is replaced with the input-noise model, Theorem 2 holds for IQP circuits.

We then consider CT-ECS circuits in the noise-free setting as depicted in Fig. 2(b), and show that, when only  qubits are measured, any quantum circuit in a class of CT-ECS circuits on n qubits is classically simulatable. Let  be an arbitrary CT-ECS circuit on n qubits and p be its output probability distribution over 
. We can represent p as 
 
 As with Lemma 2,

We assume that

. In this case, as in the proof of Lemma 3, all the Fourier coefficients can be approximated classically in polynomial time with polynomial accuracy. Then, we define a function q over 
 as 
 
 where 
 is the approximate value of

 and 
. Since 
 is upper-bounded by some inverse polynomial in n, the classical sampling algorithm in Section 4.1 implies that p is classically simulatable, i.e., can be approximated by a classically samplable probability distribution, which is , with polynomial accuracy in 
 norm. For example, we consider a CT-ECS1 circuit, which is a CT-ECS circuit such that the associated ECS operation 
 is ECS1 for any . In this case, 
 is ECS for all 
, since it is the product of at most m ECS1 (not ECS) operations. Thus, when only  qubits are measured, any CT-ECS1 circuit on n qubits is classically simulatable in the noise-free setting.

5. CT-ECS circuits under noise model B
In this section, we prove Theorem 2. Its precise statement is as follows:

Theorem 2

Let C be an arbitrary CT-ECS circuit on n qubits such that its output probability distribution p satisfies 
 for some known constant . Let  be an arbitrary constant. We assume that a depolarizing channel with (possibly unknown) constant rate 
 is applied to the j-th qubit after performing C for any , which yields the probability distribution 
. Moreover, we assume that it is possible to choose a constant 
 such that
 
 
 
 
 where 
, and it is possible to choose a constant 
 such that
 
 
 
 for any  with 
, where all numbers j with 
 are known. Then, there exists an 
 
 
-time randomized algorithm which outputs (a classical description of) a probability distribution 
 over 
 such that
 
 
 and 
 is classically samplable in time 
 
 
.

Although the approximation accuracy of 
 depends on 
, a typical situation might be when 
 is not so large. For example, when 
, it holds that 
 (with high probability).
We represent the effect of noise under noise model B as the effect under noise model A with rate 
 and the remaining effects. To do this, for any  and 
, we consider the noise operator 
 on real-valued functions over 
 [15] defined as
 
 Here, 
 means that 
 is drawn as follows:

 with probability 
 and 
 with probability 
. Let p be an arbitrary probability distribution over 
. It holds that 
 is equal to the probability of obtaining x by sampling an n-bit string according to p and then flipping its j-th bit with probability 
 for any . Thus, the representation of 
 described in Section 2.2 is obtained as 
. It is known that 
 is a contraction operator, i.e., 
 for any real-valued function f over 
 [15].

Lemma 4 with these basic facts on the noise operator implies the following lemma on the representation of 
 and its approximability:

Lemma 6

Let C be an arbitrary CT-ECS circuit on n qubits such that its output probability distribution p satisfies 
 for some known constant . Let  be an arbitrary constant. We assume that a depolarizing channel with constant rate 
 is applied to the j-th qubit after performing C for any , which yields the probability distribution 
, and it is possible to choose a constant 
 such that
 
 
 
 
 where 
. Then, the following items hold:

(i)
, where
 
 

(ii)
There exists an 
 
 
-time randomized algorithm which outputs the Fourier coefficients of a function q over 
 such that
 
 

(iii)
Let 
 be an arbitrary constant for any . We assume that there exists a constant  such that 
 for any . Then,
 
 where 
 
 
.

Proof

(i): As described above, the probability distribution 
 is represented as
 
 
 We can transform this representation of 
 as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 which is the desired representation.

(ii): The probability distribution 
 can be regarded as the output probability distribution of C under noise model A with rate 
. Since we have an approximate value 
 of 
, we can apply the proof of Lemma 4. More concretely, we define
 
 
 Since 
 and , it holds that . We can obtain 
 for all 
 with  such that
 
 
 where 
. It takes 
 
 
-time to obtain all these values. We define 
, which is equal to 
, and 
 for all 
 with . It holds that
 
 
 Moreover, we define a function q over 
 as 
 
 and it holds that 
 under the assumption that, for all 
 with , 
 
.

(iii): The function 
 over 
 can be represented as
 
 
 where 
. Since 
 can be represented similarly,
 
 
 
 This representation with the relation described in Section 2.2 implies that(4)
 
 
 
 A simple calculation shows that, for any 
 with 
 (and 
),
 
 
 
 
 
 Combining this with the inequality (4) and the assumption that 
 for any , it holds that
 
 

The remaining problem is to show that 
 under the assumption that, for all 
 with , 
 
. This can be done by using the bounds 
, 
, and 
 as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 which is the desired bound. □

Lemma 6 implies Theorem 2:

Proof of Theorem 2

Using the function q obtained by Lemma 6, we define 
 and 
, where
 
 for any  with 
 and 
 for any other j. In the following, we assume that, for all 
 with , 
 
. In this case, 
. Thus, 
 by the proof of Lemma 5. This implies that(5)
 where the second inequality is due to the fact that the noise operator is a contraction operator as described before Lemma 6.

It is obvious that 
 for any  with 
. We show that
 
 
 
 for any  with 
. In fact,

 and 
 
 
 
 as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 On the other hand, 
 is lower-bounded by using the bounds 
 
 
 
 and 
 as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

By the definition of c, it holds that 
 
 
. Thus, the above upper bound of 
 implies that
 
 
 
 
 
 for any . By Lemma 6 with 
 
 
,
 
 
 
 since  and . This bound with the inequality (5) implies that
 
 

The above analysis means that, to simulate 
, it suffices to sample 
, i.e., to sample an n-bit string according to 
 and flip its j-th bit using a biased coin with probability
 
 
 
 
 of heads for any  with 
. By the sampling algorithm described in Section 4.1, 
 is classically samplable in time 
 
 
. Thus, 
 is also classically samplable in time 
 
 
. We note that, although it may not be possible to flip such a biased coin with perfect accuracy, it suffices to flip a biased coin whose probability of heads is exponentially close to that of the above coin by computing the value 
 
 with exponential accuracy. □

6. Conclusions and future work
We considered the effect of noise on the classical simulatability of CT-ECS circuits, such as IQP, Clifford Magic, conjugated Clifford, and constant-depth quantum circuits. We showed that, under noise model A, if an approximate value of the noise rate is known, any CT-ECS circuit with an anti-concentrated output probability distribution is classically simulatable. This indicates that the presence of small noise drastically affects the classical simulatability of CT-ECS circuits. We also considered noise model B where the noise rate can vary with each qubit, and provided a similar sufficient condition for classically simulating CT-ECS circuits with anti-concentrated output probability distributions.

Interesting challenges would be to investigate the effect of noise on the classical simulatability of other quantum circuits that are not classically simulatable in the noise-free setting (under plausible assumptions), such as a quantum circuit for Shor's factoring algorithm [17]. At present, it seems difficult to apply our analysis directly to such a circuit based on the quantum Fourier transform. However, there exists a classical algorithm for simulating such a circuit with a sparse output probability distribution in the noise-free setting [16], and this algorithm might be useful in a noise setting. It would also be interesting to investigate fault-tolerant schemes to protect CT-ECS circuits from noise. As described in [6], a simple repetition code can be used to protect IQP circuits under noise model A with a known rate, and the circuits produced by using the error-correcting code are also IQP circuits. Similarly, the simple repetition code can be used for CT-ECS circuits under noise model A with a known rate. However, the produced circuits are in general completely different from the original ones. This would decrease the possibility of implementing such circuits, and thus it would be interesting to study how to avoid this problem.
