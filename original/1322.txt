Motivated by the connectivity problem in wireless networks with directional antennas, we study bounded-angle spanning trees. Let P be a set of points in the plane and let 𝛼 be an angle. An 𝛼-ST of P is a spanning tree of the complete Euclidean graph on P with the property that all edges incident to each point 𝑝∈𝑃 lie in a wedge of angle 𝛼 centered at p. We study the following closely related problems for 𝛼=2𝜋/3 (however, our approximation ratios hold for any 𝛼⩾2𝜋/3).

1.
The 𝛼-minimum spanning tree problem asks for an 𝛼-ST of minimum sum of edge lengths. Among many interesting results, Aschner and Katz (ICALP 2014) proved the NP-hardness of this problem and presented a 6-approximation algorithm. Their algorithm finds an 𝛼-ST of length at most 6 times the length of the minimum spanning tree (MST). By adapting a somewhat similar approach and using different proof techniques we improve this ratio to 16/3.

2.
To examine what is possible with non-uniform wedge angles, we define an 𝛼⎯⎯⎯-ST to be a spanning tree with the property that incident edges to all points lie in wedges of average angle 𝛼. We present an algorithm to find an 𝛼⎯⎯⎯-ST whose largest edge-length and sum of edge lengths are at most 2 and 1.5 times (respectively) those of the MST. These ratios are better than any achievable when all wedges have angle 𝛼. Our algorithm runs in linear time after computing the MST.

Introduction
A wireless network can be represented by disks in the plane, where a wireless node at point p with transmission range r is represented by a disk of radius r centered at point p. An edge of the network connects two nodes if each one is inside the disk centered at the other one. The question of assigning transmission ranges to the nodes to ensure a well-connected network of low interference has been widely studied [5, 8, 14, 17, 19, 20, 24, 27]. If different nodes may have different transmission ranges then we obtain “power assignment” problems, which have also been heavily studied, see e.g. [6, 12, 13, 28, 31, 33]. The minimum transmission range to ensure network connectivity is the bottleneck of the minimum Bottleneck Spanning Tree (BST)—equivalently, the maximum edge-length in a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).

In recent years, the idea of replacing omni-directional antennas with directional antennas has received considerable attention (see, e.g., [1, 4, 10, 15, 16, 18, 19, 29]). In this model, the full disk at each point p is restricted to a circular wedge with apex p that has some angle 𝛼 and is oriented in some direction. Directional antennas are desirable in many ways, for example, they require lower transmission power, cause less interference, and provide more secure communication (see [5, 29] and references therein). The symmetric communication network [5] has an edge between two nodes if each one is inside the other’s wedge.

When every node has the same transmission range r and angle 𝛼, there is still freedom to orient the directional antennas. The question of whether r and 𝛼 permit a connected network is NP-hard (see Sect. 1.2 for details). Most previous work has concentrated on the case where 𝛼 is some fixed value. Aschner and Katz [4] formulated this in terms of an 𝛼-Spanning Tree (𝛼-ST): a spanning tree of the complete Euclidean graph on a point set P in the plane such that for each point 𝑝∈𝑃 all the edges incident to p lie in a wedge of angle 𝛼 centered at p (see Fig. 1-left). For any 𝛼<𝜋/3, an 𝛼-ST may not exist, for example, if P is the set of vertices of an equilateral triangle. However, for any 𝛼⩾𝜋/3, an 𝛼-ST always exists (see [1, 2], and [16] for three different proofs). There is a relationship between 𝛼-STs and the well-studied concept of restricted degree spanning trees, since d edges at a vertex always lie in some wedge of angle at most 2𝜋(1−1/𝑑).

To evaluate edge lengths of 𝛼-STs two concepts are useful. An 𝛼-Bottleneck Spanning Tree (𝛼-BST) is an 𝛼-ST that minimizes the maximum edge length, and an 𝛼-Minimum Spanning Tree (𝛼-MST) is an 𝛼-ST that minimizes the sum of the edge lengths. Both are NP-hard to compute. Although any MST is also a BST [14], this is not necessarily true for 𝛼-MST and 𝛼-BST—we give an example in the proof of Proposition 3. For 𝛼⩾2𝜋/3 Aschner and Katz [4, 26] gave a simple polynomial time 5-approximation algorithm for the 𝛼-BST.

The main result of Aschner and Katz [4] is a 6-approximation algorithm for the 𝛼-MST for 𝛼⩾2𝜋/3. In particular, they construct an 𝛼-ST of length at most 6 times the length of an MST of the points. Our main technical result is to improve this approximation factor to 16/3. An interesting aspect of their proof is that they orient the wedges at small subsets of the points so that the network on these points is connected and the wedges cover the whole plane. The problem of orienting wedges at fixed points to cover (or “light up”) the plane is called the “Floodlight Problem”. Bose et al. [11] showed that for any n points and any set {𝛼1,…,𝛼𝑛} of angles that are at most 𝜋 and sum to 2𝜋, there is a way to assign angles to points and orient the wedges to light up the plane. To obtain our main result, we prove a strengthened version of the Floodlight result for 𝑛=3 where we obtain a connected symmetric communication network even if the angles are pre-assigned to the points.

The new problem we study in this paper is the directional antenna problem when different nodes are allowed to have different wedge angles. The goal is to minimize the sum of the angles. For consistency with previous notation, we define an 𝛼⎯⎯⎯-ST to be a spanning tree of the point set P such that for each point 𝑝∈𝑃 all the edges incident to p lie in a wedge of angle 𝛼𝑝 centered at p and the average of the 𝛼𝑝’s is 𝛼, or in other words, ∑𝑝𝛼𝑝=𝑛𝛼. One might hope that, as with the Floodlight Problem, a constant angle sum would suffice to construct a good network. Indeed, taking a star as a spanning tree achieves constant angle sum (with 𝜋 at an extreme point taken as the center, and 0 at the leaves of the star)—but this uses a large transmission range. We show that it is not possible in general to achieve constant angle sum and transmission ranges bounded by a constant times the BST bottleneck.

In the positive direction, we show that allocating an angle sum of 𝑛⋅2𝜋/3 non-uniformly does help, in particular, we can achieve smaller maximum edge-length and sum of edge lengths (compared to the MST) than is possible with uniform angles. Now we give more details about our results and techniques, and more details on background.

Our Results
We obtain the following results for angle 𝛼=2𝜋/3, however, our approximation ratios hold for any angle 𝛼⩾2𝜋/3.

(1) Aschner and Katz [4] gave an elegant algorithm that finds a 2𝜋/3-ST of length at most 6 times the MST length, thus providing a 6-approximation algorithm for the 2𝜋/3-MST. Our main technical result (Theorem 1 in Sect. 3) is to improve the approximation ratio to 16/3.

Aschner and Katz prove their result using (in their words) a “surprising theorem”, proved via a long case-analysis, that there is a way to assign 2𝜋/3 wedges to any 3 points (a “triplet”) such that: the union of the 3 wedges covers the plane; the resulting graph on the triplet is connected; and the resulting graph on any pair of triplets (whose wedges are assigned independently) is also connected. After that, their approach is to take an MST of the points, double its edges and take short-cuts to obtain a Hamiltonian path of length at most 2 times the MST length (as in the standard TSP approximation), and then apply their result to successive triplets of points on the path. Their theorem guarantees that successive pairs of triplets are connected. Finally, they get an approximation factor of 6 using the triangle inequality, and a judicious choice of whether to start the partition into triplets at the first, second, or third point of the path. One limitation of their approach is that the two edges used in each triplet may be the longest and second longest edges of the triplet.

We follow the same approach. We take a non-crossing Hamiltonian path and consider successive triplets of points along the path. The fact that edges of the Hamiltonian path are non-crossing ensures that the triplets are also “non-crossing” in some sense. This allows us to assign wedges to the triplets in a different way leading to a shorter proof of the “surprising theorem” for non-crossing triplets, as well as a better length guarantee within each triplet.

Our algorithm is slower than that of Aschner and Katz because of the extra work of uncrossing the edges of the Hamiltonian path.

Note. After the initial submission of this paper, there has been further improvement on the approximation ratio. In WADS 2021, Ashur and Katz [7] showed how to construct a 2𝜋/3-ST of length at most 4 times the MST length. The general approach is to partition the vertices of the Hamiltonian path into pairs and then orient the pairs (not independently of each other) in such a way that there is a connection between consecutive pairs.

(2) We give an algorithm to find a 2𝜋/3⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯-ST whose largest edge-length is at most 2 times the largest edge-length of the MST, and whose sum of edge lengths is at most 1.5 times the length of the MST (Theorem 6 in Sect. 4). The idea of our algorithm is to start with an MST that has maximum degree 5 (which is known to exist) and then re-assign parts of the wedge angles from leaves to inner vertices. Our algorithm runs in linear time after computation of the MST. The ratios 2 and 1.5 improve the best known ratios for 2𝜋/3-BST and 2𝜋/3-MST (5 and 16/3, respectively). In fact, our ratios for non-uniform angles are better than any possible with uniform angles, as we prove by designing an infinite class of point sets such that every 2𝜋/3-ST has maximum edge length at least 3 times the largest edge-length of the MST, and sum of edge lengths at least 2 times the length of the MST.

(3) We present the following lower bounds for approximating the above problems with respect to the MST. These bounds are proved in Sect. 2. Although the lower bounds of 2 and 3 (in Proposition 1) for the 2𝜋/3-MST and the 2𝜋/3-BST seem to be common knowledge [4, 26], for the sake of completeness we give a proof of them. Proposition 1 gives the lower bound 4/3 for the 2𝜋/3⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯-ST.

Proposition 1
Let 𝛼 and 𝛼⎯⎯⎯ be two angles in the open interval (0,𝜋). The 𝛼-MST, the 𝛼⎯⎯⎯-MST, and the 𝛼-BST problems cannot be approximated by ratios smaller than 2, 2−𝛼⎯⎯⎯/𝜋, and 3, respectively, given the length of the MST and the largest edge-length of the MST as lower bounds.

Proposition 2
Let A(n) be the smallest value that suffices to construct, for any set of n points in the plane, a connected symmetric network with angle sum A(n) and with transmission ranges bounded by a constant times the largest edge-length of the BST. Then 𝐴(𝑛)∈𝛺(𝑛√).

Proposition 3
For any 𝛼<𝜋 there exists a point set for which no 𝛼-MST is an 𝛼-BST.

Further Background
As mentioned above, there is a connection between 𝛼-STs and restricted degree spanning trees, due to the fact that d edges at a vertex always lie in some wedge of angle at most 2𝜋(1−1/𝑑). The Minimum degree-k spanning tree (degree-k MST) problem has been well-studied (see, e.g., [3, 17, 25, 27]). It is easy to compute a degree-2 spanning tree (a Hamiltonian path) of length at most twice the length of the Euclidean MST by doubling the MST edges, taking an Euler tour, short-cutting repeated vertices, and then removing an edge. It is also possible to compute in polynomial time degree-3, degree-4, and degree-5 spanning trees of lengths at most 1.402 [17], 1.1381 [17, 25], and 1 [30] times the MST length, respectively. This immediately implies the existence of 𝜋-ST, 4𝜋/3-ST, 3𝜋/2-ST, and 8𝜋/5-ST of lengths at most 2, 1.402, 1.1381, and 1 times the MST length, respectively. See Fig. 1-right for an illustration of a degree-5 MST which is a 8𝜋/5-ST.

The 𝛼-MST problem is also related to the problem of computing angle-restricted Hamiltonian paths and cycles on points in the plane. One can compute a Hamiltonian path with angles of at most 𝜋/2 by starting from an arbitrary point and iteratively connecting the current point to its farthest among the remaining points (see [23]); the angle 𝜋/2 is tight in the sense that there are point sets for which every Hamiltonian path has an angle larger than 𝜋/2−𝜀 for any 𝜀>0 (see [16, 21]). Fekete and Woeginger [23] conjectured that for any even-size point set of at least 8 elements there exists a Hamiltonian cycle with angles at most 𝜋/2. Dumitrescu et al. [21] gave a partial solution by constructing a cycle with angles of at most 2𝜋/3. The conjecture remains open.

Aschner and Katz [4] studied the 𝛼-MST problem for 𝛼∈{𝜋/2,2𝜋/3,𝜋}. They proved the NP-hardness of this problem for 𝛼=2𝜋/3 and 𝛼=𝜋 by reductions from the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path in hexagonal grid graphs and in square grid graphs of degree at most three, respectively. In addition to the result mentioned above for a 2𝜋/3-ST of length at most 6 times the MST length, they also presented an algorithm for computing a 𝜋/2-ST of length at most 16 times the MST length.

The problem of constructing bounded-angle networks with no long edges (the 𝛼-BST problem) has been studied extensively. The NP-hardness reduction of Aschner and Katz for the 2𝜋/3-MST problem also implies the NP-hardness of the 2𝜋/3-BST problem and its inapproximability by a factor smaller than 3‾√. Carmi et al. [16] construct 𝜋/2-Hamiltonian paths with edges that are shorter than that of the construction by Fekete and Woeginger [23]. Aschner and Katz [4] construct 2𝜋/3-hop-spanners with hop-ratio 6 and edge lengths at most 7 for unit disk graphs. Dobrev et al. [19, 20] and Caragiannis et al. [15] construct strongly connected directed networks with short edges and nodes of bounded out-degree.

Notation and Preliminaries
Let 𝑤𝑝 be a wedge in the plane with apex p. We denote by 𝑤𝑝−→ the clockwise (right) boundary ray of 𝑤𝑝, and by 𝑤𝑝←− the counterclockwise (left) boundary ray of 𝑤𝑝. Let 𝑤𝑞 be another convex wedge in the plane with apex q. If q lies in 𝑤𝑝 then we say that p sees q and denote this by 𝑝→𝑞. We use 𝑝↔𝑞 to denote that p and q are mutually visible, that is, p and q see each other. In other words, 𝑝↔𝑞 denotes 𝑝→𝑞 and 𝑞→𝑝. In Fig. 2 the point p sees q but q does not see p, and thus they are not mutually visible. Let P be a set of points in the plane and assume that wedges, possibly of different angles, are placed at every point of P. Then the induced mutual-visibility graph on P is a geometric graph with vertex set P that has a straight-line edge between two points p and q if and only if p and q are mutually visible. The underlying non-geometric graph is the symmetric communication network on P.

We denote the sum of edge lengths of a geometric graph G by w(G). We need the following basic fact about triangles in the plane.

Lemma 1
Let a, b, and c be three points in the plane. The total length of the shortest and the longest sides of the triangle △(𝑎,𝑏,𝑐) is at most 1.5 times the total length of the two shortest sides.

Proof
After a suitable relabeling we may assume that |𝑎𝑏|⩽|𝑎𝑐|⩽|𝑏𝑐|. By the triangle inequality we have |𝑏𝑐|⩽(|𝑎𝑏|+|𝑎𝑐|), and by our assumption that |𝑎𝑏|⩽|𝑎𝑐| we have |𝑎𝑏|⩽0.5(|𝑎𝑏|+|𝑎𝑐|). The sum of these two new inequalities yields |𝑎𝑏|+|𝑏𝑐|⩽1.5(|𝑎𝑏|+|𝑎𝑐|), which proves the lemma. ◻

Lower Bounds
In this section we prove Propositions 1, 2, and 3.

Proposition 1Let 𝛼 and 𝛼⎯⎯⎯ be two angles in the open interval (0,𝜋). The 𝛼-MST, the 𝛼⎯⎯⎯-MST, and the 𝛼-BST problems cannot be approximated by ratios smaller than 2, 2−𝛼⎯⎯⎯/𝜋, and 3, respectively, given the length of the MST and the largest edge-length of the MST as lower bounds.

Proof
Consider a sequence 𝑋=(𝑥1,𝑥2,…,𝑥𝑛) of n points on the x-axis with coordinates 1,2,…,𝑛, respectively, as in Fig. 3. We show that X satisfies the statement of the proposition for the three problems. The MST of X is a path with edges of length 1 and total length 𝑛−1.

First we prove the lower bound 2 for the 2𝜋/3-MST problem (this lower bound is also mentioned in [4]). We show by induction that any 2𝜋/3-minimum spanning tree T on X has length at least 2𝑛−3. This is trivial if 𝑛∈{1,2}, thus assume that 𝑛⩾3. There are 𝑛−1 intervals on the x-axis between consecutive points of X. If every interval is covered by two edges of T then 𝑤(𝑇)⩾2𝑛−2. Assume that some interval [𝑖,𝑖+1] is covered by only one edge of T, say edge e. By removing e we obtain two subtrees 𝑇1 and 𝑇2 where 𝑇1 spans the points 𝑥1,…,𝑥𝑖 while 𝑇2 spans 𝑥𝑖+1,…,𝑥𝑛. Let 𝑛1 and 𝑛2 be the number vertices of 𝑇1 and 𝑇2, respectively. Assume that both 𝑛1 and 𝑛2 are at least 2. Since 𝑇1 spans 𝑥1,…,𝑥𝑖, the vertex 𝑥𝑖 is oriented to the left (and does not see any point to its right). Analogously, 𝑥𝑖+1 is oriented to the right. Therefore e is not incident to 𝑥𝑖 or 𝑥𝑖+1, and thus its length is at least 3. By the induction hypothesis we get 𝑤(𝑇)=𝑤(𝑇1)+𝑤(𝑇2)+𝑤(𝑒)⩾(2𝑛1−3)+(2𝑛2−3)+3=2(𝑛1+𝑛2)−3=2𝑛−3. Now assume that 𝑛1=1, and thus 𝑛2⩾2. Then 𝑇1 has only vertex 𝑥𝑖=𝑥1 which is an endpoint of e. Since 𝑇2 spans 𝑥2,…,𝑥𝑛, the vertex 𝑥2 is oriented to the right. Therefore e is not incident to 𝑥2, and thus its length is at least 2. Thus 𝑤(𝑇)=𝑤(𝑇1)+𝑤(𝑇2)+𝑤(𝑒)⩾0+(2𝑛2−3)+2=2𝑛−3. The case where 𝑛2=1 is handled similarly.

To verify the lower bound of 3 for the 2𝜋/3-BST problem, assume that 𝑛=5. Consider the edge-maximal graph on X that has edges of length at most 2. In any spanning tree in this graph, at least one of 𝑥2,𝑥3,𝑥4 has incident edges in both directions (left and right). Thus, no matter how we place wedges of angle 2𝜋/3 on vertices of X, we cannot get a 2𝜋/3-ST of edge lengths at most 2. Therefore, any 2𝜋/3-ST on X has an edge of length at least 3, as in Fig. 3a. This argument can be generalized for any n larger than 5.

Now consider any 2𝜋/3⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯-minimum spanning tree 𝑇⎯⎯⎯⎯ on X. We show that 𝑤(𝑇⎯⎯⎯⎯)⩾4𝑛/3−3. Partition the vertices of 𝑇⎯⎯⎯⎯ into 𝑋1 and 𝑋2 where 𝑋1 is the set of vertices with wedges of angle strictly less than 𝜋 and 𝑋2 is the set of vertices with wedges of angle at least 𝜋. Since the total available angle is 𝑛⋅2𝜋/3 radians, |𝑋2|⩽(𝑛⋅2𝜋/3)/𝜋=2𝑛/3. Thus |𝑋1|=𝑛−|𝑋2|⩾𝑛/3. Observe that every interval (between consecutive vertices of X) is covered by an edge of 𝑇⎯⎯⎯⎯. Every vertex 𝑥𝑖∈𝑋1 sees the vertices that are either to its left or to its right. We denote 𝑥𝑖 by 𝑥𝑖← if it sees the vertices to its left, and by 𝑥𝑖→ otherwise (see Fig. 3b). For every 𝑥𝑖← the interval [𝑖−1,𝑖] is covered by at least two edges otherwise connectivity is lost: one edge is incident to 𝑥𝑖← and another edge connects a point to the left of 𝑥𝑖← with a point to the right (assuming 𝑖≠𝑛). Similarly for every 𝑥𝑖→ the interval [𝑖,𝑖+1] is covered by an edge that is incident to 𝑥𝑖→ and by an edge that connects a point to the right of 𝑥𝑖→ with a point to the left (assuming 𝑖≠1), as in Fig. 3b. Thus, for every 𝑥𝑖← (except possibly 𝑥𝑛←−) there exists a unique interval that is covered by two edges of 𝑇⎯⎯⎯⎯. Similarly, for every 𝑥𝑖→ (except possibly 𝑥1−→) there exists a unique interval that is covered by two edges of 𝑇⎯⎯⎯⎯. (If 𝑥𝑖 is oriented to the left and 𝑥𝑖+1 is oriented to the right then—by the minimality of the tree—(𝑥𝑖,𝑥𝑖+1) is an edge of 𝑇⎯⎯⎯⎯ and the interval [𝑖,𝑖+1] is covered by three edges.) Therefore the length of 𝑇⎯⎯⎯⎯ is at least (𝑛−1)+(|𝑋1|−2)⩾4𝑛/3−3. ◻

Proposition 2Let A(n) be the smallest value that suffices to construct, for any set of n points in the plane, a connected symmetric network with angle sum A(n) and with transmission ranges bounded by a constant times the largest edge-length of the BST. Then 𝐴(𝑛)∈𝛺(𝑛√).

Proof
Consider a set of n points on the vertices of a regular 𝑛√×𝑛√ grid of side length 𝑛√−1. The largest edge-length of any BST for this point set is 1. Now consider any connected symmetric network T for this point set that satisfies the statement of the proposition, and let the constant c be the largest transmission range (edge-length) in T. Let L denote the set of supporting lines for all edges of T. Since any line in the plane contains at most 𝑛√ points of the grid, the cardinality of L is at least 𝑛√. This and the connectivity of T imply that T has at least one vertex, say v, where the neighbors of v lie on more than one line of L. Let V be the set of all such vertices of T. Observe that every line in L passes through a vertex in V. For every 𝑣∈𝑉 the neighbors of v lie in a square of side-length 2c that is centered at v. This square contains at most (2𝑐+1)2 grid points, and thus v has at most (2𝑐+1)2 neighbors (that can lie on at most (2𝑐+1)2 lines in L). Therefore |𝑉|⩾|𝐿|/(2𝑐+1)2⩾𝑛√/(2𝑐+1)2.

Now consider any 𝑣∈𝑉. Let 𝑣1 and 𝑣2 be two neighbors of v such that edges (𝑣,𝑣1)∈𝑇 and (𝑣,𝑣2)∈𝑇 lie on two different lines of L. Since v, 𝑣1, and 𝑣2 are grid points and lie on a square of constant side-length 2c, the angle between 𝑣1 and 𝑣2 at v is a constant. Let 𝛼 be the smallest such constant over all vertices in V. Then, the total angle at vertices in V is at least 𝛼⋅|𝑉|⩾𝛼𝑛√/(2𝑐+1)2∈𝛺(𝑛√). ◻

Proposition 3For any 𝛼<𝜋 there exists a point set for which no 𝛼-MST is an 𝛼-BST.

Proof
Consider the point set P in Fig. 4 consisting of 𝑛⩾9 points partitioned into 𝑡=𝑛/3 triplets (𝑎𝑖,𝑏𝑖,𝑐𝑖) where |𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑖+1|=1 and |𝑎𝑖𝑏𝑖|=|𝑏𝑖𝑐𝑖|=𝜖 for some 𝜖<1/(2𝑛−3). We refer to an edge of length at least 1 as a long edge. The red bold tree is an 𝛼-ST of total length (𝑡−1)((1+3𝜖)+2𝜖+𝜖)+2𝜖+𝜖=(𝑡−1)+(6𝑡−3)𝜖<𝑡, where the last inequality holds by our choice of 𝜖. Therefore any 𝛼-MST for P has at most 𝑡−1 long edges because otherwise it would have a length larger than t. This implies that each interval [𝑐𝑖,𝑎𝑖+1] is covered by at most 1 edge of any 𝛼-MST. On the other hand, any spanning tree for P has at least 𝑡−1 long edges as all triplet should be connected to the rest of the tree by a long tree edge. It turns out that any 𝛼-MST T of P has exactly 𝑡−1 long edges each connecting a point in triplet (𝑎𝑖,𝑏𝑖,𝑐𝑖) to a point in triplet (𝑎𝑖+1,𝑏𝑖+1,𝑐𝑖+1). In the rest of the proof we show that T has an edge of length at least 1+3𝜖. This immediately proves our claim because P admits an 𝛼-ST of edge lengths at most 1+2𝜖, see for example the thin blue tree in Fig. 4.

The red bold spanning tree has a total length of less than t. The blue thin spanning tree has edges of lengths at most 1+2𝜖

Consider any 𝑖∈{1,…,𝑡−1}. Let 𝑒𝑖 be the long edge of T between triplets (𝑎𝑖,𝑏𝑖,𝑐𝑖) and (𝑎𝑖+1,𝑏𝑖+1,𝑐𝑖+1). The point 𝑐𝑖 cannot be an endpoint of 𝑒𝑖 because otherwise there must be a long edge 𝑒′𝑖 in T that connects a point to the left of 𝑐𝑖 to a point to the right of 𝑐𝑖; this contradicts the fact that the interval [𝑐𝑖,𝑎𝑖+1] is covered by exactly one edge of T (by the constraint on the angle, 𝑐𝑖 cannot be connected to any point to the left). By symmetry, 𝑎𝑖+1 cannot be an endpoint of 𝑒𝑖 either. If 𝑎𝑖 or 𝑐𝑖+1 is an endpoint of 𝑒𝑖 then |𝑒𝑖|⩾1+3𝜖 and we are done. Assume that for every 𝑖∈{1,…,𝑡−1} we have 𝑒𝑖=(𝑏𝑖,𝑏𝑖+1). Then (𝑏1,𝑏2) and (𝑏2,𝑏3) are edges of T. Thus the angle at 𝑏2 is larger than 𝛼 which contradicts T being an 𝛼-ST. ◻

Approximating the 2𝜋/3-MST
Let 𝛼=2𝜋/3 in this section. Let P be a set of points in the plane. Aschner and Katz [4] showed how to construct an 𝛼-ST on P of length at most 6 times the MST length. In this section we present an alternate construction that achieves an 𝛼-ST of length at most 16/3 times the MST length, thereby proving the following theorem.

Theorem 1
Given a set of points in the plane and an angle 𝛼⩾2𝜋/3, there is

an 𝛼-spanning tree of length at most 16/3 times the length of the MST. Furthermore, there is a polynomial time algorithm to find such an 𝛼-ST, thus providing a 16/3-approximation algorithm for the 𝛼-MST problem.

The Construction of Aschner and Katz
To facilitate comparisons, we briefly describe the algorithm of Aschner and Katz [4]. They use the following theorems to compute an 𝛼-ST.

Theorem 2
(Aschner and Katz, 2014) Given a set P of three points in the plane, one can place at each point of P a wedge of angle 2𝜋/3 such that the three wedges cover the plane and the induced mutual-visibility graph on P is connected, and hence it contains a 2𝜋/3-ST.

A placement that satisfies the conditions of Theorem 2 is given in the proof of Claim 2.1 [4]. This placement has an interesting property which is given in the following theorem whose proof is involved.

Theorem 3
(Aschner and Katz, 2014) Let 𝑃1 and 𝑃2 be two disjoint sets each containing three points in the plane. Assume that a wedge of angle 2𝜋/3 is placed at each point of 𝑃1 and at each point of 𝑃2 according to the placement of Theorem 2. Then, the induced mutual-visibility graph on 𝑃1∪𝑃2 is connected, and hence it contains a 2𝜋/3-ST.

Let H be a Hamiltonian path on P of length at most 2 times the MST length. The constant 2 is tight, since Fekete et al. [22] showed that for any fixed 𝜀>0 there exists a point set for which any Hamiltonian path has length at least 2−𝜀 times the MST length.

Let (𝑝0,…,𝑝𝑛−1) be the sequence of points of P from one endpoint of H to the other. Let (ℎ0,ℎ1,…,ℎ𝑛−2) be the sequence of the edges of H where ℎ𝑖=(𝑝𝑖,𝑝𝑖+1). Partition the edges of H into three sets 𝐻0={ℎ0,ℎ3,ℎ6,…}, 𝐻1={ℎ1,ℎ4,ℎ7,…}, and 𝐻2={ℎ2,ℎ5,ℎ8,…}, as in Fig. 5. The length of one of these sets, say 𝐻2, is at least w(H)/3. Therefore 𝑤(𝐻0)+𝑤(𝐻1)⩽23𝑤(𝐻). Partition P into a sequence of triplets (𝑝0,𝑝1,𝑝2),(𝑝3,𝑝4,𝑝5),… such that the edges of H, that lie between consecutive triplets, are in 𝐻2. Then place three wedges on the points of each triplet according to Theorem 2, and let 𝐺𝛼 be the induced mutual-visibility graph. The points in each triplet are connected (by Theorem 2) and any pair of triplets is connected (by Theorem 3), and thus 𝐺𝛼 is connected.

Fig. 5
figure 5
Top: path H where 𝐻0, 𝐻1, 𝐻2 are colored blue, green, and red, respectively. Bottom: spanning tree T where edges obtained by Theorems 2 and 3 are colored purple and orange, respectively

Full size image
Now let T be a spanning tree of 𝐺𝛼 computed as follows (see Fig. 5): between the points in each triplet take two edges that are obtained from Theorem 2 (these edges are called inner edges), and between every two consecutive triplets take an edge that is obtained by Theorem 3 (these edges are called connecting edges). To bound the length of T, we charge edges of H for the edges of T. Every edge of H that belongs to 𝐻2 lies between two consecutive triplets, and thus is charged only once for the connecting edge between the two triplets. Every edge of H that belongs to 𝐻0∪𝐻1 lies inside a triplet, say t. Such an edge is charged 4 times: twice for the two inner edges of t and twice for the two edges that connect t to adjacent triplets. Therefore,

𝑤(𝑇)⩽𝑤(𝐻2)+4(𝑤(𝐻0)+𝑤(𝐻1))=𝑤(𝐻)+3(𝑤(𝐻0)+𝑤(𝐻1))⩽3𝑤(𝐻)⩽6𝑤(𝑀𝑆𝑇).
The New Construction
Our approach, for the construction of an 𝛼-ST of length at most 16/3 times the MST length, is similar to that of Aschner and Katz, however we use a different placement of wedges on points of triplets which in turn requires different proof techniques.

Let 𝑃={𝑝1,𝑝2,𝑝3} be any set of three points in the plane. The complete graph on P has edge set 𝐸={𝑝1𝑝2,𝑝1𝑝3,𝑝2𝑝3} and contains exactly three spanning trees. Let 𝑇1 be the tree that has the two shortest edges of E, 𝑇3 be the tree that has the two longest edges of E, and 𝑇2 be the tree that has the shortest and the longest edges of E. Observe that 𝑤(𝑇1)⩽𝑤(𝑇2)⩽𝑤(𝑇3). We refer to 𝑇1, 𝑇2, and 𝑇3 as the shortest, intermediate, and longest trees on P, respectively.

The 𝛼-ST obtained by the wedge placement in (the proof of) Theorem 2 contains the two longest edges of E. In other words, this placement gives the spanning tree 𝑇3. Due to the objective of minimizing the sum of edge lengths, one may ask for a wedge placement that covers the plane using 𝑇1 or 𝑇2. We answer this question in the affirmative in Theorem 4. This theorem improves Theorem 2 in the sense that it uses 𝑇1 or 𝑇2 and also allows more flexibility on the angles of the wedges.

Consider three points in the plane, and three angles 𝛼1,𝛼2,𝛼3 where each 𝛼𝑖 is at most 𝜋 and 𝛼1+𝛼2+𝛼3=2𝜋. The Floodlight result of Bose et al. [11] implies that one can cover the plane by placing three wedges of angles 𝛼1,𝛼2,𝛼3 at the three points. Our Theorem 4 also improves this result in two ways: (i) one can cover the plane with three wedges even if the assignment of angles to points is specified in advance, and (ii) the induced mutual-visibility graph is connected, in particular it contains the shortest or the intermediate tree on the points.

Theorem 4
(proved in Sect. 3.3) Given a set 𝑃={𝑝1,𝑝2,𝑝3} of three points in the plane and three angles 𝛼1,𝛼2,𝛼3⩽𝜋 where 𝛼1+𝛼2+𝛼3=2𝜋, one can place at each 𝑝𝑖 a wedge of angle 𝛼𝑖 such that the three wedges cover the plane and the induced mutual-visibility graph contains the shortest or the intermediate tree on P.

If we set each 𝛼𝑖 equal to 2𝜋/3 in Theorem 4, then we get the following corollary.

Corollary 1
Given a set P of three points in the plane, one can place wedges of angle 2𝜋/3 at points of P such that the three wedges cover the plane and the induced mutual-visibility graph contains the shortest or the intermediate tree on P.

Corollary 1 ensures covering of the plane and also uses 𝑇1 or 𝑇2. Unfortunately, we cannot directly use this corollary in the approach of Aschner and Katz because their Theorem 3 ensures a connection between two triplets 𝑡1 and 𝑡2 only if they are oriented by Theorem 2; such a connection may not exist if the triplets are oriented by Corollary 1. However, we show in Theorem 5 that if the relative positions of the points of 𝑡1 and 𝑡2 is not among the two configurations shown in Fig. 6, then the orientation of Corollary 1 ensures a connection between them. Our final proof relies on the fact that the configurations in Fig. 6 never arise from triplets of a non-crossing Hamiltonian path.

To be more precise, consider disjoint point sets 𝑃1 and 𝑃2, each of size three, in the plane. Let 𝐾1 and 𝐾2 be the complete graphs (triangles) on points of 𝑃1 and 𝑃2, respectively. We say that the (unordered) pair {𝑃1,𝑃2} is forbidden if there exist vertices 𝑝∈𝐾1 and 𝑞∈𝐾2 such that (i) both edges incident to p intersect both edges incident to q, or (ii) p lies inside the triangle 𝐾2 and the edge of 𝐾1 not incident to p intersects both edges incident to q. See Fig. 6.

Theorem 5
(proved in Sect. 3.4) Let 𝑃1 and 𝑃2 be two disjoint sets, each containing three points in the plane, such that {𝑃1,𝑃2} is not forbidden. Assume that a wedge of angle 2𝜋/3 is placed at each point of 𝑃1 and at each point of 𝑃2 according to the placement algorithm of Corollary 1. Then, the induced mutual-visibility graph on 𝑃1∪𝑃2 is connected, and hence it contains a 2𝜋/3-ST.

Intuitively, it would seem that our proof of Theorem 5 should follow the same approach as that of Aschner and Katz’s Theorem 3. We note, however, that their proof of Theorem 3 is highly involved and uses a combination of nontrivial ideas. In order to cope with the large number of cases, they classify the number of edges in the induced mutual-visibility graph of each triplet. Their proof ensures the existence of an edge between 𝑃1 and 𝑃2 only if the wedges are oriented according to the placement in the proof of Theorem 2. Such an edge may not exist for other wedge placements with similar properties, i.e., coverage of the plane and connectivity of each set 𝑃1 and 𝑃2; for example see Fig. 7 which is borrowed from [4] (notice that the pair of triplets in this figure is forbidden).

Thus, there is no straightforward way of adjusting their proof to work for our Theorem 5 where the wedges in 𝑃1 and 𝑃2 are oriented according to Corollary 1. We give a relatively short proof of Theorem 5 in Sect. 3.4. Instead of classifying the number of edges of visibility graphs, we introduce a “representative” point for each triplet; this facilitates a shorter presentation of our proof.

The remaining ingredient we need in order to apply Theorem 5 is the following observation that forbidden triplets do not arise if we begin with a Hamiltonian path H that is non-crossing.

Observation 1
Let H be a non-crossing Hamiltonian path and let 𝑡1 and 𝑡2 be disjoint triplets, each of which is obtained from consecutive vertices of H. Then, {𝑡1,𝑡2} is not forbidden.

Proof
Each of 𝑡1 and 𝑡2 must contain two edges of H (because they come from consecutive vertices of H), and the union of these edges is non-crossing because H is non-crossing. But if {𝑡1,𝑡2} is forbidden (see Fig. 6), then there is no way to choose two edges in each of 𝑡1 and 𝑡2 such that their union is non-crossing. ◻

To use this observation, we need a non-crossing Hamiltonian path. Such a path can be obtained by iteratively flipping crossing edges of H. It is known that this iterative process terminates after 𝑂(𝑛3) edge flips [32], where n is the number of path vertices. (See [9] for some recent results on obtaining non-crossing configurations by edge flips.) Since the edge flip operation does not increase the total edge length (this can be verified by the triangle inequality), the length of the resulting non-crossing path is not more than that of the original path. Therefore, we assume from now on that H is non-crossing and 𝑤(𝐻)⩽2𝑤(𝑀𝑆𝑇).

Now we have the necessary tools (a non-crossing path H and Theorem 5) to use the orientation of the wedges as in Corollary 1. Let (𝑝0,…,𝑝𝑛−1) be the sequence of points from one endpoint of H to the other. Construct edge sets 𝐻0, 𝐻1, 𝐻2, and as before assume that 𝑤(𝐻2)⩾𝑤(𝐻)/3, which implies 𝑤(𝐻0)+𝑤(𝐻1)⩽23𝑤(𝐻). Construct triplets 𝑡0=(𝑝0,𝑝1,𝑝2),𝑡1=(𝑝3,𝑝4,𝑝5),…, and orient the wedges according to Corollary 1. Since H is non-crossing, no pair of triplets is forbidden (by Observation 1). The induced mutual-visibility graph, 𝐺𝛼, is connected because the points of each triplet are connected (by Corollary 1) and every two triplets are connected (by Theorem 5). We obtain a spanning tree T from 𝐺𝛼 as before. Every edge of 𝐻2 is charged only once for the connecting edge between two consecutive triplets. Every pair (ℎ𝑖,ℎ𝑖+1) of edges in each triplet t (where ℎ𝑖∈𝐻0 and ℎ𝑖+1∈𝐻1) is charged 3.5 times: twice for connecting edges between t and its adjacent triplets, and 1.5 times for inner edges of t (by Lemma 1 the length of the tree obtained by Corollary 1 is at most 1.5(𝑤(ℎ𝑖)+𝑤(ℎ𝑖+1))). Therefore

𝑤(𝑇)⩽𝑤(𝐻2)+3.5(𝑤(𝐻0)+𝑤(𝐻1))=𝑤(𝐻)+2.5(𝑤(𝐻0)+𝑤(𝐻1))⩽𝑤(𝐻)+53𝑤(𝐻)=83𝑤(𝐻)⩽163𝑤(𝑀𝑆𝑇).
This finishes the proof of Theorem 1.

Proof of Theorem 4
In this section we prove the following theorem. First we provide some preliminaries for the proof. We use similar notation for the proof of Theorem 5 in Sect. 3.4.

Theorem 4Given a set 𝑃={𝑝1,𝑝2,𝑝3} of three points in the plane and three angles 𝛼1,𝛼2,𝛼3⩽𝜋 where 𝛼1+𝛼2+𝛼3=2𝜋, one can place at each 𝑝𝑖 a wedge of angle 𝛼𝑖 such that the three wedges cover the plane and the induced mutual-visibility graph contains the shortest or the intermediate tree on P.

figure a
Let p be a point in the plane and let [𝑟1→(𝑝),𝑟2→(𝑝),𝑟3→(𝑝)] be the cyclic counterclockwise permutation of three rays emanating from p where the angle between any two consecutive rays is less than 𝜋. See the figure to the right for an illustration. These rays partition the plane into three cones with apices at p. For an index 𝑖∈{1,2,3} we denote by 𝑟𝑖+1−→−(𝑝) the ray after 𝑟𝑖→(𝑝) in the cyclic permutation, by 𝑟𝑖←(𝑝) the ray emanating from p in the opposite direction of 𝑟𝑖→(𝑝), and by 𝑙𝑖(𝑝) the line through 𝑟𝑖→(𝑝). We denote by 𝑐𝑖(𝑝) the convex cone with boundary rays 𝑟𝑖→(𝑝) and 𝑟𝑖+1−→−(𝑝), and by 𝑐𝑖⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑝) the reflection of 𝑐𝑖(𝑝) with respect to p. Moreover, we denote by 𝑐𝑖𝑅(𝑝) the portion of 𝑐𝑖(𝑝) that is between 𝑟𝑖→(𝑝) and 𝑟𝑖+2←−−(𝑝), and by 𝑐𝑖𝐿(𝑝) the of portion 𝑐𝑖(𝑝) of that is between 𝑟𝑖+2←−−(𝑝) and 𝑟𝑖+1−→−(𝑝).

Proof
Consider the triangle with vertices 𝑝1, 𝑝2, and 𝑝3. Let 𝛽1,𝛽2,𝛽3 denote the interior angles of this triangle at 𝑝1,𝑝2,𝑝3 respectively, and note that 𝛽1+𝛽2+𝛽3=𝜋. Without loss of generality assume that 𝛽1⩽𝛽2⩽𝛽3, and thus |𝑝2𝑝3|⩽|𝑝1𝑝3|⩽|𝑝1𝑝2|. After a suitable reflection assume that 𝑝3 appears to the left of the ray from 𝑝1 towards 𝑝2. We consider two cases where 𝛼3⩾𝛽3 and 𝛼3<𝛽3. For each case we show how to place three wedges 𝑤1, 𝑤2, 𝑤3 (with angles 𝛼1,𝛼2,𝛼3) at points 𝑝1,𝑝2,𝑝3, respectively, to satisfy the conditions of the theorem.

Let [𝑟1→(𝑥),𝑟2→(𝑥),𝑟3→(𝑥)] be the cyclic counterclockwise permutation of three rays emanating from some point x in the plane such that the angle at each cone 𝑐𝑖(𝑥) is 𝛼𝑖 for 𝑖∈{1,2,3}. Let R(x) denote a fixed embedding of these rays in the plane, as in Fig. 8a.

𝛼3⩾𝛽3. Translate R(x) so that x lies on 𝑝3, i.e., 𝑥=𝑝3. Rotate R(x) so that 𝑝1 and 𝑝2 lie in 𝑐3(𝑝3) and 𝑟2←(𝑝3) intersects the segment 𝑝1𝑝2 (observe the existence of such rotation). Place 𝑤1, 𝑤2, and 𝑤3 at cones 𝑐1(𝑝3), 𝑐2(𝑝3), and 𝑐3(𝑝3), respectively. The union of these wedges covers the entire pane. Now translate 𝑤1 and 𝑤2 so that their apices lie on 𝑝1 and 𝑝2, respectively, as in Fig. 8b. The union of the three wedges still covers the plane. In this setting, 𝑝3 and 𝑝1 are mutually visible and so are 𝑝3 and 𝑝2. Thus, the mutual-visibility graph contains the shortest tree on P with edges 𝑇1={𝑝3↔𝑝1,𝑝3↔𝑝2}.

𝛼3<𝛽3. We claim that 𝛼2⩾𝛽2. For the sake of contradiction assume that 𝛼2<𝛽2. Then 𝛼1+𝛽2+𝛽3>𝛼1+𝛼2+𝛼3=2𝜋. Since 𝛽2 and 𝛽3 are interior angles of a triangle, 𝛽2+𝛽3⩽𝜋. By combining these two inequalities we get 𝛼1>𝜋, which contradicts that 𝛼1,𝛼2,𝛼3⩽𝜋. Thus our claim follows.

Translate R(x) so that x lies on 𝑝2. Rotate R(x) so that 𝑝1 and 𝑝3 lie in 𝑐2(𝑝2) and 𝑟1←(𝑝2) intersects the segment 𝑝1𝑝3. Place 𝑤1, 𝑤2,𝑤3 at cones 𝑐1(𝑝2), 𝑐2(𝑝2), 𝑐3(𝑝2). Translate 𝑤1 and 𝑤3 so that their apices lie on 𝑝1 and 𝑝3, respectively, as in Fig. 8c. Again the three wedges cover the entire plane, and the mutual-visibility graph contains the intermediate tree on P with edges 𝑇2={𝑝2↔𝑝1,𝑝2↔𝑝3}.

◻

Remark 1
Our proof of Theorem 4 has the following property: if x is a point of P at which R(x) is placed then each cone 𝑐𝑖⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥) contains a point of P whose wedge covers 𝑐𝑖(𝑥). For one of the cones, this point is x itself.

Proof of Theorem 5
In this section we prove the following theorem. We use notations introduced in Sect. 3.3.

Theorem 5Let 𝑃1 and 𝑃2 be two disjoint sets, each containing three points in the plane, such that {𝑃1,𝑃2} is not forbidden. Assume that a wedge of angle 2𝜋/3 is placed at each point of 𝑃1 and at each point of 𝑃2 according to the placement algorithm of Corollary 1. Then, the induced mutual-visibility graph on 𝑃1∪𝑃2 is connected, and hence it contains a 2𝜋/3-ST.

We use the notation introduced in Sect. 3.3. Let 𝑃1={𝑎,𝑏,𝑐} and 𝑃2={𝑎′,𝑏′,𝑐′}. Orient 𝑃1 and 𝑃2 according to Corollary 1 (in fact according to the proof of Theorem 4 with angles 2𝜋/3). Let 𝑤𝑎, 𝑤𝑏, 𝑤𝑐, 𝑤𝑎′, 𝑤𝑏′ and 𝑤𝑐′ be the wedges of angle 2𝜋/3 that are placed at these points, respectively. Recall, from the proof of Theorem 4, three rays [𝑟1→(𝑥),𝑟2→(𝑥),𝑟3→(𝑥)] with cones of angle 2𝜋/3 placed at a point x. In the orientation of 𝑃1 we may assume that these rays are placed at a, i.e., 𝑥=𝑎. Thus b and c lie in the same cone 𝑐𝑖(𝑎) for some 𝑖∈{1,2,3}; in particular one of them lies in 𝑐𝑖𝐿(𝑎) and the other lies in 𝑐𝑖𝑅(𝑎). Moreover 𝑤𝑎 covers 𝑐𝑖(𝑎) and we have 𝑎↔𝑏 and 𝑎↔𝑐. In the orientation of 𝑃2 assume that these rays are placed at 𝑎′. Thus one of 𝑏′ and 𝑐′ lies in 𝑐𝑗𝐿(𝑎′) and the other lies in 𝑐𝑗𝑅(𝑎′) for some 𝑗∈{1,2,3}, 𝑤𝑎′ covers 𝑐𝑗(𝑎′), and we have 𝑎′↔𝑏′ and 𝑎′↔𝑐′. By Remark 1 each cone 𝑐𝑖⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎) contains a point of 𝑃1 whose wedge covers 𝑐𝑖(𝑎), and similarly each cone 𝑐𝑗⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎′) contains a point of 𝑃2 whose wedge covers 𝑐𝑗(𝑎′).

Full size image
Since the three cones 𝑐1(𝑎), 𝑐2(𝑎), and 𝑐3(𝑎) cover the plane, 𝑎′ lies in one of them, say 𝑐3(𝑎). Similarly, a lies in one of the three cones at 𝑎′, say 𝑐2(𝑎′). In this setting one of the following three configurations holds:

(A)
𝑟1→(𝑎) and 𝑟2→(𝑎′) intersect, but 𝑟3→(𝑎) and 𝑟3→(𝑎′) do not intersect. See Figs. 9, 10 and 11.

(B)
𝑟1→(𝑎) and 𝑟2→(𝑎′) do not intersect, but 𝑟3→(𝑎) and 𝑟3→(𝑎′) intersect.

(C)
𝑟1→(𝑎) and 𝑟2→(𝑎′) intersect, and 𝑟3→(𝑎) and 𝑟3→(𝑎′) intersect. See Figs. 12 and 13.

We consider each configuration separately. Since configurations (A) and (B) are symmetric, we describe only (A) and (C).

Configuration (A). Let d be the intersection point of 𝑟1→(𝑎) with 𝑟2→(𝑎′), and let 𝛾 denote the convex angle ∠𝑎𝑑𝑎′, as in Fig. 9. Since 𝑟3→(𝑎) and 𝑟3→(𝑎′) do not intersect, 𝛾⩾2𝜋/3, and consequently 𝑎′ lies in 𝑐3𝐿(𝑎) and a lies in 𝑐2𝑅(𝑎′). Recall that each cone at a (resp. 𝑎′) is covered by a wedge at a point of 𝑃1 (resp. 𝑃2). Let 𝑥∈𝑃1 be the point in 𝑐3⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎) whose wedge 𝑤𝑥 covers 𝑐3(𝑎), and let 𝑥′∈𝑃2 be the point in 𝑐2⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎′) whose wedge 𝑤𝑥′ covers 𝑐2(𝑎′). If 𝑥∈𝑐3⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎)∩𝑐2(𝑎′) and 𝑥′∈𝑐2⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎′)∩𝑐3(𝑎) (the dark-gray regions in Fig. 9) then 𝑥↔𝑥′ and we are done. Therefore we may assume that 𝑥∈𝑐3⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎)∖𝑐2(𝑎′) or 𝑥′∈𝑐2⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎′)∖𝑐3(𝑎). By symmetry we assume that 𝑥′∈𝑐2⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎′)∖𝑐3(𝑎) (the light-gray region in Fig. 10). This and the fact that 𝑎′∈𝑐3(𝑎) imply that 𝑥′≠𝑎′, and thus 𝑥′∈{𝑏′,𝑐′}. After a suitable relabeling we assume that 𝑥′=𝑏′. Therefore, 𝑤𝑏′ covers 𝑐2(𝑎′).

𝑟1→(𝑎) and 𝑟2→(𝑎′) intersect, 𝑟3→(𝑎) and 𝑟3→(𝑎′) do not intersect, and 𝑏′∈𝑐1𝑅(𝑎′)∩𝑐1(𝑎)

Since 𝛾⩾2𝜋/3 and 𝑎′∈𝑐3𝐿(𝑎), the rays 𝑟3←(𝑎′) and 𝑟2←(𝑎′) do not intersect 𝑙2(𝑎) (which is the line through 𝑟2→(𝑎)), and consequently the cone 𝑐2⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎′) does not intersect 𝑙2(𝑎) and hence this cone is disjoint from 𝑐2(𝑎). Therefore, 𝑏′—which is in 𝑐2⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎′)∖𝑐3(𝑎)—lies in 𝑐1(𝑎). Let 𝑦∈𝑃1 be the point in 𝑐1⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎) whose wedge 𝑤𝑦 covers 𝑐1(𝑎). Since 𝑏′∈𝑐1(𝑎), the point y sees 𝑏′, as in Fig. 10. If 𝑦∈𝑐1⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎)∩𝑤𝑏′ (the dark-blue region) then 𝑏′ sees y, and hence 𝑦↔𝑏′ and we are done. Assume that 𝑦∈𝑐1⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎)∖𝑤𝑏′, and hence it is not in 𝑐2(𝑎′). Since 𝑦∈𝑐1⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎) and 𝑐1⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎) is disjoint from 𝑐1(𝑎′), the point y is not in 𝑐1(𝑎′) either. Thus y lies in 𝑐3(𝑎′). In this setting, 𝑤𝑦 covers the region 𝑐3𝐿(𝑎)∩𝑤𝑏′ which contains 𝑎′. Thus, y sees 𝑎′. Recall that 𝑏′∈𝑐2⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎′)∩𝑐1(𝑎). Since 𝑐2⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎′)=𝑐3𝐿(𝑎′)∪𝑐1𝑅(𝑎′) we consider two cases where 𝑏′∈𝑐3𝐿(𝑎′)∩𝑐1(𝑎) and 𝑏′∈𝑐1𝑅(𝑎′)∩𝑐1(𝑎).

𝑏′∈𝑐3𝐿(𝑎′)∩𝑐1(𝑎). This case is depicted in Fig. 10. Since 𝑏′∈𝑐3(𝑎′) and 𝑤𝑎′ covers the cone that contains 𝑏′ (and also 𝑐′), it covers 𝑐3(𝑎′). Therefore, 𝑎′ sees y which lies in 𝑐3(𝑎′), and hence 𝑦↔𝑎′ and we are done.

𝑏′∈𝑐1𝑅(𝑎′)∩𝑐1(𝑎). This case is depicted in Fig. 11. Since 𝑏′∈𝑐1(𝑎′) and 𝑤𝑎′ covers the cone that contains 𝑏′, it covers 𝑐1(𝑎′). Since 𝑦∈𝑐3(𝑎′) and 𝑎∈𝑐2(𝑎′), we have 𝑦≠𝑎 and thus 𝑦∈{𝑏,𝑐}. After a suitable relabeling we assume that 𝑦=𝑏. Therefore 𝑤𝑏 covers 𝑐1(𝑎), and 𝑤𝑎 covers the cone 𝑐3(𝑎) which contains b. Since b lies in 𝑐3𝑅(𝑎), the point c lies in 𝑐3𝐿(𝑎). Notice that 𝑤𝑐 covers 𝑐2(𝑎) (which is not covered by 𝑤𝑎∪𝑤𝑏).

Since 𝑏′∈𝑐1𝑅(𝑎′), the points 𝑐′ lies in 𝑐1𝐿(𝑎′) and 𝑤𝑐′ covers 𝑐3(𝑎′), and hence sees b. If 𝑐′∈𝑐1𝐿(𝑎′)∩𝑤𝑏 (the dark-orange region in Fig. 11) then b sees 𝑐′ and we get 𝑐′↔𝑏. Assume that 𝑐′∈𝑐1𝐿(𝑎′)∖𝑤𝑏 (the light-orange region). This region is to the left of 𝑤𝑏←− which is parallel to 𝑟2→(𝑎); in particular this region is a subset of 𝑐2𝑅(𝑎) which is covered by 𝑤𝑐. Thus c sees 𝑐′. We are going to show that 𝑐′ also sees c. Notice that 𝑐2𝑅(𝑎) (which contains 𝑐′) is the reflection of 𝑐3𝐿(𝑎) (which contains c) with respect to a. This and the fact that 𝑤𝑐′←−− is parallel to 𝑟1→(𝑎′) which intersects 𝑟1→(𝑎) (because 𝛾⩾2𝜋/3) imply that 𝑤𝑐′←−− does not intersect 𝑟1→(𝑎). Moreover, since 𝑤𝑐′−→− is parallel to 𝑟3→(𝑎′) which intersects 𝑟2←(𝑎) (because 𝛾<𝜋), 𝑤𝑐′−→− does not intersect 𝑟2←(𝑎). Thus 𝑤𝑐′−→− and 𝑤𝑐′←−− do not intersect the boundary rays 𝑟1→(𝑎) and 𝑟2←(𝑎) of 𝑐3𝐿(𝑎), and hence 𝑤𝑐′ covers 𝑐3𝐿(𝑎) which contains 𝑐′. Therefore 𝑐′ sees c and hence 𝑐′↔𝑐.

Configuration (C). In this configuration 𝑟1→(𝑎′) does not intersect any of 𝑟1→(𝑎), 𝑟2→(𝑎), 𝑟3→(𝑎), and 𝑟2→(𝑎) does not intersect any of 𝑟1→(𝑎′), 𝑟2→(𝑎′), 𝑟3→(𝑎′). Let d be the intersection point of 𝑟1→(𝑎) with 𝑟2→(𝑎′), and e be the intersection point of 𝑟3→(𝑎) with 𝑟3→(𝑎′), as in Figs. 12 and 13. Let 𝛾 denote the convex angle ∠𝑎𝑑𝑎′, and 𝛽 denote the convex angle ∠𝑎𝑒𝑎′. After a suitable relabeling we assume that 𝛾⩾𝛽, and thus 𝛾⩾𝜋/3 (notice that the sum of the interior angles of the convex quadrilateral with vertices 𝑎,𝑑,𝑎′,𝑒 is 2𝜋). This and the fact that ∠𝑒𝑎𝑑=2𝜋/3 imply that 𝑟3→(𝑎) and 𝑟2←(𝑎′) do not intersect. Since 𝑟3→(𝑎) and 𝑟3→(𝑎′) intersect, their opposite rays 𝑟3←(𝑎) and 𝑟3←(𝑎′) do not intersect.

Let 𝑥∈𝑃1 be the point in 𝑐3⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎) whose wedge 𝑤𝑥 covers 𝑐3(𝑎), and let 𝑥′∈𝑃2 be the point in 𝑐2⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎′) whose wedge 𝑤𝑥′ covers 𝑐2(𝑎′). As in configuration (A) if 𝑥∈𝑐3⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎)∩𝑐2(𝑎′) and 𝑥′∈𝑐2⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎′)∩𝑐3(𝑎) (the dark-gray regions in Figs. 12 and 13) then 𝑥↔𝑥′. Therefore we may assume by symmetry that 𝑥′∈𝑐2⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎′)∖𝑐3(𝑎). This and the fact that 𝑎′∈𝑐3(𝑎) imply that 𝑥′≠𝑎′ and thus 𝑥′∈{𝑏′,𝑐′}. After a suitable relabeling we assume that 𝑥′=𝑏′, and thus 𝑤𝑏′ covers 𝑐2(𝑎′), as in Figs. 12 and 13. The region 𝑐2⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎′)∖𝑐3(𝑎) (shown by light-gray color in Figs. 12 and 13) which contains 𝑏′ is in fact equal to 𝑐1𝑅(𝑎′)∩𝑐1𝑅(𝑎).

The wedge 𝑤𝑎′ covers 𝑐1(𝑎′) which contains 𝑏′. Since 𝑏′ lies in 𝑐1𝑅(𝑎′), the point 𝑐′ lies in 𝑐1𝐿(𝑎′) and 𝑤𝑐′ covers 𝑐3(𝑎′). Let 𝑦∈𝑃1 be the point in 𝑐1⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎) whose wedge 𝑤𝑦 covers 𝑐1(𝑎). Since 𝑏′∈𝑐1(𝑎), y sees 𝑏′. If 𝑦∈𝑐1⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎)∩𝑤𝑏′ (the dark-blue regions in Figs. 12 and 13) then 𝑏′ sees y and thus 𝑦↔𝑏′ and we are done. Assume that 𝑦∈𝑐1⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎)∖𝑤𝑏′ (the light-blue regions). This and the fact that a lies in 𝑐2(𝑎′) (which is covered by 𝑤𝑏′) imply that 𝑦≠𝑎 and thus 𝑦∈{𝑏,𝑐}. After a suitable relabeling we assume that 𝑦=𝑏. Our assumption that b is not in 𝑤𝑏′ implies that 𝑏∉𝑐2(𝑎′). Recall that 𝑎′ is in 𝑐3(𝑎) and thus it lies either in 𝑐3𝐿(𝑎) or in 𝑐3𝑅(𝑎). We describe each case separately.

𝑎′∈𝑐3𝐿(𝑎). This case is depicted in Fig. 12. In this case 𝑟1→(𝑎′) and 𝑟2←(𝑎) do not intersect because 𝛾⩾𝜋/3. Thus 𝑐1⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎) and 𝑐1(𝑎′) are disjoint, and hence 𝑏∉𝑐1(𝑎′). Therefore 𝑏∈𝑐3(𝑎′) and thus 𝑐′ sees b. The boundary rays 𝑤𝑏←− and 𝑤𝑏−→ of 𝑤𝑏 do not intersect the boundary rays 𝑟2→(𝑎′) and 𝑟3←(𝑎′) of cone 𝑐1𝐿(𝑎′) which contains 𝑐′. Therefore 𝑤𝑏 covers 𝑐1𝐿(𝑎′). This implies that b sees 𝑐′, and hence 𝑏↔𝑐′.

𝑎′∈𝑐3𝑅(𝑎). See Fig. 13. If 𝑐′ is to the left side of 𝑟2←(𝑎) then 𝑏↔𝑐′ and we are done. Assume that 𝑐′ is to the right side of 𝑟2←(𝑎), and thus 𝑐′∈𝑐3𝑅(𝑎). If 𝑐′ is to the right side of 𝑤𝑏←− then again 𝑏↔𝑐′ and we are done. Assume that 𝑐′ is to the left side of 𝑤𝑏←−, which implies that 𝑏∈𝑐3𝑅(𝑎) (we already knew that b is in 𝑐1⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑎)=𝑐2𝐿(𝑎)∪𝑐3𝑅(𝑎)). Therefore 𝑤𝑎 covers 𝑐3(𝑎) which contains b, and thus c lies in 𝑐3𝐿(𝑎). This setting is depicted in Fig. 13. We show that this is an invalid setting for points in 𝑃1 and 𝑃2.

Consider the line through a and b. In the current setting 𝑎′ and 𝑐′ lie on the same side of this line, but 𝑏′ lies on the other side. The points 𝑎′ and 𝑐′ are to the left side of the ray 𝑏′𝑎−→ (because 𝑏′𝑎−→ does not intersect the interior of 𝑐3(𝑎) which contains 𝑎′ and 𝑐′) and to the right side of the ray 𝑏′𝑏−→ (because b is to the left side of 𝑤𝑏′←−− while 𝑎′ and 𝑐′ are to its right side); see also Fig. 14. Therefore 𝑎′ and 𝑐′ lie in the convex cone with boundary rays 𝑏′𝑎−→ and 𝑏′𝑏−→. Since c is in 𝑐3𝐿(𝑎), it is also in the convex cone with boundary rays 𝑎𝑏′−→ and 𝑎𝑏−→. As depicted in Fig. 14, no matter where—in this cone—c lies, the two triangles defined by the vertices of 𝑃1 and 𝑃2 form one of the forbidden configurations of Fig. 6. This is impossible because {𝑃1,𝑃2} is not forbidden by the statement of the theorem.

Approximating the 2𝜋/3⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯-MST
In this section we prove the following theorem.

Theorem 6
Given a set of points in the plane and an angle 𝛼⩾2𝜋/3, there is an 𝛼⎯⎯⎯-spanning tree of length at most 1.5 times the length of the MST and with edges of length at most 2 times the largest edge-length of the BST. Furthermore, there is an algorithm to find such an 𝛼⎯⎯⎯-ST that runs in linear time after computing the MST.

Let P be a set of points in the plane. As in previous sections we assume that 𝛼=2𝜋/3. Let T be a degree-5 MST of P. We assign to each vertex of T an initial angle 𝛼 which we refer to as “charge”. The initial charge of a vertex may not cover all its incident edges. The idea is to modify the tree locally and transfer charges between nodes to make sure that all vertices have enough charges to cover their incident edges in the new tree. Mainly we transfer charges from leaves to internal vertices, because edges incident to leaves can be covered by wedges of angle zero (however at the end of this section we assign positive wedges to all leaves).

Assume that T is not a path and thus has a vertex of degree at least 3 (we describe the case where T is a path at the end of this section). A maximal path in T is a path with at least two edges where its internal-node degrees are 2 and its end-node degrees are not 2.

Our algorithm has two phases. Phase 1 works as follows. Contract every maximal path of T to an edge (this is done by removing the internal nodes of the path and connecting its endpoints by an edge). This results in a tree 𝑇′ that has no vertex of degree 2, and moreover, the degree of each vertex in 𝑇′ is the same as its degree in T. Let ℓ denote the number of leaves of 𝑇′ and let 𝑛3, 𝑛4, and 𝑛5 denote the number of vertices of degree three, four, and five in 𝑇′ respectively. Since each vertex of degree three, four, and five introduces 1, 2, and 3 new leaves respectively, we have ℓ=2+𝑛3+2𝑛4+3𝑛5. We consider the ℓ⋅𝛼 charges of all leaves as a “pool of charges” that are available to be distributed among other vertices. From this pool, we give the charge 𝛼, 2𝛼, and 3𝛼 to each vertex of degree three, four, and five respectively. After this redistribution, every vertex of degree three, four, and five holds the charge 4𝜋/3, 2𝜋, and 8𝜋/3 respectively (including its initial 2𝜋/3 charge), which is sufficient to cover all its incident edges. Moreover, the pool is left with 2𝛼 charges.

Based on the above discussion if T has no degree-2 vertices, then it is an 𝛼⎯⎯⎯-ST and we are done. Now we describe Phase 2 which takes care of contracted paths; here is the place where our tree gains an extra 0.5w(T) length. Consider every contracted path and denote it by (𝑝1,𝑝2,…,𝑝𝑚) if it has an even number of edges and by (𝑝1,𝑝2,…,𝑝𝑚,𝑝𝑚+1) if it has an odd number of edges. One endpoint of this path, say 𝑝1, has degree at least 3 in T and the other endpoint either is a leaf or it has degree at least 3 (see Fig. 15). The charges of the two endpoints of the path have already been considered in Phase 1, but the charges of its internal nodes are untouched. Let 𝜎 denote the path (𝑝1,𝑝2,…,𝑝𝑚); 𝜎 does not contain 𝑝𝑚+1 if this point exists. Observe that 𝑚⩾3. Partition the edges of 𝜎 into matchings 𝜎1={(𝑝1,𝑝2),(𝑝3,𝑝4),…} and 𝜎2={(𝑝2,𝑝3),(𝑝4,𝑝5),…}, as in Fig. 15. Let 𝜎max denote the heavier of 𝜎1 and 𝜎2 (i.e., the one with larger total length) and 𝜎min denote the lighter one. Thus 𝑤(𝜎min)⩽𝑤(𝜎max) and hence 𝑤(𝜎min)⩽0.5𝑤(𝜎). We replace the edge set 𝜎max in T by the edge set 𝛿={(𝑝1,𝑝3),(𝑝3,𝑝5),…,(𝑝𝑚−2,𝑝𝑚)}, as in Fig. 15. Let 𝑇″ be the tree obtained after performing this replacement for all contracted paths. Note that 𝑇″ can be constructed in linear time from T.

We claim that 𝑇″ is a desired 𝛼⎯⎯⎯-ST. First we show that 𝑤(𝑇″)⩽1.5𝑤(𝑇). To do so, it suffices to show that, for each contracted path, the length of edges after replacement (i.e., edges of 𝜎min and 𝛿) is not more than 1.5 times the length of original edges (i.e., edges of 𝜎). By the triangle inequality, 𝑤(𝛿)⩽𝑤(𝜎). Therefore 𝑤(𝛿)+𝑤(𝜎min)⩽𝑤(𝜎)+0.5𝑤(𝜎)⩽1.5𝑤(𝜎); this proves the total-length constraint of Theorem 6. Moreover, the length of every edge of 𝛿 is at most twice the largest edge-length of 𝜎 (again by the triangle inequality); this proves the largest edge-length constraint of Theorem 6. It remains to ensure the coverage of incident edges for all vertices of 𝑇″. To that end we distribute the charges of 𝑝2,𝑝4,…,𝑝𝑚−1 (which are new leaves) among other vertices. We consider two cases depending on the existence of 𝑝𝑚+1. First assume that 𝑝𝑚+1 does not exist. Now we consider two sub-cases depending on which of 𝜎1 and 𝜎2 is heavier (i.e., is 𝜎max).

𝜎max=𝜎1. In this case 𝜎1 has been replaced by 𝛿. This replacement has not changed the degree of 𝑝1 and thus it holds enough charge (from Phase 1) to cover its incident edges. We move the charges of leaves 𝑝2, 𝑝4, …,𝑝𝑚−1 to vertices 𝑝3,𝑝5,…,𝑝𝑚 respectively (see Fig. 15-top). Each of 𝑝3,𝑝5,…,𝑝𝑚−2 has degree three and now holds 4𝜋/3 charge (including its own 2𝜋/3 charge) which is sufficient to cover its incident edges. Now consider 𝑝𝑚 and notice that its degree has been increased by one. If 𝑝𝑚 is of degree at least 3 in T, then it now holds at least 2𝜋 charge (2𝜋/3 from 𝑝𝑚−1 and at least 4𝜋/3 from Phase 1) which covers all its incident edges. Assume that 𝑝𝑚 is a leaf in T, and thus it has degree 2 in 𝑇″. The original charge of 𝑝𝑚 has been distributed among other vertices in Phase 1, but it now has 2𝜋/3 charge coming from 𝑝𝑚−1. Consider the triangle △𝑝𝑚𝑝𝑚−1𝑝𝑚−2. The segment 𝑝𝑚𝑝𝑚−2 is the largest side of this triangle because otherwise we could add this edge to the MST and remove the larger of the other two sides to obtain a smaller tree. Thus the angle at 𝑝𝑚−1 is the largest angle of this triangle, and hence the other two angles (including the one at 𝑝𝑚) are at most 𝜋/2. Therefore the two edges incident to 𝑝𝑚 can be covered by its 2𝜋/3 charge.

𝜎max=𝜎2. Then 𝜎2 has been replaced by 𝛿. We move the charges of 𝑝2, 𝑝4, …,𝑝𝑚−1 to 𝑝1,𝑝3,…,𝑝𝑚−2 respectively (see Fig. 15-second from top). The replacement does not change the degree of 𝑝𝑚 and thus it holds enough charge from Phase 1 to cover its incident edges. Each of 𝑝3, 𝑝5, …,𝑝𝑚−2 has degree three and now holds 4𝜋/3 charge which covers its incident edges. The vertex 𝑝1 now has at least 2𝜋 charge (2𝜋/3 from 𝑝2 and at least 4𝜋/3 from Phase 1) which covers all its incident edges.

Now assume that 𝑝𝑚+1 exists. Again we consider two sub-cases.

𝜎max=𝜎1. Move the charges of 𝑝2,𝑝4,…,𝑝𝑚−1 to 𝑝3,𝑝5,…,𝑝𝑚 (see Fig. 15-third from top). The degrees of 𝑝1 and 𝑝𝑚+1 have not changed in Phase 2, and thus they hold enough charge from Phase 1 to cover their incident edges. Each of 𝑝3,𝑝5,…,𝑝𝑚 has degree three and now holds 4𝜋/3 charge which covers its incident edges.

𝜎max=𝜎2. Move the charges of 𝑝4,𝑝6…,𝑝𝑚−1 to 𝑝3,𝑝5,…,𝑝𝑚−2. Split the 2𝜋/3 charge of 𝑝2 evenly between 𝑝1 and 𝑝𝑚 as in Fig. 15-bottom. The degree of 𝑝𝑚+1 has not changed and thus it holds enough charge from Phase 1. Each of 𝑝3,𝑝5,…,𝑝𝑚−2 has degree three and now holds enough charge 4𝜋/3. The vertex 𝑝𝑚 has degree two and now holds 𝜋 charge (including its original 2𝜋/3 charge) which is sufficient to cover its two incident edges. Now consider 𝑝1. If it has degree 4 or 5 in T then after Phase 1 it holds at least 2𝜋 charge which covers all its incident edges. Assume that it has degree 3 in T, and now it has degree 4 in 𝑇″. Then it holds 5𝜋/3 charge (𝜋/3 from 𝑝2 and 4𝜋/3 from Phase 1) which is enough to cover its four incident edges (in fact 3𝜋/2 is enough). It might be the case that 𝑝1 was also incident to another contracted path and hence has received another incident edge which increases 𝑝1’s degree to five. In this case 𝑝1 also receives 𝜋/3 charge from the other path. This would increase 𝑝1’s charge to 2𝜋 which covers all its incident edges.

Now we consider the case where T is a path. In this case we run only Phase 2 of the above algorithm on this path. Since there is no Phase 1, the charges of path endpoints are still available. The charge redistribution of Phase 2 guarantees the coverage of incident edges of all vertices. See Fig. 15. If 𝑝𝑚+1 does not exist then in the first sub-case (resp. the second sub-case) the charge of 𝑝1 (resp. 𝑝𝑚) remains unused. If 𝑝𝑚+1 exists, then its charge remains unused.

At the end of the algorithm we have at least 2𝜋/3 unused charge (from the pool or from a path endpoint). We split the unused charge evenly among all vertices such that every vertex has a positive charge and its incident edges lie strictly inside the assigned wedge.

Conclusions
The obvious open problem is to improve our 16/3 approximation ratio for the 2𝜋/3-MST problem further by designing better algorithms. Our proof relies on the fact that the orientation of the wedges of every triplet covers the entire plane. Such orientations are a bottleneck for our ratio. It might be possible to get a better ratio with orientations that do not necessarily cover the entire plane. Another bottleneck is the use of a Hamiltonian path which forces a factor of 2 in the ratio. It might be possible to get better ratios by using the original MST instead of the path. However, this has to be done in a clever way as the number of connecting edges incident to a triplet may increase.
