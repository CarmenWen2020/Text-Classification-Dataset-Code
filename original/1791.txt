Abstract—Cloud providers typically use air-based solutions for
cooling servers in datacenters. However, increasing transistor
counts and the end of Dennard scaling will result in chips
with thermal design power that exceeds the capabilities of air
cooling in the near future. Consequently, providers have started
to explore liquid cooling solutions (e.g., cold plates, immersion
cooling) for the most power-hungry workloads. By keeping the
servers cooler, these new solutions enable providers to operate
server components beyond the normal frequency range (i.e.,
overclocking them) all the time. Still, providers must tradeoff the
increase in performance via overclocking with its higher power
draw and any component reliability implications.
In this paper, we argue that two-phase immersion cooling
(2PIC) is the most promising technology, and build three prototype 2PIC tanks. Given the benefits of 2PIC, we characterize
the impact of overclocking on performance, power, and reliability.
Moreover, we propose several new scenarios for taking advantage
of overclocking in cloud platforms, including oversubscribing
servers and virtual machine (VM) auto-scaling. For the autoscaling scenario, we build a system that leverages overclocking
for either hiding the latency of VM creation or postponing the
VM creations in the hopes of not needing them. Using realistic
cloud workloads running on a tank prototype, we show that
overclocking can improve performance by 20%, increase VM
packing density by 20%, and improve tail latency in auto-scaling
scenarios by 54%. The combination of 2PIC and overclocking
can reduce platform cost by up to 13% compared to air cooling.
Index Terms—Datacenter cooling, server overclocking, workload performance, power management.
I. INTRODUCTION
Motivation. Cloud providers typically use air-based solutions
(e.g., chillers, outside air) for cooling servers, as the wide
availability of expertise and equipment make it easy to install,
operate, and maintain such solutions.
Unfortunately, air cooling has many downsides. Its heat
dissipation efficiency is low, which requires large heat sinks
and fans that increase costs. Operating at higher component
junction temperatures results in higher leakage power [65],
which in turn negatively impacts energy efficiency [55]. It may
also degrade performance, due to hitting thermal limits. When
components approach those limits, performance is throttled by
reducing clock frequency. Most importantly going forward, the
trend of increasing transistor counts [66], coupled with the end
of Dennard scaling, will result in chips with thermal design
power (TDP) that is beyond the capabilities of air cooling in

the near future [23], [66]. For example, manufacturers expect
to produce CPUs and GPUs capable of drawing more than
500W in just a few years [23], [31], [66].
For these reasons, providers have started to explore liquid
cooling solutions (e.g., cold plates, liquid immersion) for their
most power-hungry workloads [3], [20], [68], [74]. These
technologies keep chip temperatures at a lower and narrower
range than air cooling, reducing leakage power, eliminating
the need for fans, and reducing datacenter Power Usage
Effectiveness (PUE), i.e. the ratio of total power to IT (e.g.,
server, networking) power. For example, Google cools its
Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) with cold plates [25], [52].
Alibaba introduced single-phase immersion cooling (1PIC)
tanks in their datacenters and showed that it reduces the total
power consumption by 36% and achieves a PUE of 1.07 [74].
The BitFury Group operates a 40+ MW facility that comprises
160 tanks and achieves a PUE of 1.02 [3] with two-phase
immersion cooling (2PIC).
Providers are still exploring the tradeoffs between these
technologies. However, we argue that immersion, and 2PIC
in particular, have significant advantages. Immersion is substantially easier to engineer and evolve over time than cold
plates. In 2PIC, IT equipment is immersed into a tank filled
with a dielectric liquid. The power dissipated by the equipment
makes the dielectric material boil and change from liquid to
gas. This phase change removes the heat from the chips, and
later the vapor is converted back to liquid using a condenser.
Moreover, we argue that, because immersion cooling offers
high thermal dissipation and low junction temperatures, it is
possible to operate server parts at higher frequencies (i.e.,
overclocking) for longer periods of time than ever possible
before. In fact, the capability to overclock opens up many
new directions to enhance system performance at scale.
However, overclocking does not come for free. Overclocking increases power consumption. Worse, it can impact component reliability (i.e., stability and lifetime). Furthermore, overclocking might not improve the performance for all workloads.
For example, overclocking the CPU running a memory-bound
workload will not result in much improvement in performance.
The problem of which component to overclock and when
is harder for cloud providers because they usually manage
Virtual Machines (VMs) and have little or no knowledge of the
workloads running on the VMs. For these reasons, providers
need to carefully manage overclocking to provide performance

benefits, while managing the associated risks and costs.
Our work. In this paper, we explore immersion cooling
technologies and the ability to overclock components while
managing its implications. We first compare air cooling, cold
plates, and immersion cooling for datacenters, and show that
2PIC is the most promising technology. We also describe our
immersion cooling tank prototypes (one of which we recently
started using in a production environment [47]).
Given the benefits of 2PIC, we then explore many aspects of
overclocking, starting with its power, component lifetime and
stability, and total cost of ownership (TCO) implications. We
then show how representative cloud workloads benefit from
operating servers at higher frequencies using one of our tank
prototypes. For example, we show how much workload tail
latency or execution time can be shortened when increasing
the frequency of the processor, the GPU, and the memory.
This helps to understand when overclocking can be beneficial
and when it is wasteful.
With this exploration in mind, we propose several scenarios
in which cloud providers can take advantage of overclocking,
each striking a different balance between performance, power,
and component lifetime. We explore three of them in more
detail: (1) offering high-performance VMs, (2) using overclocking to oversubscribe servers, and (3) using overclocking
to improve VM auto-scaling.
For the auto-scaling scenario, we build a system that leverages overclocking to (i) hide the latency of creating new VMs,
or (ii) postpone the creation of those VMs in the hopes of not
needing them (we call this latter approach “scale up and then
out”). To know whether and which component to overclock,
we leverage hardware counters and bottleneck analysis.
Our evaluation uses realistic cloud workloads running in
one of our 2PIC tank prototypes. The results show that
overclocking can improve workload performance by 20%
and increase VM packing density by 20% when combined
with CPU oversubscription. Our TCO analysis shows that
increasing density by just 10% would reduce the cost per
virtual core for Microsoft Azure by 13% in comparison to
today’s air-cooled scenario. For the auto-scaling scenario, our
results show that overclocking can improve the tail latency of
a latency-sensitive workload by 54% compared to a traditional
auto-scaling system.
Related work. We are not aware of prior studies of 2PIC
using realistic cloud workloads. Like us, the Computational
Sprinting work [21], [30], [59] considered overclocking when
thermal concerns are alleviated. However, those papers relied
on phase-change materials that could not sustain overclocking
for long periods. In contrast, from the thermal perspective,
2PIC enables overclocking all the time, opening up many new
avenues for how to use it. In fact, we are not aware of any
prior proposals to use overclocking extensively, much less in
the context of oversubscription or auto-scaling.
Summary. Our main contributions are:
• We explore the tradeoffs in liquid cooling and demonstrate
three 2PIC tank prototypes with different immersed hardware.

condenses back to liquid form. This process requires no additional energy. 1
• Overclocking has several side-effects that must be tradedoff carefully against its potential performance benefits. To
this end, we quantify the impact of overclocking in terms of
performance, power, lifetime, stability, and TCO. We show
overclocking performance and power results for multiple realistic cloud workloads run in the tank prototypes.
• We propose several scenarios for providers to leverage
overclocking in datacenters to reduce costs and/or enhance
customer experience. We build an overclocking-enhanced VM
auto-scaling system, as a detailed case study.
• We present extensive overclocking and auto-scaling results
from running realistic workloads in our tank prototypes.
II. IMMERSION COOLING IN DATACENTERS
Datacenter cooling today. Datacenters have been using airbased solutions to remove heat, including mainly (1) chillerbased, (2) water-side economized, and (3) direct evaporative
(free) cooling. Chiller-based cooling uses a closed-loop system
with a water chiller. Water-side economizing adds a cooling
tower to lower water temperatures via evaporation. Free cooling uses outside air and, when necessary, spraying the air with
water to reduce temperatures.
Liquid cooling. Recently, cloud providers introduced liquid
cooling to tackle rising chip temperatures. These initial efforts
have typically placed cold plates on the most power-hungry
components. Fluid flows through the plates and piping to
remove the heat produced by those components. Although
efficient, each cold plate needs to be specifically designed
and manufactured for each new component, which increases
engineering complexity and time to market. Moreover, cold
plates remove localized heat from power-hungry components
but typically still require air cooling for other components.
Immersion cooling. An alternative to cold plates is immersion
cooling, where entire servers are submerged in a tank and

the heat is dissipated by direct contact with a dielectric
liquid. There are no recurring engineering overheads. The heat
removal can happen in a single- or two-phase manner. In 1PIC,
the tank liquid absorbs the heat and circulates using pumps,
whereas in 2PIC a phase-change process from liquid to vapor
(via boiling) carries the heat away. As Figure 1 shows, the
vapor naturally rises to the top of the tank where a colder
coil condenses it back to liquid. No liquid is lost and the heat
transfers to the coil condenser secondary loop. Ultimately, the
heat carried in the coil is finally rejected with a dry cooler
(not shown). 2PIC can dissipate large amounts of heat.
Comparison. The technologies above have different efficiency
and power trade-offs, which we summarize in Table I. The
table lists publicly disclosed PUEs, server fan overheads from
Open Compute Platform Olympus servers [53], and data about
our own 2PIC prototypes. Overall, chiller-based systems supply servers with low and constant temperature and humidity,
but suffer from high PUE. Evaporative cooling lowers PUE,
but exposes servers to more aggressive environmental conditions and higher server fan overheads. Cold plates lower PUE
further, but with high engineering complexity. 2PIC achieves
even lower PUE, due to its more efficient heat transfer, without
the need for repeated engineering. The overheads of air cooling
only increase with higher server power, whereas they remain
fairly stable with liquid cooling.
In the rest of the paper, we focus exclusively on 2PIC, but
most of our findings apply to 1PIC and cold plates as well.
Liquids for immersion. Electronic fluids are specifically
engineered to effectively transfer heat from electronics without
compromising their lifetime and performance. Fluorinated
fluids have been extensively used in supercomputers and
Bitcoin mining with 1PIC or 2PIC. Examples include 3M’s
Fluorinert family (FC-3284) and Novec 7000 (HFE-7000).
They are designed to boil at specific temperatures. They are
non-conductive, non-toxic, repel moisture, and do not mix with
oxygen or air contaminants. They are also extremely inert
due to their chemical composition, which does not promote
interactions with the materials used in electronics. Table II
summarizes their main properties.
Surfaces with heat flux greater than 10W/cm2 require

boiling enhancing coating (BEC) [1], as it improves heat
transfer performance. Commonly applied areas are copper
boilers attached to the CPU integral heat spreader or directly
on the integral heat spreader, and there is no need for a heat
sink in liquid. In this paper, we use 3M’s L-20227 BEC for the
CPU, which improves boiling performance by 2× compared
to un-coated smooth surfaces.
III. OUR 2PIC TANK PROTOTYPES
To study immersion cooling and aggressive component
overclocking, we build three prototypes: (1) two small tanks
able to host 2 servers each and (2) a large tank hosting 36
servers. We use the small tanks to evaluate overclocking and
the large tank to perform thermal and reliability experiments.
Small tanks. Figures 2(b) and 2(d) show our two small tanks.
Figure 2(d) shows a view from above with the dielectric liquid
boiling. In small tank #1, we test a 28-core overclockable
Xeon Skylake W-3175X, shown in Figure 2(a), cooled with
the 3M Novec HFE-7000 liquid. We use data from this tank to
extrapolate to datacenter servers. In small tank #2, we test an
8-core Intel i9900k with an overclockable Nvidia RTX 2080ti
GPU, shown in Figure 2(c), cooled with the 3M FC-3284
liquid. In Figures 2(a) and 2(c), one can see the power-hungry
components without their heat sinks and covered with BEC. In
both tanks, we removed or disabled all the fans and removed
any stickers that can contaminate the liquids.
Large tank. In the large tank, we test 36 Open Compute 2-
socket server-class blades. Figure 3 shows three views of this
prototype: (a) outside the tank; (b) a server being removed;
and (c) all servers in place. Half of the blades are equipped
with 24-core Intel Skylake 8168 server (TDP 205W), and half
are equipped with 28-core Skylake 8180 server (TDP 205W).
The 36 blades are non-overclockable, and they are used to
test immersion thermal performance at a larger scale with

FC-3284. These processors are locked versions of the Xeon
W-3175X we use for overclocking. Each server consumes
a maximum of 700W: 410W for the processor (205W for
each socket), 120W for the memory (5W for each of the
24 DDR4 DIMMs), 26W for the motherboard, 30W for the
FPGA, 72W for storage (12W for each flash drive), and 42W
for the fans. We recently deployed this tank in a production
environment [47].
Air-cooled baseline. The same Open Compute server configured for air cooling (e.g., adding and enabling the fans) serves
as our baseline throughout the paper. We conducted all the
air-cooled experiments in a thermal chamber that supplied the
server with 110 cubic feet of air per minute at 35°C.
IV. OVERCLOCKING IN IMMERSION COOLING
Overclocking. Today, manufacturers allow CPUs and GPUs
to operate beyond their base (or nominal) frequency within a
controlled range [10], [33]. For example, Intel offers Turbo
Boost v2.0 [33], which opportunistically increases core speed
depending on the number of active cores and type of instructions executed. Figure 4 shows the allowable operating
frequency ranges for server-class processors today. Most times,
the processors operate within the guaranteed range between
the minimum and the base frequency. Only when the thermal
and power budgets permit, they can opportunistically operate
at turbo frequency to improve their performance.
Our analysis of Azure’s production telemetry reveals opportunities to operate processors at even higher frequencies
(overclocking domain) still with air cooling, depending on
the number of active cores and their utilizations. In this
domain, we can opportunistically operate components beyond
their pre-defined voltage, thermal and power design limits to
further improve performance for short periods. However, such
opportunities will diminish in future component generations
with higher TDP values, as air cooling will reach its limits.
In contrast, 2PIC has very high cooling capability and thereby
provides guaranteed overclocking, irrespective of utilization
and without a significant impact on operating temperatures.
Importantly, overclocking does not come for free and may
significantly impact (1) power consumption, (2) component

lifetime, (3) computational stability, (4) environmentals, and
(5) TCO. In this section, we evaluate the impact of enabling
overclocking in datacenters through a series of experiments
on servers in our tank prototypes. We then compare our
observations to the air-cooled Open Compute server, which
acts as the baseline. Although the processors in our large tank
are locked and restricted to their TDP, we will, for the rest
of this section, assume that they can be overclocked to 305W
(i.e., 100W higher than their original TDP); according to our
lifetime model, which we describe below, overclocking by
100W in 2PIC provides the same processor lifetime as the
air-cooled baseline with no overclocking. This overclocking
translates to an additional 200W of power for a dual-socket
server. We then leverage the overclockable Xeon W-3175X in
small tank #1 to extrapolate on the expected implications of
overclocking at scale.
Power consumption. Power is an important datacenter consideration as it increases infrastructure cost. In both air and
immersion cooling, power draw is expected to increase substantially with higher operating frequencies. However, the
power efficiency improvements that are enabled by 2PIC can
partially offset this increase.
First, the static power of the processor reduces because it
operates at lower temperatures. To quantify this reduction,
we measured the temperature, power and performance for
the two processors in our large tank and compared them to
their air-cooled counterparts. Table III shows an improvement
of one frequency bin (3%, 100MHz) when we reduced the
temperature by 17-22°C. Keeping the same performance, we
can save 11W of static power per socket. Second, immersion
eliminates the need for fans and their power. In our Open
Compute server, this represents 42W (6%) (Table I). Third,
the peak PUE is reduced from 1.20 in evaporative-cooled
datacenters to 1.03 in 2PIC. This is a reduction of 14% in
total datacenter power. For our 700W servers, this represents
a saving of 118W (= 700 × 1.20 × 0.14) per server. Putting
all these saving together, we can reduce around 182W (= 2
× 11W for static, 42W for the fans, and 118W in PUE) per
server. These gains can alleviate a substantial portion of the

increased power of overclocking.
Despite the power efficiency gains from 2PIC, we cannot
overclock indiscriminately because doing so might result in
hitting limits in the power delivery infrastructure of the datacenter. This problem is exacerbated by the power oversubscription initiatives undertaken by cloud providers for improving
the power utilization of their datacenters [22], [38], [62],
[70]. Overclocking in oversubscribed datacenters increases the
chance of hitting limits and triggering power capping mechanisms. These mechanisms (e.g., Intel RAPL [18]) rely on CPU
frequency reduction and memory bandwidth throttling and
therefore might offset any performance gains from overclocking. Hence, providers must perform overclocking carefully.
For example, providers can overclock during periods of power
underutilization in datacenters due to workload variability and
diurnal patterns exhibited by long-running workloads. In addition, they can use workload-priority-based capping [38], [62],
[70] to minimize the impact on critical/overclocked workloads
when power limits are breached due to overclocking.
Takeaway 1: Overclocking increases power consumption
substantially. However, immersion cooling provides power
savings that partially offset the higher power requirements.
Lifetime. Increasing the operating frequency and consequently
voltage can reduce the lifetime of electronics. However, immersion can compensate for the lifetime reduction with lower
junction temperatures. To quantify the lifetime at different
operating conditions, we obtained a 5nm composite processor
model from a large fabrication company. Table IV summarizes
the three lifetime degradation processes that are included in
the model and govern lifetime: (1) gate oxide breakdown, (2)
electro-migration, and (3) thermal cycling. These processes are
time-dependent and accelerate the lifetime reduction. We also
show their dependent parameters: junction temperature, temperature variance, and voltage. Overclocking and immersion
affect these parameters substantially.
The model shows an exponential relationship between temperature, voltage, and lifetime, which is consistent with prior
research [19], [42], [69], [72]. The company has validated
the model through accelerated testing, which accounts for
the impact of the three lifetime degradation processes as
a function of workload, voltage, current, temperature, and
thermal stress. This testing covers the useful lifetime (∼5
years) of servers, before they are decommissioned. We use
the model to calculate the temperature, power, and voltage at
which electronics maintain the same predicted lifetime.
Table V shows the processor lifetime estimation for running

a server in air and 2PIC, at nominal and overclocked frequencies. Our air-cooled baseline runs at nominal frequency,
junction temperature of 85°C, and an expected lifetime of 5
years. The operating voltage and performance are based on the
experimental voltage curve obtained from the overclockable
Xeon W-3175X, which showed that to get from 205W to
305W, we would need to increase the voltage from 0.90V
to 0.98V. With this power and voltage increase, we could
get 23% higher frequency (compared to all-core turbo). By
evaluating the model at these operating conditions, we estimate
the expected processor lifetime for each configuration.
If we were to run the overclocked 305W processor in air,
the junction temperature would increase to 101°C and the
projected lifetime would be less than a year. In FC-3284,
running at the nominal power (205W) results in a junction
temperature of 66°C and more than 10 years expected lifetime.
Running overclocked will increase temperatures to 74°C and
lifetime would drop to approximately 4 years. By using HFE7000, junction temperatures can be lowered to 51°C in the
nominal case and 63°C when overclocking. Interestingly, when
overclocking with this liquid, the lifetime matches the aircooled baseline (5 years).
Finally, the model for predicting lifetime assumes worstcase utilization. Therefore, moderately-utilized servers will
accumulate lifetime credit. Such servers can be overclocked
beyond the 23% frequency boost for added performance, but
the extent and duration of this additional overclocking has to
be balanced against the impact on lifetime. To this end, we are
working with component manufacturers to provide wear-out
counters with their parts that can be used to trade-off between
overclocking and lifetime.
Takeaway 2: Immersion cooling can compensate for the
lifetime degradation due to overclocking, and thus paves the
way for new server operating conditions and trade-offs.
Computational stability. Excessive overclocking may induce
bitflips due to aggressive circuit timing and sudden voltage
drops. Bitflips can cause applications to crash or produce erroneous results (silent errors). Fortunately, processors already
implement error correction to protect against high-energy
particle strikes. All processor results and cache accesses are
verified, and bit errors are corrected whenever possible [32].
Through a period of 6 months of very aggressive overclocking, we logged the number of correctable errors for the two
overclocking platforms and we saw no errors in small tank
#1 and 56 CPU cache errors in small tank #2. Whenever
possible, we also verified the computation results to detect any

silent errors and we did not observe any. The server would
ungracefully crash though whenever we excessively pushed
the voltage and frequency. It was unclear if the crashes were
caused by voltage control or timing issues.
In contrast, our experience indicates that overclocking frequencies 23% higher than all-core turbo was stable and did
not run into the risk of correctable or uncorrectable errors. In
general, overclocking has to be balanced against computational
stability, and can be accomplished, for example, by monitoring
the rate of change in correctable errors. To this end, we are
working with component manufacturers to define maximum
overclocking frequencies for their parts to avoid computational
instability, and monitor the relevant counters for safety.
Takeaway 3: Computational stability is unaffected for moderate increases in frequency and voltage, but excessive
overclocking can potentially affect stability and needs to be
carefully managed.
Environmental impact. If overclocking does produce an
overall increase in energy consumption, it could be a source
of CO2. However, datacenters are expected to be powered
primarily from renewable sources [6], [26], [45].
In terms of water usage, we have simulated the amount of
water and project that the Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE)
will be at par with evaporative-cooled datacenters.
Our two liquids have a high global warming impact potential
(other liquids have lower potential, but we have not yet
experimented with them). To minimize vapor loss from the
fluids, we seal the tanks. However, large load variations and
server servicing can cause vapor to escape. To tackle this
issue, we implement mechanical and chemical systems that
trap vapor both at the tank level and at the facility level.
Takeaway 4: Although overclocking might consume more
energy, renewables and careful vapor management can enable environmentally-friendly overclocking at scale.
TCO. We worked with several teams across Azure on a
complete TCO analysis of a 2PIC datacenter. The analysis
compares an air-cooled datacenter with a non-overclockable
and an overclockable 2PIC datacenter. It includes all costs:
IT, datacenter construction, energy, operations, and taxes and
fees. These factors are the same as those from prior work [12],
[17], [37]. We compare the TCO for the different options in
terms of cost per physical core as a metric of sellable capacity
for cloud providers, including Azure.
The air-cooled baseline is a direct-evaporative hyperscale
datacenter with Azure’s latest server generation. The 2PIC datacenter includes additional costs for servers (e.g., related to the
ability to overclock them), tanks and fluid for immersion, and
the costs to design a 2PIC datacenter (including mechanical
and electrical infrastructures). We also include the redundancy
costs (e.g., power and networking) for iso-availability with the
air-cooled baseline, and account for the average energy costs
from overclocking.

confidentiality; the contribution of the different factors towards
the baseline’s TCO is similar to that from prior work [12],
[17], [24], [37]. Although using 2PIC adds costs for tanks and
liquid, they are easily offset by the savings. In terms of cost
per physical core, non-overclockable 2PIC datacenters are 7%
cheaper than air-cooled ones. These savings primarily come
from 2PIC lowering the datacenter PUE by 14% (Table I),
which enables using the reclaimed power towards adding
more servers and thereby amortizing costs (e.g., construction,
operations, energy) across more cores. In addition, there are
server cost savings from eliminating fans and other server
materials (e.g., sheet metal). Network cost increases with 2PIC
because of the additional servers.
Even overclockable 2PIC datacenters reduce TCO by 4%,
when compared to the air-cooled baseline. In comparison to
non-overclockable 2PIC, the capability to overclock increases
the cost per physical core by 3% for two reasons. First,
the power delivery infrastructure needs to be upgraded to
support the higher server power requirements from overclocking. These upgrades negate the server cost savings obtained
by switching from air-cooled to non-overclockable 2PIC.
Second, overclocking increases energy cost. For our TCO
analysis, we conservatively assume that overclocking always
adds the maximum 200W of power to each server (100W
per socket), and this translates to a ∼30% increase in server
power and energy consumption over non-overclockable 2PIC.
This increased energy consumption brings the energy cost of
overclockable 2PIC back to that of the air-cooled baseline.
Finally, overclockable 2PIC provides cost savings when
overclocking is used for oversubscription of servers. Section V
describes the oversubscription use-case and the TCO impact
of this use-case is presented in Section VI-C.
Takeaway 5: Immersion cooling enables using overclocking
and can provide up to 7% reduction in cost per physical core
in comparison to air-cooled datacenters.
Performance. Finally, the performance impact of overclocking
depends on the workload-bounding resource. For example,
overclocking the CPU running a memory-bound workload will
not result in much improvement in performance. Similarly,
overclocking the memory when the bottleneck is the CPU will
be fruitless. The problem of which component to overclock
and when is even harder for cloud providers because they have
little or no knowledge of the workloads running inside the
VMs. As we describe in Section V, counter-based models can

be used by providers to predict the impact of overclocking on
a VM’s workload. We also evaluate the impact of overclocking
on different workloads in detail in Section VI-B.
Final takeaway: Despite the thermal benefits of immersion,
providers must carefully use overclocking to provide performance benefits when they are achievable, while managing
the associated risks and costs.
V. OVERCLOCKING USE-CASES IN DATACENTERS
This section describes use-cases for overclocking to reduce
the cloud provider’s costs and/or enhance customer experience.
Section VI evaluates several of these use-cases.
2PIC allows operating servers at higher frequencies, compared to air-based cooling. Figure 5(a) and (b) illustrate this
difference for CPUs. Figure 5(a) shows that Turbo is the
maximum operating frequency of air-cooled CPUs; anything
beyond it is restricted due to thermal constraints. In contrast,
immersion cooling provides two higher frequency bands for
operating CPUs as in Figure 5(b). There is no lifetime reduction when operating the CPUs in the green band. For our
Skylake processor in HFE-7000, operating in this band means
up to 23% higher frequency, with the same expected lifetime
as the air-cooled counterpart. CPUs can also operate in the red
band (> 25% frequency increase) with some lifetime impact.
By carefully managing the associated risks (Section IV),
we can use the additional frequency bands to: (1) offer highperformance VMs to customers, (2) improve packing density
of VMs on servers, (3) reduce capacity buffers in datacenters,
(4) mitigate capacity crises in datacenters, and (5) augment
VM auto-scaling solutions for enhanced customer experience.
Below, we describe these use-cases taking CPU overclocking
as an example. Overclocking other components also applies.
High-performance VMs. Cloud providers today offer VMs
with Turbo Boost support [9], [49]. However, with the ability
to overclock, a provider could offer new high-performance
VM classes that run at even higher frequencies. For example,
Figure 5(c) shows a high-performance VM1 running in the
green band, while the regular VM2 runs at the base speed.
Furthermore, VM1 may opportunistically run at frequencies
in the red band. However, the decision of when to operate in
the red band and for how long requires the provider to trade-off
between performance and the risks described in Section IV.
Dense VM packing. Providers use multi-dimensional bin
packing to place VMs on servers [28]. To cut costs, they

can increase VM packing density (VMs/server ratio) and
thereby reduce the number of servers required. Even a single
percentage point in tighter VM packing equates to hundreds
of millions of dollars in savings for large cloud providers like
Azure [28]. However, the potential for performance impact
on VMs limits the provider’s ability to increase VM packing
density. The provider must place VMs so that they are unlikely
to need the same resources at the same time.
When this rare scenario occurs, providers can use overclocking to mitigate it. Figure 5(d) shows an example where,
through CPU oversubscription using overclocking, we can
assign three VMs to the server, in contrast to Figure 5(a) where
we could only assign two. Any performance loss that would
be caused by oversubscription would then be compensated by
overclocking. Importantly, this combination of techniques can
only be used selectively, because (1) providers are only willing
to oversubscribe third-party VMs when their customers are
aware of it; (2) VMs often live long lifespans [16], so overclocking could be needed for long periods. To side-step the
latter issue, overclocking could be used simply as a stop-gap
solution to performance loss until live VM migration (which
is a resource-hungry and lengthy operation) can eliminate the
problem completely.
Buffer reduction. Providers typically reserve capacity
(buffers) for events such as a service failover due to infrastructure failures. Upon such an event, any VMs affected by the
failure get re-created on the reserve capacity. However, these
events are rare and usually do not last long, so the buffers
are unused or underutilized most of the time. The left side of
Figure 6 illustrates the buffer in the air-cooled capacity being
used only as a result of failures. For clarity, we illustrate the
buffer as comprising full servers but it can also be spread
across (partially filled) servers.
The provider can use overclocking to replace these static
buffers with virtual ones. As the immersion cooling part of
Figure 6 shows, during normal operation, it can use all the
capacity to run VMs. Upon failure, it can re-create the affected
VMs and overclock the servers that host them.
Capacity crisis mitigation. Providers build new datacenters
based on demand forecasts. This capacity planning is often
challenging because of supply-demand mismatches, such as
construction delays, equipment shortages, incorrect forecasts.

A shortage in supply leads to customers being denied service
until the additional servers are deployed. Figure 7 shows an
example where the provider incorrectly predicted the demand
and ended up with a capacity gap (red area). To bridge the
gap, it can use overclocking to get more VMs deployed on
to its existing infrastructure, assuming enough other resources
(especially memory and storage space) are available.
Overclocking-enhanced auto-scaling. Providers offer solutions for auto-scaling the number of VMs in a deployment
according to user-provided rules [7], [48]. For example, the
user may specify that a new VM should be added (scale-out)
if the average CPU utilization over the last 5 minutes exceeds
50%. Similarly, she may specify that, if average utilization is
lower than 20% for the past 10 minutes, then one VM should
be removed (scale-in). Although CPU utilization is the most
common metric for auto-scaling, some users specify others like
memory utilization, thread count, or queue length. In general,
these metrics act as proxies for the application-level metrics
that the user cares about (e.g., tail latency).
However, scaling out is expensive today, as it may take
tens of seconds to even minutes to deploy new VMs [4].
This scale-out overhead could impose a performance penalty
on the application. Consequently, users typically set lower
thresholds to start scaling out before the VMs are actually
needed. Although providers have started predicting surges in
load and scaling out proactively [8], the time required for
scaling out can still impact application performance.
Providers can use VM deployment overclocking to mitigate
the performance impact of scaling-out. Overclocking essentially scales-up the existing VM(s), while the new VM(s) are
being deployed. Once the scale-out completes, all the VMs
can be scaled-down to their regular frequency. Temporarily
scaling-up and down is effective because changing frequencies
only takes tens of μs [43], which is much faster than scaling
out. Figure 8(a) illustrates the process of temporarily scalingup a VM (from time t1 to t2) to hide the scale-out overhead;
the VM is scaled-down after the scale-out completes.
As a variant of this use-case, overclocking can also postpone

or even obviate the need for scaling out. Since changing
clock frequencies typically impacts CPU utilization [51], the
provider can scale-up VMs to keep the utilization below the
user-specified scale-out threshold. The scale-up has to occur
at a lower threshold than the scale-out. Figure 8(b) illustrates
the process of scaling-up (at time t1) and preventing the scaleout altogether. For this approach to work in practice, the
provider should model [51] the impact of frequency change
on utilization. This step is crucial because overclocking VMs
indiscriminately will increase the power consumption, could
impact component lifetime, and might not even provide any reduction in utilization (Section IV). To track changing loads, the
provider can periodically monitor the impact of overclocking
on utilization and adjust the frequency (increase or decrease)
accordingly. Finally, if overclocking is not enough, the scaleout rule will trigger when the CPU utilization crosses the
higher threshold.
VI. EVALUATION
This section evaluates the use-cases from Section V. We
start by describing our experimental setup and the representative cloud applications that we use for evaluation. Then, we
study the benefits of component overclocking for applications
running on high-performance VMs. Next, we evaluate using
overclocking for enhancing the packing of VMs on servers
and estimate the packing ratio at which the VM performance
is not degraded. These results directly apply to the buffer
reduction and capacity crisis mitigation use-cases. Finally, we
present the design of our overclocking-enhanced auto-scaler
and evaluate its benefits. Throughout this section, we also
project on potential efficiencies at scale.
A. Experimental environment
Servers. We use the servers in small tanks #1 and #2 (Section II). Both servers have 128 GB DDR4 memory. Small tank
#1 has the Xeon W-3175X processor with a 255W TDP. Small
tank #2 has an Intel i9900k processor and a Nvidia 2080ti
(250W TDP) GPU. Both servers run Windows Server 2019
Datacenter edition with Hyper-V enabled for virtualization.
We perform all experiments with small tank #1, except for the
GPU overclocking ones which we perform with tank #2.
Frequency configurations. We configure the two systems
with different frequencies for every component. Table VII
shows the seven configurations of tank #1 that overclock
the core, uncore, and system memory. We include: (1) two
production baseline configurations (B1 and B2) where we

most datacenters today); (2) two configurations where we
independently overclock the memory and uncore, including
the last-level cache (B3 and B4); and (3) three configurations
where we overclock combinations of all components (OC1-3).
Table VIII shows the configurations and the knobs for GPU
overclocking. Here we include: (1) one baseline with turbo
enabled; and (2) three configurations where we progressively
overclock more GPU sub-components (OCG1-3).
Applications. Table IX describes the applications (5 in-house
and 6 publicly-available) that we use, the number of cores
that each application needs, and the metric of interest for the
application. The top nine applications represent those that are
commonly run in the cloud, whereas the bottom two help us
evaluate the impact of GPU and memory overclocking.
B. High-performance VMs
This section evaluates the use-case where providers offer
high-performance VMs by overclocking the processor, memory, and/or GPU.
Overclocking for cloud applications. Figure 9 shows the
impact of overclocking on the metric of the interest and
average and 99th-percentile (P99) server power draw. We run
only one instance of each application in isolation. For the six
applications on the left of the figure, a lower metric of interest
is better; for the two applications on the right, higher is better.
In all configurations, overclocking improves the metric of
interest, enhancing performance from 10% to 25%. Core overclocking (OC1) provides the most benefit, with the exception
of TeraSort and DiskSpeed. However, it also considerably
increases the P99 power draw in a few cases. Cache overclocking (OC2) accelerates Pmbench and DiskSpeed, while incurring only marginal power overheads. Memory overclocking
(OC3) improves performance slightly for four applications and
significantly for memory-bound SQL. In all cases, memory
overclocking substantially increases the power draw.
BI illustrates the importance of careful overclocking at
scale. Although OC1 improves performance substantially with
reasonable power penalty, overclocking other components increases the power draw without offering any performance gain.
Training has a predictable access pattern, so the prefetcher can
timely bring data blocks into the L1 cache. Thus, a faster cache
or memory does not improve its performance significantly.
Memory overclocking for streaming applications. We
further evaluate the impact of memory overclocking using
STREAM [44] and the configurations from Table VII. We
measure the sustainable memory bandwidth and the computation rate for four kernels: (1) copy, (2) scale, (3) add, and (4)
triad. Figure 10 shows the bandwidths and power draws.
The highest performance improvement happens when the
memory system is overclocked: B4 and OC3 achieve 17% and
24% improvements compared to B1, respectively. Increasing
core and cache frequencies also has a positive impact on the
peak memory bandwidth, as memory requests are served faster.
As expected, the power draw increases with the aggressiveness
of overclocking (10% average power increase).
GPU overclocking for machine learning training. We evaluate the impact of GPU overclocking using VGG [58] on
PyTorch [54]. We train 6 CNN models and the input sizes fit
entirely in the GPU’s memory. Figure 11 shows the normalized
execution time and absolute power for the 6 VGG models
when overclocked using the configurations from Table VIII.
We observe that the execution time decreases by up to
15%, which is proportional to the frequency increase. We
also see that increasing voltage, power, and frequency all help
performance. However, for the most recent batch-optimized
model VGG16B, overclocking is beneficial only to a certain extent; OCG2 (with GPU memory overclocking) offers
marginal improvements over OCG1, and further GPU memory
overclocking with OCG3 provides no additional improvement.
Worse, the P99 power draw increases by 9.5% between
OCG1 and OCG3, while offering little to no performance
improvement. Overall, the P99 power draw during these runs
was 231W, up from 193W for the baseline runs (+19%).
Summary. Our results indicate that applications can benefit
from the overclocking of all components. However, providers
must be careful to increase frequencies for only the bottleneck
components, to avoid unnecessary power overheads.
C. Dense VM packing via oversubscription
In this section, we study using overclocking to mitigate the
interference induced by core oversubscription in tank #1. We
run experiments with latency-sensitive VMs only, and with a
mix of latency-sensitive and batch workload VMs.
Latency-sensitive VMs only. We run 4 instances of SQL on
4 VMs, where each VM has 4 virtual cores (vcores for short).
With no oversubscription, we would assign 16 physical cores
(pcores) to run the 16 vcores across the 4 VMs. To study
the impact of oversubscription, we vary the number of pcores
assigned to run the VMs from 8 (50% oversubscription) to 16
(no oversubscription). To quantify the benefit of overclocking,

we study server configurations B2 and OC3 from Table VII.
Figure 12 shows the average P95 latencies.
As one would expect, the average P95 latency decreases
as we increase the pcore count. Crucially, the latency for the
best case of 16-pcore B2 is comparable (within 1%) to OC3
with 12 pcores. This means that we can save 4 pcores with
overclocking, while providing the same level of performance
as B2. These 4 pcores become available to run additional VMs.
In terms of power draw (with any inactive pcores in lowpower idle state), the baseline with 12 and 16 pcores running
SQL consumes on average 120W and 130W and at P99 126W
and 140W, respectively. With 12 and 16 active pcores under
OC3, the server consumes on average 160W and 173W, and
at P99 169W and 180W, respectively. Given that the core
and uncore frequencies both have increased by 20%, these
increases (29%–33%) in power draw are expected.
Batch and latency-sensitive VMs. Table X shows three
scenarios with two latency-sensitive (SQL and SPECJBB)
and two batch applications (BI and TeraSort). Each scenario
requires a total of 20 pcores, but we assign only 16 pcores
(20% oversubscription). We run these three scenarios with the
same two configurations (B2 and OC3). Figure 13 shows the
improvement to the metric of interest for each application,
compared to a baseline with the requisite number of pcores
(20) under the B2 configuration.
In all the cases, oversubscribing the baseline by 20% (yellow bars) causes performance degradation. This shows that this

oversubscription level under B2 has a negative performance
impact. Latency-sensitive applications like SQL and SPECJBB
suffer the highest degradation. In contrast, when we increase
the core and uncore frequencies under OC3 (blue bars), all
workloads show improvements of up to 17%. In fact, all of
them improve by at least 6% compared to the baseline, except
for TeraSort in Scenario 1.
TCO impact of denser VM packing. As we see above,
overclocking can enable denser packing via oversubscription.
To quantify the TCO impact of this, we assume using overclocking with 10% oversubscription of physical cores, which
would leverage the stranded memory on Azure’s servers.
For this analysis, we quantify the TCO per virtual core.
We obtain the cost per virtual core with no oversubscription
from the TCO analysis in Section IV, which assumes a 1:1
mapping between virtual and physical cores. Oversubscription
of 10% in overclockable 2PIC would reduce the TCO per
virtual core by 13% when compared to air-cooled ones. In
fact, oversubscription also benefits non-overclockable 2PIC –
it would reduce TCO by ∼10% since it amortizes overall costs
across 10% more virtual cores.
Summary. Oversubscription using overclocking frees up cores
that providers can use to run more VMs on the same hardware.
Such oversubscription would reduce the cost per virtual core
for Azure by 13%.
D. Overclocking-enhanced auto-scaling
We first describe a model to determine the impact of
frequency change on CPU utilization. Our auto-scaler implementation uses this model to determine if (and by how much)
scaling-up is beneficial. Next, we validate the model in the
context of auto-scaling and then present the results for how
overclocking improves auto-scaling.
Performance and utilization model. Our auto-scaler should
carefully use overclocking for scaling-up because not all
workloads (e.g., memory-bound) will benefit from running at
high CPU frequencies. We need a low-overhead mechanism
for this because expensive models will prolong the impact on
affected workloads. To this end, our auto-scaler uses a simple

yet effective model proposed in [51]. This model uses two
per-core architecture-independent counters called Aperf and
Pperf . Aperf counts how many cycles the core is active and
running. Pperf is similar to Aperf , except that it does not
count cycles when the active core is stalled because of some
dependency (e.g., memory access). The model estimates the
impact of frequency change from F0 to F1 on the current

Overclocking-enhanced auto-scaler architecture and setup.
Figure 14 shows the architecture of our overclocking-enabled
auto-scaler. Clients send their requests to the load balancer
and the server VMs respond to the requests. The auto-scaler
decides when VMs must be added (scale-out) or removed
(scale-in). To do so, it considers the average CPU utilization
of the server VMs over the last 3 minutes (to avoid noise).
It also decides when to change the frequency of server VMs
(scale-up or down) using the average CPU utilization and the
performance counters collected over the last 30 seconds. It
makes these decisions every 3 seconds, based on the telemetry
(i.e., Aperf , Pperf , and U tilt) collected from the VMs. For
scaling-up or down, the auto-scaler uses Equation 1 to find
the minimum frequency, from the supported range of the
processor, that keeps the average CPU utilization of VMs
below or above the threshold, respectively.
We use the Client-Server application (Table IX) for our
experiments. The client request arrivals are Markovian, the
service times follow a General distribution, and there are k
servers (i.e., VMs). We run all the VMs in the Xeon server in
tank #1. The threshold for scaling-out is 50% CPU utilization
and 20% for scaling-in. To emulate the behavior of a real
scale-out operation (e.g., impact of network traffic), we make
scaling-out in our system take 60 seconds. Scaling in or out is

done by 1 VM at a time. We also set the scale-up and scaledown thresholds to 40% and 20%, respectively. The frequency
range for scaling up or down is 3.4 GHz (B2) to 4.1 GHz
(OC1), divided into 8 frequency bins; no other components
are overclocked.
Model validation. To validate our model (Equation 1), we
configure the auto-scaler to bring the utilization just below
the scale-up threshold when this threshold is exceeded. We
also configure it for scale-up/down only, i.e. no scale-out/in.
We then launch three server VMs and adjust the client load
every 5 minutes to 1000, 2000, 500, 3000, and 1000 queries
per second (QPS). Figure 15 shows the CPU utilization over
time with our auto-scaler and a baseline that does not change
frequencies. The secondary y-axis shows the frequency as a
percentage of the frequency range between B2 and OC1.
As the figure shows, once the CPU utilization exceeds
40%, the auto-scaler increases the frequency in steps until the
utilization is under the threshold. As soon as the first peak
ends (time 200 seconds), the auto-scaler scales down to the
lowest frequency. For the second peak, the auto-scaler scalesup sharply to the maximum frequency to adjust to the client
load. However, the utilization stays higher than the scale-out
threshold, which would imply a scale-out invocation.
Note that every time we increase the frequency, the utilization decreases. This shows that our model predicts correctly;
otherwise, we would see ineffective frequency changes or
missed utilization targets. The reason it might take more than
one frequency adjustment to bring the utilization below the
threshold is that the utilization the auto-scaler sees is averaged
over the last 30 seconds. In other words, the average might run
behind the actual utilization during quick increases in load.
Overclocking-enhanced auto-scaler results. In the above
experiments, we turned off scale-out/in in our auto-scaler.
Now, we evaluate it with both scale-up/down and scale-out/in.
We run three configurations: (1) baseline (B2 in Table VII);
(2) OC-E, which scales up straight to OC1 frequency when
the scale-out threshold is crossed, i.e. there are no scale-

up/down thresholds); and (3) OC-A, which tries to keep the
utilization below the scale-up threshold to delay/avoid scaleout. We again start one server VM. For the client load, we start
with 500 QPS and increase the load by steps of 500 every 5
minutes up to a maximum of 4000 QPS.
Figure 16 shows the CPU utilization with the three autoscaler configurations over time. At time t1 load increases,
forcing all three systems to scale out one VM to reduce the
load. However, comparing OC-E and OC-A to the baseline,
we can see that (1) their utilization does not reach 70% as it
does for the baseline, and (2) the utilization drops faster (time
t2) because of their higher frequency.
The advantage of OC-A over OC-E first appears at t3, when
OC-E and baseline must add one VM while OC-A manages
the utilization increase by scaling up. The fact that OC-A is
running with one fewer VM is the reason its utilization reaches
a higher peak than the other systems at t4. A similar pattern
repeats between t4 and t6. During the rest of the execution,
the load is so high that all systems are forced to scale out.
Table XI summarizes the results. The application’s P95
latency improves by 42% and 54% for OC-E and OC-A,
respectively, compared to the baseline. This is because when
the client load increases, overclocking makes the existing
server VMs run faster (as evident from the reduction in
utilization in Figure 16) and thereby mitigates the performance
impact. Additionally, the baseline and OC-E scale-out to 6
VMs, whereas scaling-up to prevent scale-out with OC-A
helps reduce the number of VMs needed to 5. OC-A produces
a savings of 0.25 VM×hours (11% compared to the baseline)
for the user, and less capacity consumed for the cloud provider.
For the provider, overclocking also results in a higher power
draw by the server VMs. On average, the power draw of the
server VMs increases by 7% with OC-E and 27% with OC-A
over the baseline.
Summary. Overclocking-enhanced auto-scaling provides
users with significant performance and cost improvements, by
hiding the overhead of VM scale-out or reducing the number
of VMs that need to be created.
VII. RELATED WORK
Our work is the first to explore the benefits of 2PIC in
terms of overclocking (and its risks). We are also the first to
propose and evaluate many overclocking scenarios for cloud
providers. Nevertheless, prior works on advanced cooling,
processor speed boosting, and power management are related.
Advanced cooling. Liquid cooling has been used to improve
performance and power efficiency. For example, Google uses
cold plates for its power-hungry TPUs [52], whereas Alibaba
uses 1PIC to improve datacenter PUE [74]. Section II compares 2PIC to these technologies.
Other technologies, such as two-phase cold plates [61]
and microfluidic cooling [63] have been proposed as well.
The former combines 2PIC and cold plates: liquid circulates
directly over hot components but boiling takes place within the
cold plates. In the latter, sub-micrometer channels are carved
between electrical paths and cold fluid circulates through
them. We argue that 2PIC provides a better combination of
effectiveness and design simplicity; it achieves similar or better
cooling capabilities than its counterparts.
Increasing processor speed. Researchers have proposed computational sprinting, which uses phase-change materials, such
as wax, to enhance the heat removal from processors [59],
[60]. They studied a combination of running cores at higher
frequencies and increasing the number of active cores for short
periods (several minutes) until the material melts.
Other works have proposed similar approaches [13], [21],
[30], [35], [36], [40], [50]. Autotune [40] enhances Turbo
Boost [33] based on the observation that if any resource
interference occurs, increasing frequency might be harmful
and waste power. Paceline [27] uses an overclocked leader
thread and an underclocked checker thread for execution. The
leader aids execution through data prefetching and resolving
branch outcomes, and the checker ensures correctness in the
face of any errors introduced by overclocking. Cooperative
boosting [56] studies the interaction of higher frequency, turbo,
and temperature on system performance.
Esprint [14] and SprintCon [73] investigate computational
sprinting under QoS constraints. Adrenaline [29] targets improving tail latency by boosting the processor speed for those
tasks that slow down the system the most.
Overall, these works are generally limited to speeding up
CPUs and only to turbo frequency. Given the limitations of
their cooling systems, this boost can only last for short periods.
Moreover, they have not studied the consequences and risks of
operating in the overclocking domain. Being able to overclock
for longer periods, while trading off against consequences and
risks, enables many new opportunities (for performance, QoS,
and capacity management) that we unearth in this paper.
Power capping and management. Power capping is used in
datacenters for power safety [22], [38], [39], [62], [70]. These
mechanisms typically rely on frequency reduction (opposite
of overclocking) to manage power when it approaches circuit
breaker limits. To reduce the impact of capping on critical
workloads, prior works have proposed workload-priority-based

capping [38], [39], [62], [70]. These works are complementary
and can be used to mitigate the performance impact of capping
even on servers with overclocked components.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we explored the use of liquid cooling and
component overclocking by public cloud providers. We argued
that 2PIC is the most promising technology and built three
tanks to demonstrate it. We also proposed many scenarios
for 2PIC-enabled overclocking, and discussed its benefits and
risks. Our experimental evaluation studied overclocking in
three scenarios, including as a performance-enhancing feature
coupled with VM auto-scaling. We conclude that two-phase
immersion and overclocking have enormous potential for nextgeneration cloud platforms.
