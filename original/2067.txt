We present a Material Point Method for visual simulation of baking breads,
cookies, pancakes and similar materials that consist of dough or batter
(mixtures of water, flour, eggs, fat, sugar and leavening agents). We develop a
novel thermomechanical model using mixture theory to resolve interactions
between individual water, gas and dough species. Heat transfer with thermal
expansion is used to model thermal variations in material properties. Waterbased mass transfer is resolved through the porous mixture, gas represents
carbon dioxide produced by leavening agents in the baking process and
dough is modeled as a viscoelastoplastic solid to represent its varied and
complex rheological properties. Water content in the mixture reduces during
the baking process according to Fick’s Law which contributes to drying and
cracking of crust at the material boundary. Carbon dioxide gas produced by
leavening agents during baking creates internal pressure that causes rising.
The viscoelastoplastic model for the dough is temperature dependent and
is used to model melting and solidification. We discretize the governing
equations using a novel Material Point Method designed to track the solid
phase of the mixture.

1 INTRODUCTION
Whether it is bread rising in the oven, cookies oozing with melting
chocolate chips, or a pancake sizzling in a pan, baking and cooking
are integral parts of our everyday lives. It is therefore important and
yet challenging to model these phenomena accurately when creating compelling virtual scenes for computer graphics applications.
Famously, Shah [2007] demonstrated the compelling nature of food
dynamics in Pixar’s Ratatouille. Surprisingly, given our everyday familiarity, these processes involve a wide range of complex physical
phenomena including heat and mass transfer [Broyart and Trystram
2002; Nicolas et al. 2014], viscous and elastic rheology [Faridi and
Faubion 2012], dynamics of porous mixtures [Debaste et al. 2010;
Sakin-Yilmazer et al. 2013] and many more. We develop a model and
numerical methods that can capture some of the most characteristic visual aspects of the baking or general cooking process, such

as melting, dehydrating, rising, and gelatinization. Furthermore,
our approach allows for realistic simulation of user interactions
like breaking and folding of the materials at various stages in the
cooking process.
We propose a porous thermo-viscoelastoplastic mixture model.
Melting effects are captured by a temperature-based change in viscoelastoplastic constitutive laws. During the cooking process water
diffuses through the surface of the material according to Fick’s law.
This allows for effects such as wrinkling and curling of dehydrated
fruit, as well as cracking of the top of baked goods [Thorvaldsson
and Skjöldebrand 1998]. Leavening agents are often a predominant
source of rising in baked goods, and we focus on the effects of
chemical leaveners like baking powder and baking soda. With these
agents, carbon dioxide (CO2) is created through a chemical reaction,
which then expands under heat to help the dough to rise [Nicolas
et al. 2014; Zhang and Datta 2006]; this reaction is activated at the
critical temperature, peaks as temperature rises and finally gets
deactivated when it goes beyond a threshold. Our model keeps track
of the CO2 creation to capture the rising effect in baking. At the
final stage of the baking process, flour gelatinization takes place and
the baked goods become much more elastic and less viscous than
the initial dough or batter [Vanin et al. 2009]. This is achieved in
our model with temperature-dependent plasticity. We demonstrate
these abilities with baking, tearing and dehydrating examples.
While dough and batter are mixtures of constituents that include
water, leavening agents, flour, eggs, fat, sugar and others, we model
the non-water or non-CO2 agents as a single phase in a three species
mixture model. CO2 from leavening agents and water make up
the other two species in the mixture. We refer to the mixture of
non-water and non-CO2 species as the solid phase and model it as
viscoelastoplastic with parameters that vary with temperature. This
allows us to address rheological changes induced by cooking that
do not arise from the effects of the leavening agents or water-based
mass transfer. It is a simplification, but we confidently make it as
it reduces the modeling complexity without precluding important
features like melting and solidification.
We discretize our model with a novel Material Point Method
[Sulsky et al. 1994] designed to treat thermomechanical porous
mixtures and temperature dependent chemical production of gas
from leavening agents. Our approach is designed to track the solid
phase (everything but the water and CO2) since it is most apparent
for visual rendering. Various MPM approaches have treated porous
mixtures of water, gas and solid species [Abe et al. 2014; Bandara
et al. 2016; Bandara and Soga 2015; Gao et al. 2018a; Jassim et al.
2013; Tampubolon et al. 2017; Yerro et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2009].
Tampubolon et al. [2018a; 2017] use two sets of material points to
track distinct water and sand phases. This allows for detailed visual
resolution of each phase, but it is costly since each phase must be
treated with a separate grid and their interactions are resolved via a
stiff interaction term. Our approach is similar to [Abe et al. 2014;
Bandara et al. 2016; Yerro et al. 2015] in that they use one set of
material points and track relative motion of the other species. However, these works only considered mixtures of soil, water and air,
largely for landslide applications. While there are some similarities
in the treatment of porosity, none have considered thermal effects

in the solid species as we do. Also, none have modeled gas pressures arising from temperature dependent chemical reactions. We
summarize our contributions as
• A thermo-viscoelastoplastic model of dough and batter that
approximates mixtures of non-water or CO2 contents, i.e.
ingredients like flour, egg, fat, sugar, etc.
• A three species porous mixture model of the water, CO2 and
remaining dough and batter contents.
• A model for the thermomechanical production of CO2 from
leavening agents and its influence on the viscoelastoplastic
rheology of the remaining materials in the solid phase.
• A novel MPM discretization of three species thermomechanical mixtures of solid, gas and water including the effects of
chemical production of CO2 from leavening agents.
2 PREVIOUS WORK
Many efforts have been made to study one or a few aspects of complicated food processes. Vanin et al. [2009] focus on the formation and
distinct texture of bread crust due to significantly lower water content than the crumb caused by rapid drying on the surface from the
heat of the oven. Guillard et al. [2004] model the moisture content
evolution in dry biscuit based on Fick’s second law [1855]. De Cindio
and Correra [1995] view a leavened dough as a viscoelastic homogeneous macrosystem but also a gas-paste microsystem to model the
interactions between the two phases during mixing, leavening and
baking. Zhang and Datta [2006] develop a coupled system of solid,
liquid water, water vapor and carbon dioxide phases to model the
bread baking process. They model the material as viscoelastic and
track the evolution of temperature, moisture, volume and surface
coloration during bread baking. Yang et al. [2017] develop a unified
particle framework for simulating various viscoelastic soft-matter
with phase changes using conservative Cahn-Hilliard advection.
They produce compelling simulations of phase transitions for cooking eggs and melting butter. Liu et al. [2015] use elastoplasticity

to simulate porous dehydration of fruits and other foods with the
Finite Element Method (FEM). Chen et al. [2019] proposed a datadriven model that predictively generates RGB images of dough
surface browning. Blutinger et al. [2019] studied the application of
laser-heating technology to browning dough.
Graphics applications have used mixture theory and multi-species
simulations to model porous water, sand and air mixtures [Gao
et al. 2018a; Liu et al. 2008; Tampubolon et al. 2017]. Many other
graphics applications have made compelling use of multi-species
simulations for water, sprays and foams [Losasso et al. 2008; Nielsen
and Osterby 2013; Takahashi et al. 2003; Yang et al. 2014], liquids
with bubbles [Mihalef et al. 2009; Ren et al. 2015; Thürey et al. 2007]
as well as for mixing of fluids [Bao et al. 2010; He et al. 2015; Kang
et al. 2010; Ren et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2015]. Various models and
numerical methods have been used to simulate realistic viscoelastic
and plastic material behaviors [Bargteil et al. 2007; Barreiro et al.
2017; Gerszewski et al. 2009; Goktekin et al. 2004; Müller et al. 2005;
Teschner et al. 2004; Wicke et al. 2010; Wojtan and Turk 2008] .
Heat transfer and viscoelastic melting have also been used in many
graphics applications to simulate visual effects of phase change and
melting [Carlson et al. 2002; Keiser et al. 2005; Losasso et al. 2006;
Maréchal et al. 2010; Müller et al. 2004; Terzopoulosi et al. 1991; Wei
et al. 2003; Zhao et al. 2006].
The Material Point Method (MPM) [1994] has been used in many
computer graphics applications, including snow [Stomakhin et al.
2013], non-Newtonian fluids and foams [Ram et al. 2015; Yue et al.
2015], heat transfer and phase change [Gao et al. 2018b; Stomakhin
et al. 2014], elastic and porous materials [Fei et al. 2018; Guo et al.
2018; Jiang et al. 2017a], and granular materials [Daviet and BertailsDescoubes 2016; Klár et al. 2016; Yue et al. 2018]. Various MPM
approaches have treated porous mixtures of different liquid, gas and
solid species. Bandara et al. [2014; 2016; 2015] simulate mixtures of
air, water and soil for landslide applications. In [Bandara and Soga
2015], they use two sets of Lagrangian marker particles for water
and soil respectively. Tampubolon et al. [2018a; 2017] use a similar
approach. In [Abe et al. 2014; Bandara et al. 2016], they use a single
set of material points for the soil and track the motion of the water
relative to the soil, but they neglect the water acceleration. Zhang
et al. [2009] also neglect the water acceleration terms. Yerro et al.
[2015] build on the two-phase porous MPM approach of Jassim et
al. [2013] to simulate three species mixtures of air, water and soil.
Bandara et al. [2015] use Biot’s [1941] phenomenological model for
their governing equations.
A few aspects of our approach are closely related to existing
MPM techniques. We treat thermal effects similar to Stomakhin et
al. [2014] and Gao et al. [2018b] and our treatment of multi-species
mixtures is similar to the one-species-centric formulations in [Abe
et al. 2014; Bandara et al. 2016; Bandara and Soga 2015; Yerro et al.
2015; Zhang et al. 2009]. Stomakhin et al. [2014] discretize the heat
equation for temperature using a finite difference approach and
use a Particle-In-Cell (PIC) [1964] transfer of thermal quantities
between particles and grid. Gao et al. [2018b] improved on this by
using an MPM style weak form discretization of the heat equation
where particles are used as quadrature points to avoid voxelization
associated with finite difference discretization. Furthermore, Gao
et al. use higher order PIC ([Jiang et al. 2017b]) transfers. We use a
Fig. 3. Cookies. The cookies are initialized as dough balls (top left). The
bottom left shows the end results. The top row from left to right varies with
decreasing amounts of leavener, and the bottom row from left to right with
decreasing oven temperature. The right column depicts the heat transfer
progress in the cookies during baking with color varying from blue to green
then to red with increasing temperature.
particle-based weak form derivation of the heat equation as in Gao
et al., however we use Fluid-Implicit-Particle (FLIP) [1986] transfers
rather than PIC transfers. Although FLIP transfers can suffer from
noise [Jiang et al. 2015], we found that it was not an issue for our
examples. Lastly, we note that we include the effects of thermal
expansion which neither Stomakhin et al. nor Gao et al. address.
Our approach, as with many other MPM approaches, use the notion of effective stress [Atkin and Craine 1976] with multi-species
mixtures. These approaches naturally admit MPM discretizations
where particles track each species, however stiff drag interaction
terms can require small time steps [Bandara and Soga 2015; Gao
et al. 2018a; Tampubolon et al. 2017]. Alternatively, we track the
motion of species relative to one set of particles. This is similar to
many formulations for porous soil in geomechanical applications
[Abe et al. 2014; Bandara et al. 2016; Bandara and Soga 2015; Yerro
et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2009]. However, none of these formulations
account for thermal effects that occur during baking. Furthermore,
most only account for water and soil mixtures. Only Yerro et al.
[2015] consider three species mixtures of soil, water and air. While
they discretize momentum balance relative to the mixture configuration, however, we do so relative to the solid phase which is easier
to track numerically.
3 GOVERNING EQUATIONS
We model our materials as a mixture of water, gas and solid constituents and use a multi-species continuum model to derive the
equations of motion from the governing physics [Atkin and Craine
1976]. With this assumption we use a different flow map for each
constituent which can then be combined to describe the kinematics
of the mixture. Formally, we use ϕ
α
: B0 × [0,T ] → R
3
to define
the motion of species α where α = w for water, α = s for solid

and α = д for gas. Here B0 ⊂ R

represents the configuration of
the material at time t = 0. We refer to points X ∈ B0 as material points and x ∈ B

as
world-space points where B

for Ω0 ⊂ B0 to denote subsets of the domains. Note that we do not
distinguish between different species in B0 since we assume they
are all present in the initial mixture. We further assume that the
motion of the gas relative to the solid is negligible, and that therefore
ϕ

(and B

= B

). We also assume that water may diffuse out
of the mixture, but that our mixture will never be completely dry.
With this assumption B

The Lagrangian velocity of each constituent is defined from the
flow map kinematics as V

(X,t) and the Eulerian
(or world-space) velocity is defined as v

where ϕ

(x,t) is the inverse flow map of the species α. This is the
standard relationship between Lagrangian and Eulerian representations, but done with respect to the individual species flow maps. We
use F
α
(X,t) =
∂ϕ
α
∂X
(X,t) to denote the Jacobian of the constituent
mappings (or deformation gradients) and J
α = det(F
α
) to denote
their determinants. Intuitively, the deviation of F
α
(X,t) from orthogonality indicates how non-rigid the motion is local to material
point X and J
α
expresses the local volume gain (J
α > 1) or loss
(J
α < 1). Furthermore, we use ϕ : B0 × [0,T ] → R
3
to denote the
flow map of the mixture. It is related to the Eulerian velocity of the
mixture v as
∂ϕ
∂t
(X,t) = v(ϕ(X,t),t). The deformation gradient of
the mixture and its determinant are denoted as F and J respectively.
Following [Atkin and Craine 1976], the mass and momentum densities of the species are denoted as ρ
α
: B
α
t → R and ρ
α v
α

R respectively. The mass and momentum densities of the mixture
are defined as the respective sums ρ =
Í

and ρv =
Í
α ρ
α v
α
.
With this convention, the velocity of the mixture is defined via
mass average v =
Í
α ρ
α v
α
Í
α ρ
α . This mass averaged notion of velocity
defines the motion of the mixture from the individual species, and
we emphasize that it follows directly from conservation of mass
and momentum considerations. Furthermore, in our formulation we
assume that the mass density of the gas ρ
д
is negligible compared to
that of the water and solid and that the density of water is initially
spatially constant and equal to ρ
w
0
. With these assumptions the
velocity of the mixture follows as v ≈

Lastly, we use Θ : B0 × [0,T ] → R to refer to the material-space
temperature of the solid and θ : Bt × [0,T ] → R as the world-space
temperature. They are related through θ(ϕ(X,t),t) = Θ(X,t).

for a more detailed derivation and motivation of these balances and
the momentum exchanges between them. However, we note the

which states that the rate of change of the momentum of species α
in the region Ω
α

varies based on the rate of change of the Eulerian
momentum as well as the effect of the change of Ω
α

under the
motion of the species, as this will be useful for later derivations.
In contrast to other multi-species MPM approaches, e.g. Yerro et
al. [2015], we consider conservation relative to the motion of the
solid constituent. While the balance laws of the mixture are most
naturally expressed in terms of its own motion, this can complicate
the numerical method since it would typically require explicitly
tracking the mixture motion. Instead, we follow the convention of
Zhao et al. [Zhao and Papadopoulos 2013] to express mass and momentum conservation of the mixture relative to the solid constituent
since it does not require explicit resolution of the mixture flow map.
First, we note that the rate of change of the mass of water in Ω

under the respective constituent motions via Equation (1). We can

We henceforth use q

velocity of the water relative to the solid. Since the set Ω

is arbitrary,
conservation of mass of the water with respect to the motion of the

3.2 Fick’s Law
We assume that the motion of the liquid phase (relative to the solid
phase) q
w is restricted to diffusion in the mixture; Fick’s law [1855]
states that
q
w = −Kθρw ∇s
where K > 0 is a material diffusivity constant, and s =
V
w
V
stands
for the saturation level of the dough, which is in the form of a
volume fraction where V is a local volume of the mixture and V
w is
the local volume of water in the mixture. Intuitively, this means that
water content in the mixture flows from regions of higher saturation
to regions of lower saturation at a rate that depends both on the
material diffusivity K as well as the dough temperature θ.
We note that the density of water ρ
w can be expressed in terms
of the saturation s as

Furthermore, we use q
w · n = β

in Equation (5) where β
w is a material constant that represents the
rate of water mass loss due to exterior conditions.
4 HEAT TRANSFER
Heat flow through the material obeys the first and second law of
thermodynamics, and following [Gonzalez and Stuart 2008] we
summarize our heat energy balance equation as
ρα
Dθ
Dt
= ∇ · (κ∇θ) − θcλ∇ · v, x ∈ Bt
. (9)
Here, α is the specific heat at constant volume which controls the
rate at which temperature changes for a given amount of heating;
and κ is the thermal conductivity which controls the speed with
which heat diffuses through the body. cλ controls rate of temperature decrease resulting from thermal expansion and λ is a Lamé
coefficient. Intuitively, since temperature measures the kinetic energy density at small scales, increases in material volume will tend
to cool the material. We note that this effect was not considered
in previous MPM work on thermal effects. We refer readers to the
