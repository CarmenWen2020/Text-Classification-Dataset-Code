Nonlinear hyperelastic energies play a key role in capturing the fleshy appearance of virtual characters. Real-world, volume-preserving biological
tissues have Poisson’s ratios near 1/2, but numerical simulation within this
regime is notoriously challenging. In order to robustly capture these visual characteristics, we present a novel version of Neo-Hookean elasticity.
Our model maintains the fleshy appearance of the Neo-Hookean model,
exhibits superior volume preservation, and is robust to extreme kinematic
rotations and inversions. We obtain closed-form expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of all of the system’s components, which allows us
to directly project the Hessian to semipositive definiteness, and also leads
to insights into the numerical behavior of the material. These findings also
inform the design of more sophisticated hyperelastic models, which we
explore by applying our analysis to Fung and Arruda-Boyce elasticity. We
provide extensive comparisons against existing material models.

1 INTRODUCTION
The elastic energy used to model deformations determines the visual quality of a simulation, so it must be chosen carefully for virtual characters and virtual humans. The defining quality of biological tissues such as muscle and fat is volume preservation, which is
reflected in their high Poisson’s ratios ν ∈ [0.45, 0.5) (Greaves et al.
2011) and the corresponding visual features that emerge (Figure 2).
However, this near-incompressible regime is notoriously difficult
to simulate robustly and accurately. For instance, the popular corotational model for elasticity (Chao et al. 2010; McAdams et al. 2011;
Müller et al. 2002; Nesme et al. 2009) ostensibly supports materials
within this range, but it linearizes the volume term in a way that
compromises both its volumetric properties and its visual results
(Figure 1, right). Alternatively, force-filtering approaches (Irving
et al. 2004; Teran et al. 2005) inherit the visual quality of the NeoHookean model but introduce additional user parameters.
In this work, we propose a novel Neo-Hookean energy that retains the rich, volumetric character of biological materials and does
not need any filter parameters. While motivated by biological tissues where ν ≈ 0.5, our model behaves well across a wide range
of Poisson’s ratios (ν ∈ [0, 0.5)). Our model exhibits better volume
preservation than equivalent filtered models and does not break
down under the large kinematic rotations that often occur in quasistatic simulations. The computational performance of our method
is competitive with, and often better than, existing methods. We
know of no other model that possesses all of these advantages.
We achieve these properties by performing an analysis that
completely characterizes the Hessian of the energy and results in
closed-form expressions for the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of
each of its terms. The eigendecomposition of the overall system
can then be written as a set of compact expressions, which we

use to isolate the sources of indefiniteness and project them back
to semidefiniteness. As a consequence, we can safely apply our
energy to Newton-type implicit integration schemes that use
conjugate gradient-based linear solvers. While this analysis was
motivated by our Neo-Hookean model, it is sufficiently generic
that it also supports any model formulated in terms of the first
and third invariants of the deformation gradient. As preliminary
examples, we show how it can be extended to Fung (2013) and
Arruda-Boyce (1993) elasticity. We conclude with detailed comparisons to existing hyperelastic energies. In particular, we are
able to phrase the popular corotational model as a linearization of
the Neo-Hookean energy (Section 5.1) and position our model on
a spectrum of successive approximations to this energy.
2 BACKGROUND
Before presenting our material model, we provide a brief review
of existing hyperelastic energies and numerical simulators. In the
following, we represent scalars as unbolded letters (x, J), vectors
as bold lowercase letters (x), and matrices as bold uppercase letters
(X). Greek letters (Ψ, α) represent scalars.
2.1 Deformation Gradient
The fundamental measure of nonlinear deformation is the deformation gradient F. Here, we label its columns with vectors and its
entries with scalars:
F =
⎡
⎢
⎢
⎢
⎢
⎢
⎣
f0 f1 f2
⎤
⎥

⎣

f1 f4 f7
f2 f5 f8
⎤
⎥
⎥

⎥
⎦
. (1)
Table 1 summarizes the derived quantities of F we will use. One
factorization requires special attention: the rotation variant SVD
(Higham 2008; Irving et al. 2004; Twigg and Kačić-Alesić 2010) of
F, which we write as
F = UΣVT and Σ =
⎡
⎢
⎢

⎣
σ0 0 0
0 σ1 0
0 0 σ2
⎤
⎥
⎥
⎥
⎥
⎥
⎦
. (2)
Unlike the standard SVD convention, the rotation variant moves
reflections to Σ, so U and V are rotations with det(U) = det(V) = 1,
and Σ is allowed to have a negative entry.
2.2 Hyperelastic Energies
The elastic behavior of a deformable body can be specified in terms
of a hyperelastic energy density Ψ, such as the corotational (CR)
Table 1. Quantities Derived from the Deformation Gradient F

J = det(F) Relative volume change

ΨCR = μ||F − R||2
F +

tr2 (S − I) . (3)
Here, μ and λ are the Lamé constants, R and S form the polar decomposition of F (Table 1), and I is a 3 × 3 identity matrix. Forces
can be derived from this energy by several means, but a popular
approach uses the first Piola-Kirchhoff (PK1) stress tensor, which
we denote P(F). The PK1 for the corotational material is
PCR(F) = ∂Ψ
∂F = R [μ(S − I) + λ tr(S − I)I] . (4)
After integrating over a volume V and changing variables to vertex displacements u, we obtain a matrix,V P(F) ∂F
∂u , whose columns
are vertex forces. The term ∂F
∂u varies based on the element type,
e.g., tetrahedra or hexahedra, and basis type, e.g., linear or quadratic (Bargteil and Cohen 2014). Other texts describe this derivation (Müller et al. 2008; Sifakis and Barbic 2012), so we will deal
directly with Ψ and P(F) and defer to these references for further
details.
2.3 Robustness Challenges
A key drawback of nonlinear hyperelastic energies is that they
usually contain singularities. Early work on deformable simulation (Hirota et al. 2001) detected these “illegal” states and carefully
avoided them using a backtracking line search. These searches are
challenging to perform robustly, because a NaN in a single degree of freedom can quickly grow to pollute larger regions of the
simulation. This backtracking approach also precludes simulations
where the solution contains inverted elements, which often occurs
in production environments.
Irving et al. (2004) described an explicit method for simulating
nonlinear materials that instead used the rotation variant SVD
(Equation (2)) to write a filtered stress tensor P(Σ) defined in F’s
principal stretch space Σ. For specific values of Σ where P(Σ)
was known to behave badly, the tensor was clamped to constant

or linear functions. Thus, no backtracking was needed to avoid
illegal states. In order to use this method, the user identifies badly
behaved regions of P(Σ) and sets a filtering threshold. Notably,
the usual convention for the rotation variant SVD is to push reflections into the smallest singular value, but subsequent work has
shown that this can introduce subtle problems, including discontinuities and nonoptimal inversion recovery directions (Georgii
and Westermann 2008; Schmedding and Teschner 2008). The work
of Civit-Flores and Susín (2014) provides an excellent overview.
Implicit integration of the force-filtering approach was described by Teran et al. (2005). Since the fourth-order tensor ∂P(F)
∂F
may become indefinite, a separate derivation was needed to guarantee its positive definiteness. The tensor was diagonalized into
one 3 × 3 and three 2 × 2 matrices, and eigenvalues were clamped
to a threshold. This approach has the limitation that Ψ, P(F) and
∂P(F)
∂F can drift out of sync. This issue was alleviated by Stomakhin
et al. (2012) by applying the filter directly to Ψ. Xu et al. (2015) proposed an alternative where users design force curves in principal
stretch space. We instead present an energy that is agnostic to any
reflection convention, even in the presence of inverted elements.
Alternative deformation schemes such as position-based dynamics (Bender et al. 2015; Umetani et al. 2014) and projective dynamics (Bouaziz et al. 2014) have recently emerged. One advantage of these schemes is that the Hessian ∂P(F)
∂F does not need to
be constructed explicitly. However, projective dynamics still need
to specify filtering thresholds and reflection conventions (Narain
et al. 2016; Wang and Yang 2016) to avoid numerical singularities. The advantage that our model requires neither carries over
directly.
3 ENERGY FORMULATION
Following the preceding discussion, we design a new hyperelastic
energy that is stable in four important ways:
• Inversion stability: The energy is singularity-free and does
not need any filters or thresholds.
• Reflection stability: The energy is well behaved regardless
of the reflection convention used in the SVD.
• Rest stability: Under zero load, an element’s rest shape is
preserved.
• Meta-stability under degeneracy: Under point, line, and
plane degeneracies, the forces are defined up to rotation.
We start by examining existing hyperelastic energies that go by
the name “Neo-Hookean.”
3.1 Existing Neo-Hookean Energies
The most common version of Neo-Hookean elasticity is (see,
e.g., Bonet and Wood (2008))
ΨNeo = μ
2
(IC − 3) − μ log J +
λ
2
(log J)
2. (5)
Here, IC and J are defined in Table 1. However, many other versions appear in the literature:
ΨA = μ
2
(IC − 3) − μ log J +
λ
2
(J − 1)
2 [Ogden 1997],
ΨB = μ
2
(J−2/3
IC − 3) +
λ
2
(J − 1)
2 [Bower 2009],
ΨC = μ
2
(J−2/3
IC − 3) +
λ
2
(J − 1) [Wang and Yang 2016].
We examine these energies under the Valanis-Landel hypothesis
(Xu et al. 2015), which posits that many hyperelastic energies can
be separated into length (1D), area (2D), and volume (3D) components. The above models contain length and volume terms, but no
area terms. Adding an area term yields a Mooney-Rivlin model.
1D Length Term: Mooney (1940) originally proposed the
energy
ΨM = μ
2
(IC − 3), (6)
which was later dubbed the “Neo-Hookean” energy by Rivlin
(1948). When unconstrained, this energy achieves its minimum
when the element has collapsed to zero volume, i.e., when IC = 0
and ΨM = −3. Mooney additionally imposed the hard constraint
that J = 1, so the energy is instead minimized at the volumepreserving configuration that is the closest to the stretch space
origin. Even without this constraint, we note that ΨM is well behaved under inversion. The energy relative to a zero-volume configuration is always well defined irrespective of an element’s current
state.
In contrast, the ΨB and ΨC energies use a modified Neo-Hookean
term μ/2(J−2/3
IC − 3) (Rivlin 1948). The J−2/3 term factors off the
nearest squared isotropic stretch from IC, leaving only the squared
distortional part of the deformation. It also introduces numerical
problems by growing without bound under compression, i.e., as
J → 0, and becoming undefined at J = 0. Therefore, we prefer to
use a ΨM length term in lieu of a modified energy.
3D Volume Term: The remaining terms in the above energies are volume-preserving penalty terms. The volume terms from
ΨNeo clearly present numerical difficulties:
ΨNeo,volume = −μ log J +
λ
2
(log J)
2. (7)
In addition to growing unbounded as J → 0, they become infeasible for J < 0. These difficulties motivated the design of the forcefiltering approach (Irving et al. 2004). Any energy with a logarithm,
including ΨA,volume = −μ log J + λ/2(J − 1)
2, will also have these
problems.
In contrast, ΨB,volume = λ/2(J − 1)
2 does not have these issues
and is bounded, well defined, and invertible. Such terms have been
used (Martin et al. 2011; Teschner et al. 2004) to sidestep the need
for any inversion handling. A promising candidate is then
ΨD = μ
2
(IC − 3) +
λ
2
(J − 1)
2, (8)
but it has a key drawback that we must address.
3.2 Rest Stabilization
While ΨD possesses inversion stability, it lacks what we will call
rest stability. In the solid mechanics literature (e.g., Bonet and
Wood (2008), Section 6.4.3), it is often mentioned that the hyperelastic energy should vanish at identity. This occurs with ΨD, but it
is more important that the PK1 resolve to zero, as this is the true
indicator that the energy has been extremized. Otherwise, forces
appear when the body is at rest and overwrite the intended rest
state with a different, parameter-dependent state. This is a known

side effect of certain barrier functions (Schüller et al. 2013). One solution is to increase the volume penalty constant λ dramatically in
order to reduce the visual appearance of the artifact (e.g., Blemker
et al. (2005) suggests ∼1,000μ). We avoid this approach, because it
precludes the artifact-free simulation of materials with lower Poisson’s ratios. Scaling λ also increases the indefiniteness of the Hessian (see Section 4.6) and should be done judiciously.
Intuitively, the problem is that the effective rest state no
longer coincides with J = 1. Instead, it coincides with a smaller
J that causes an element to slightly deflate. Consequently, we ask
whether we can inflate each element so that, when it deflates, it
settles to rest at J = 1. To answer this question, we consider the
PK1 of ΨD:
PD(F) = μF + λ ∂J
∂F (J − 1). (9)
An energy is rest stable if PD(I) = 0 but PD(I) is nonzero:
PD(I) = μI + λ ∂ det(I)
∂F (det(I) − 1) = μI. (10)
To recover rest stability, we modify (J − 1)
2 to shift the root from
1 to α; i.e., we inflate the element to a volume greater than one:

Since constants disappear under differentiation, this material
model is functionally equivalent to
ΨE = μ

(J − 1)
2. (13)
This is strikingly similar to the original ΨNeo from Equation (5),
except the log J terms have been replaced with (J −1). We make
two important observations. First, ΨNeo is rest stable, but not
singularity-free. Second, (J −1) is the first term in the Taylor series of log J at J =1. Essentially, we have performed a singularityremoving Taylor truncation of ΨNeo about a volume-preserving
state, resulting in an inversion and rest-stable material model. We
can also verify that our energy ΨE is reflection stable. The IC term
involves the squared singular values of F, so any negation convention is irrelevant. Since the J term is the product of the singular
values, the sign convention is again irrelevant. Similar reasoning
can be used for PK1, and we show in Section 4.5.1 that the Hessian
is agnostic to the convention as well.
3.3 Meta-Stability under Degeneracy
The energy now has inversion, reflection, and rest stability. However, its behavior must be examined under degeneracy, i.e., when
an element has been crushed to a plane, line, or point. This examination can also be viewed as a Drucker stability analysis (Bower
2009).
Fig. 3. To stress-test our stable Neo-Hookean (ν = 0.49) model, we randomly scramble a cube’s vertices within a space of twice its volume. The
cube recovers its rest pose, highlighting our model’s robustness under extreme, inverted configurations.
An extensive treatment of all three degeneracies is given in the
supplemental materials, but we will sketch the main results here.
For the case where an element is crushed to a plane, the energy
is stable. Material forces appear along the normal direction to the
plane and work to restore the original shape.
When the element is crushed to a line, the energy is meta-stable.
The forces resolve to zero, but the Hessian is negative definite.
For a material that is invertible, this meta-stable state is correct.
If an unconstrained element has been crushed to exactly a line,
the shape it should return to is underdetermined, because the configuration is equidistant from all possible rotations of the original
shape about the line. However, negative definiteness guarantees
that any perturbation (e.g., momentum) will select a rotation, and
the element will self-restore. The alternative to meta-stability is a
singularity at this configuration, which is clearly undesirable.
When an element is crushed to a point, i.e., F = 0, the forces
disappear and the Hessian is positive definite, which means the
configuration will remain stable even in the presence of perturbations. This behavior is undesirable, though the basin of attraction
is vanishingly small for Poisson’s ratios that correspond to biological tissue (ν ≥ 0.45). For completeness, we introduce one more
term to eliminate the basin across a wide range of ν.
We add a regularized origin barrier log (IC + δ ) that inserts a
peak of negative definiteness about F = 0 but uses δ to smooth
away the logarithmic singularity. In the supplemental material, we
show that δ = 1 is the value that exactly produces semidefiniteness
at F = 0. Our final energy is then
Ψnew = μ
2
(IC − 3) +
λ
2
(J − α)
2 − μ
2 log (IC + 1). (14)
As we derive in the supplemental material, the rest-stability term
now shifts to α = 1 + μ/λ − (μ/4) λ.
3.4 Lamé Reparameterization
With this energy, we now consider the reparameterization of the
material parameters μ and λ in order to maintain consistency with
Hooke’s law. To this end, we shift the values of μ and λ so that our
model reproduces the PK1 of linear elasticity, which is of the form
P(F) = 2μLaméϵ + λLamé tr (ϵ )I, (15)
where ϵ =1/2(F + FT ) − I is the linearized strain tensor, and the coefficients μLamé and λLamé are the Lamé parameters in linear elasticity. The linearization of the stress derived from Equation (14)
