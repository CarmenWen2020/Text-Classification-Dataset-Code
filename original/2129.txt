We present a multi-species model for the simulation of gravity driven landslides and debris flows with porous sand and water interactions. We use
continuum mixture theory to describe individual phases where each species
individually obeys conservation of mass and momentum and they are coupled through a momentum exchange term. Water is modeled as a weakly
compressible fluid and sand is modeled with an elastoplastic law whose
cohesion varies with water saturation. We use a two-grid Material Point
Method to discretize the governing equations. The momentum exchange
term in the mixture theory is relatively stiff and we use semi-implicit time
stepping to avoid associated small time steps. Our semi-implicit treatment is
explicit in plasticity and preserves symmetry of force linearizations. We develop a novel regularization of the elastic part of the sand constitutive model
that better mimics plasticity during the implicit solve to prevent numerical
cohesion artifacts that would otherwise have occurred. Lastly, we develop
an improved return mapping for sand plasticity that prevents volume gain
artifacts in the traditional Drucker-Prager model.

1 INTRODUCTION
While wet sand is both ubiquitous and literally child’s play, simulating the underlying interaction of water and sand certainly is not. In
fact, this type of visual effect is rarely seen in feature movie productions, typically because it is considered too complex and difficult
to achieve with existing particle-based simulation techniques. This
is surprising given that water simulations, and to a lesser extent
also sand simulations, are routinely undertaken in VFX. It is the
complex nature of the changing material behaviors resulting from

coefficient and lower cohesion will fail more easily.
the mixing of sand and water that complicates simulation. However,
we argue that this is precisely what makes the animation of wet
sand so visually intriguing and hence desirable to master.
Most practitioners in the VFX industry would agree that animation of water is a mature area of research, as evident by its abundance
and the fact that several excellent commercial solutions exist today,
c.f. Houdini, Maya, and RealFlow just to mention a few. Conversely,
animation of sand is considered challenging by most, and is still a
subject of significant research. Although the Material Point Method
(MPM) [Sulsky et al. 1995] has been demonstrated to produce encouraging results for sand simulations, commercial solutions tend
to use simpler particle based techniques, like Position Based Dynamics (PBD), which is easier to implement, but less well founded
in continuum theory. However, mixtures of water and sand present
a completely new set of simulation challenges for which, to the
best of our knowledge, there is still no established best practice in
VFX, let alone off-the-shelf commercial solutions. While there are
many successful examples of wet sand animation, they tend to be
based on art-directed constrained simulations or even procedural
particle systems. Given the success of simulating sand with MPM it
is natural to explore a similar approach for wet sand. Such a unified
MPM description of the mixing of water and sand is exactly what
motivated our work.
In this paper, we develop a method for multi-species MPM to allow
interactions between sand and water for gravity driven landslides
and debris flows. We resolve wet sand transitions from cohesive
rigid grains to flowing slurries as water saturation increases. We use
a semi-implicit time stepping scheme to deal with stiff terms in the
multi-species momentum exchange. The semi-implicit approach in
[Stomakhin et al. 2013] produces artificial cohesive effects for sand
simulations. We introduce a unilateral modification to the elastic
energy function that better mimics the effect of plasticity to prevent these cohesive artifacts. Furthermore, we develop an improved
return mapping for Drucker-Prager plasticity that reduces the volume gain observed with lower grid resolutions. In our multi-species
treatment, we use the two grid scheme proposed by Bandara and
Soga [2015]. Each material point is associated with a set of grid
nodes and the interaction between the two species is via an interaction term proportionate to relative velocity between the phases.
This term is stiff for practical porosities, and it is impractical to do
explicit simulation since it would require a time-step restriction
on the order of ∆t ≈ 10−6 − 10−5
. Our semi-implicit treatment allows us to use a time step on the order of ∆t = 10−3
. Furthermore,
using our modification to the elastic energy function and lagged
plasticity approach, the system to be solved remains symmetric. We
summarize our contributions as:
• A unilateral elastic constitutive model modification framework that removes numerical cohesion with semi-implicit
time stepping and plasticity.
• An improved return mapping algorithm for Drucker-Prager
plasticity with reduced volume gain artifacts.
• A semi-implicit two grid MPM discretization of stiff interaction terms in multi-species continuum equations.
• A model for wet sand cohesion based on water saturation.
2 PREVIOUS WORK
Probably the earliest work on water and sand in computer graphics
is by Peachey [1986]. Rungjiratananon et al. simulate sand-water
interaction in real-time using a hybrid Smoothed Particles Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Discrete-Element Method (DEM) approach
[Rungjiratananon et al. 2008]. Lenaerts and Dutre [2009] also couple
water with porous granular materials using SPH. Notably, these
approaches capture a wider range of porous phenomena than that
considered in our approach. While we focus on gravity driven landslides and debris flows, their approaches more accurately capture
surface tension driven effects like capillary action drawing water
into dry sand. They can also handle landslides and debris flows, but
they do so with SPH, whereas we develop an MPM approach that
naturally allows for implicit time stepping and high resolution simulation. Other graphics approaches have shown the efficacy of hybrid
Lagrangian/Eulerian approaches like FLIP and MPM, including sand

Our approach is the first MPM technique in graphics that considers multi-species modeling for porous sand/water. However, mixture
theory and multi-species simulations have been used for a wide
range of effects in computer graphics. Nielsen and Osterby [2013]
simulate spray and mist with a two-continua mixture model. Takashi
et al. [2003] use the Cubic Interpolation Propagation method to couple spray, water and foam continua. Losasso et al. [2008] and Yang et
al. [2014] also represent spray and dense water with multiple phases.
Similar multi-species interaction ideas have been used for bubbles
in incompressible flow [Mihalef et al. 2009; Ren et al. 2015; Song
et al. 2005; Thürey et al. 2007]. Liu et al. [2008] use two continua to
simulate mixtures of air and dust. Multi-species approaches have
been used for miscible and immiscible fluids [Bao et al. 2010; He
et al. 2015; Kang et al. 2010; Ren et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2015].
Various researchers in engineering have shown the efficacy of simulating water and soil interactions with the MPM. Abe et al. [2014]
solve coupled hydromechanical problems of fluid-saturated soil subjected to large deformation with a two grid MPM algorithm based on
Biot’s mixture theory. Bandara et al. use a single grid MPM method
for saturated and unsaturated soils that undergo large deformations
in [Bandara et al. 2016] and two grid MPM to represent soil skeleton
and pore water layers in [Bandara and Soga 2015]. Jassim et al. [2013]
also develop a two grid MPM approach for soil mechanics problems.
Mast et al. [Mast et al. 2014] use MPM to simulate large deformation,
gravity-driven landslides of porous soil. Mackenzie-Helnwein et
al. [2010] examine the multi-species momentum exchange terms for
problems with liquefaction, landslides, and sedimentation with two
grid MPM.
3 MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND
We model sand and water as a multi-species continuum using mixture theory [Atkin and Craine 1976; Borja 2006]. With this approach,
each species is given distinct material properties, and their motion is
derived from distinct velocity fields. This kinematic assumption allows sand and water to occupy the same points in space at the same
time to create the mixture. We use superscript s to represent sand
quantities and superscriptw to represent water quantities. With this
convention, the primary state is defined in terms of mass density
ρ
α
(x,t) and material velocity v
α
(x,t), where α = s,w. The momentum density of phase α is given by ρ
α v
α
. The total mass density of
the mixture is the sum ρ = ρ
s + ρ
w and total momentum is the sum
ρv = ρ

w . This defines the velocity v =

of the mixture as the mass-averaged velocity of the constituents.

p

P

α = 0 must be zero to not affect the total linear momentum of
the mixture. Indeed with this constraint we can show by summing
over α in Equation 3

where we have summed over α and introduced σ =

, which
denotes the Cauchy stress in the mixture expressed as the sum of
the partial stresses in each species. In other words, with this notion
of the Cauchy stress, conservation of linear momentum for the
individual species implies conservation of linear momentum for the
mixture.
3.1 Sand elastoplasticity
We define the constitutive behavior of sand with elastoplasticity as
in Klár et al. [2016]. However, their approach was for dry sand. Wet
sand is capable of retaining its shape via tensile stresses and the
unmodified Drucker-Prager yield condition does not admit this. We
modify the model slightly to include cohesive stresses. The amount
of cohesion varies with the saturation level of water in the mixture.
We assume that the sand partial stress σ
s
is defined in terms of the
hyperelastic potential energy density ψ
s
as
σ
s =
1
det(F
s
)
∂ψ
s
∂F
(F
s,E
)F
s,E ⊤
. (5)
Here, F
s
is the deformation gradient of the sand motion, which
evolves as D
s
Dt F
s = ∇v
s F
s
. The appearance of the 1
det(F
s
)
and F
s,E ⊤
terms arise because we write the potential energy density in terms of
the deformation gradient. With this convention, its derivative gives
rise to the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress and these terms are needed
to transform it into the Cauchy stress. As typically done in finite
strain elastoplasticity [Bonet and Wood 2008], it is decomposed into
F
s = F
s,E F
s,P
to define a plastic flow. For sand, F
s,E
represents
the remembered compression and shearing, while F
s,P
represents
the forgotten sliding and separation. We use the Drucker-Prager
[Drucker and Prager 1952] plastic flow and yield condition to determine the evolution of the elastic (F
s,E
) and plastic (F
s,P
) parts
of the deformation gradient. The Drucker-Prager yield condition
is defined from the constraint that the shear stress should be no
larger than the compressive normal stress in all directions. This
expresses a mechanical interaction that is consistent with Coulomb
friction. While dry sand is modeled effectively with this assumption,
it precludes the effects of cohesion. However, cohesive effects can
be modeled by modifying the elastic stress yield condition to be
cF tr(σ
s
) + ∥σ
s −
tr(σ
s
)
d
I∥F ≤ cC, (6)
where d = 2, 3 is the spatial dimension, cC ≥ 0 increases with
the amount of cohesion in the material and cF ≥ 0 increases with
amount of friction between grains. E.g. for dry sand in Klár et
al. [2016] they used cC = 0. A positive cC shifts the yield surface
along the hydrostatic axis (the line where tr(σ
s
) = 0), which allows
the material to exhibit stress under tension and thus cohere to itself.
Here we model cohesivity as a function of water saturation in the
sand. This is naturally measured in terms of the volume fraction of
water in the mixture ϕ
w =
ρ
w
ρ
so that cC = cC (ϕ
w ).
Inequality 6 is referred to as the plastic yield condition, if it is
satisfied, there will be no further plastic deformation. The boundary
of the region in stress space defined by cF tr(σ
s
)+∥σ
s −
tr(σ
s
)
d
I∥F =
cC (ϕ
w ) is called the yield surface. For states of stress on the yield
surface, plastic flow will commence when a perfectly elastic assumption would drive the stress out of the region. The plasticity functions
as a means of satisfying this inequality constraint.

of the constitutive behavior for the sand phase. This is largely

tr(ϵ ) where F
s = UΣV is the singular decomposition of F

and ϵ = log(Σ). However, we provide
some novel modifications that allow for more efficient implicit time
integration. We note that with the plastic yield condition from Inequality 6, much of the energy landscape has no effect since it
produces stresses outside of the yield surface. To mitigate this we
modify the energy density such that it smoothly transitions to zero
in these regions. This has no effect on the continuous behavior of
the governing equations, but it improves the performance of our
semi-implicit time stepping. Essentially, our modification modifies
the elastic behavior outside the yield surface to better resemble the
effects of plasticity.
Our approach is similar to, and indeed inspired by the unilateral approaches in [Alduán and Otaduy 2011; Daviet and BertailsDescoubes 2016; Ihmsen et al. 2013; Narain et al. 2010]. We thus refer
to our modified energy as the unilateral energy function ψ˜s,U (ϵ ).
We define this as the product of the original energy function ψ˜s
(ϵ )
and a multiplier h(ϵ )
ψ˜s,U (ϵ ) = ψ˜s
(ϵ )h(ϵ ). (7)
The multiplier makes sure that the energy density function to transition to zero in regions outside of the yield surface (as smoothly as
possible). We define it to be symmetric about the hydrostatic axis in
the strain space (axis of equal strain, see Figure 5) since the original
energy ψ˜s has this property and we wish to preserve it in ψ˜s,U . To
construct it, we partition strain space into the three regions labeled
A, B, and C in Figure 5. In region A, the value of the multiplier is
simply one and the modified constitutive model is identical to the
original one. Conversely, in region C, the multiplier is set to zero. In
region B, the multiplier transitions from one to zero in a C
2 manner.
The boundary of region A and B defines two envelopes that are
symmetric about the hydrostatic axis. To best preserve the behavior
of sand, we want region A to cover most of the region inside of the
Drucker-Prager cone, illustrated as the green cone in Figure 5.
Fig. 6. Unilateral extension. We demonstrate a 2D sand column collapse
with different values of c0 coefficient in the unilateral modified energy
density function. From top to bottom, c0 = 1.1, 2, 2.5, 3. The left image is
of an early frame and the right is of a later frame. Here parameters a and b
from Equation 10 are a = −0.5, and b = 0. As c0 increases, the envelopes in
the unilateral extension become increasingly poor approximations of the
Drucker-Prager cone and we see volume loss artifacts.
The construction of this multiplier function is done as a composition of two functions: hs which is a scalar function and f which
is a function of the strain ϵ. If we let o denote the hydrostatic axis
(o =
1√
2
(1, 1)
⊤ in 2D or 1√
3
(1, 1, 1)
⊤ in 3D), then we can compute
u = ϵ · o to be the component of the strain in the hydrostatic axis
and v = ∥ϵ − uo∥. The function f is defined as
f (ϵ ) = co
v
4
1 + |v|
3
. (8)
The coefficientco controls the opening of the envelope of regions
A and B around the hydrostatic axis. The scalar function hs is chosen
so that the multiplier function is twice continuously differentiable,
and is given by
hs (z) =




1 if z < 0
0 if z > 1
1 − 10z

(9)
The multiplier function is then defined for some choice of parameters a,b, and sC.

The parameter a and b determines the intersection of the hydrostatic axis with the boundary of region A and B respectively. The
parameter sC controls a shift of this multiplier region along the
hydrostatic axis.

3.3 Momentum exchange
The momentum exchange terms p
s
, p
w for water and porous sand
interactions can generally be viewed as a combination of dissipative
and reversible interactions [Borja 2006]. We follow the formulation
of Bandara and Soga [2016] because, like them, we are concerned primarily with gravity driven flows such as fast catastrophic landslides
and debris flows. Their formulation assumes

and n is the sand porosity, ˆk is the sand permeability and д is the gravitational acceleration, ϕ
w =

w
ρ
is the water
volume fraction and p
w is the water pressure. The first term represents viscous forces generated by sand particles moving through
the fluid. Although it can be conceived from the view of an idealized particle moving through a Stokes fluid, it simply amounts to a
Coulomb-friction-like response [Mackenzie-Helnwein et al. 2010].
The second term is often called the “buoyancy term" in mixture
theories [Robert and Soga 2013]. It can be conceived from entropy
equilibrium constraints or from the physical consideration that the
pore fluid pressure multiplying the porosity is appropriate notion
of reversible pressure, however there is some debate about its appropriateness outside of immiscible mixtures [Drumheller 2000].
Mackenzie-Helnwein et al. [2010] omit the second term and view
the momentum exchange terms as purely dissipative processes. We
also follow this approach for the majority of the examples presented
in the paper, however we include one example demonstrating its
effect in Figure 4. Even with the inclusion of the active term from
[Bandara et al. 2016], we are only capable of simulating a rather
narrow range of porous media phenomena. While this is sufficient
for landslides and debris flows, phenomena such as capillary action
drawing water into dry sand is not achievable in our approach.
3.4 Cohesion and Saturation
As in Robert and Soga in [2013], we assume that the sand cohesion
varies as a function of water saturation. We measure saturation as
the percentage of water in the mixture which we estimate as the ratio
of the density of the water phase to the total density ϕ
w =
ρ
w
ρw +ρ
s .
The cohesion of sand is zero when it is completely dry (ϕ
w = 0).
Intuitively, as dry sand becomes saturated with more water, the
cohesivity of the wet sand should increase as wet sand tends to better
hold its shape. Indeed this was observed in the work of Robert and

Soga in [2013]. However, they also observe that this increase only
continues to a maximal value c
max
C
when the saturation is around
ϕ
w = 0.4. Beyond this point the sand becomes more compliant
to flowing and less cohesively elastic. In all of our multispecies
examples, we model water interaction with wet sand that is capable
of holding its shape. We thus set the sand cohesion to be initially
maximal, even in the absence of the water phase. Based on the
observations in Robert and Soga [2013], we then assume that the
cohesion decreases linearly with increasing saturation beyond this
point (with cohesion equal to zero at full saturation ϕ
w = 1).
4 DISCRETIZATION
First, we explain the notation used in the discretization section.
There are two sets of grids: one is associated with sand material
and the other is associated with water. As with the continuous
equations, the superscript α = s,w indicates the corresponding
species. Whenever a symbol has a subscript i or j, this denotes one
degree of freedom in grid node index i or j. Subscript p is used to
denote attributes that belong to a particle. A symbol that is not
followed by a subscript refers to the whole collection of grid nodes
as degrees of freedom. For example v
s,n+1
refers to all of the sand
grid nodes that are active at step n + 1.
We discretize the continuum equation using the Material Point
Method (MPM). As in other approaches in the engineering literature
[Bandara and Soga 2015; Jassim et al. 2013; Mackenzie-Helnwein
et al. 2010], we use two sets of grids (Figure 7): one for the solid
particles and the other for the water particles. This is the primary
difference between our approach and others recently used in the
graphics literature. The overview of the algorithm is as follows:

each species to its corresponding grid (§4.1).
