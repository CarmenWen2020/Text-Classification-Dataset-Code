This article addresses the adaptive event-triggered neural control problem for nonaffine pure-feedback nonlinear multiagent systems with dynamic disturbance, unmodeled dynamics, and dead-zone input. Radial basis function neural networks are applied to approximate the unknown nonlinear function. A dynamic signal is constructed to deal with the design difficulties in the unmodeled dynamics. Moreover, to reduce the communication burden, we propose an event-triggered strategy with a varying threshold. Based on the Lyapunov function method and adaptive neural control approach, a novel event-triggered control protocol is constructed, which realizes that the outputs of all followers converge to a neighborhood of the leader's output and ensures that all signals are bounded in the closed-loop system. An illustrative simulation example is applied to verify the usefulness of the proposed algorithms.
SECTION I.Introduction
In recent years, the consensus problem for multiagent systems has attracted great interests due to its broad applications in many areas, such as unmanned air vehicle formations [1], triggering networks [2], and cooperative surveillance [3]. Since various disturbances, uncertainties, and nonlinearities are unavoidable in practical systems, the researchers proposed some effective control protocols. In [4], under a fixed topology, the robust consensus tracking was solved for multiagent systems subject to communication disturbances. The distributed output regulation problem for a class of nonlinear multiagent systems subject to uncertain leaders was addressed in [5]. Based on the multiagent consensus algorithm, Sun et al. [6] constructed a novel distributed coordinated control protocol to improve the energy utilization between the energy Internet and the main grid. Distributed consensus control problem for nonlinear time-delay multiagent systems was investigated in [7] by using neural networks (NNs). Based on neighbor state estimators, Hong et al. [8] studied the distributed consensus tracking control problem for the multiagent subject to an active leader. A creative adaptive fixed-time control was designed in [9] for error-constrained pure-feedback interconnected nonlinear systems. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are few study results for pure-feedback nonlinear multiagent systems with nonaffine forms. Therefore, the research of nonaffine pure-feedback nonlinear multiagent systems is challenging and meaningful.

Distributed control of the multiagent systems is currently facilitated by recent technological advances in computing and communication resources. However, this may increase the communication burden in the system, which may not be feasible in many practical applications. It is, thus, desirable to design novel control schemes. Motivated by this fact, these researchers developed event-triggered control protocol for multiagent systems [10]–[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20]. An adaptive distributed event-triggered control protocol was developed in [10] to realize average consensus of first-order multiagent systems subject to undirected graph. In [14], a novel distributed event-triggered control law and a novel distributed event-triggered mechanism were proposed to solve cooperative global robust practical output regulation problem for second-order multiagent systems. Under directed graph, Guo et al. [16] designed a novel distributed event-triggered sampled-data transmission protocol for multiagent systems. In [17], the event-triggered control strategy of multiagent systems subject to combinational measurements was investigated. An event-triggered control protocol was developed in [19] to address the cooperative output regulation problem for multiagent systems. Liu and Huang [20] solved the event-triggered cooperative global robust output regulation problem for high-order multiagent systems via a distributed internal model design.

At the same time, the nonlinear systems subject to the unmodeled dynamics and dynamic disturbances that are caused by measurement noise, modeling errors, modeling simplifications external disturbances, and so on have been widely studied in practical engineering. The existence of them usually lowers the control performances of systems and even leads to instability of the systems. To solve these problems, some effective control methods have been developed [21]–[22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29]. Cheah et al. [21] developed an adaptive Jacobian control method for the robot trajectory tracking subject to dynamic uncertainties, which applied the visual task-space information [23] to avoid acceleration measurements. In [25], an adaptive decentralized backstepping output-feedback control strategy was developed for nonlinear large-scale systems subject to dynamics uncertainties. To handle the unmodeled dynamics in stochastic systems, Tong et al. [27] developed a robust adaptive output-feedback control method by using a small-gain theorem. A robust adaptive control approach was designed in [28] for nonlinear systems subject to unmodeled dynamics.

Motivated by the aforementioned observations, this article mainly studies adaptive neural event-triggered control protocol for nonaffine pure-feedback nonlinear multiagent systems subject to unmodeled dynamics and unknown dead zone. The main contributions of this article can be summarized as follows.

Different from the literature [30], we develop a novel event-triggered adaptive neural control protocol by combining the hyperbolic tangent function and adaptive backstepping technology for multiagent systems to reduce the communication burden and solve the adaptive neural cooperative control problem of the nonlinear nonaffine multiagent system subject to unmodeled dynamics.

The event-triggered technology is integrated into the backstepping design procedure of nonaffine pure-feedback nonlinear multiagent systems subject to unmodeled dynamics for the first time, which lowers the burden of communication while maintains the stability of the system.

Both unknown dead-zone and unmodeled dynamics are considered simultaneously, and all follower agents are modeled by nonlinear dynamics in nonaffine pure-feedback form, which makes the systems more reasonable in practice.

The rest of this article is constituted as follows. In Section II, the basic graph theory and the problem statement are given. The radial basis function (RBF) NNs are introduced in Section III. Section IV presents the main results of this article, which includes the design of real and virtual controllers. Numerical simulation is provided in Section V. Finally, the conclusion is given in Section VI.

SECTION II.Preliminaries
A. Graph Theory
Let G=(W,ϝ,A) be a weight dagraph, which is applied to describe the communication topology of multiagent systems. The node set of agents is represented as W={v1,v2,…,vk} with vi being the i th agent. ϝ⊆W×W represents the edge set, and A=[ai,j] is the adjacency matrix. Let ϵj,i=(vj,vi) be a directed edge; when ϵj,i=(vj,vi)∈ϝ, the agent i can receive information from agent j , and the ai,j represents the quality of the communication from agent j to agent i , i.e., ϵj,i∈ϝ ⟺ai,j>0; otherwise, ai,j=0 and ai,i=0 . The neighbor set of agent i is represented by Ni={j|vj,vi∈ϝ} . Define the Laplacian matrix of G as L=diag(∑kj=1|a1j|,…,∑kj=1|akj|)−A . A directed graph has a directed spanning tree if there exists at least one node having a directed path to all other nodes.

In this article, consider a leader node v0 and N follower nodes vi . Let B= diag(|b1|,…,|bk|)∈Rk×k be the leader adjacency matrix associated with G¯ . Here, bi is the weight of the edge from v0 to vi . For G¯ , denote the augmented graph as G¯={W¯,ϝ¯,A} , which includes the node set W¯={v0,v1,…,vk} and the edge set ϝ¯∈W¯×W¯ . If leader node is considered as a root node, then G¯ includes a directed spanning tree.

B. Problem Statement
Consider a class of nonlinear nonaffine pure-feedback multiagent systems described by
p˙i=z˙i,k=z˙i,ni=yi=q(pi,zi)fi,k(z¯i,k,zi,k+1)+Δi,k(zi,pi,t)fi,ni(z¯i,ni,Γi(ui))+Δi,ni(zi,pi,t)zi,1(1)

Δi,k denotes a nonlinear dynamic disturbance. The p -dynamics in (1) represents the unmodeled dynamics, and fi,k(⋅):Rk×R→R denotes the unknown smooth nonaffine function (i=1,2,…,N,k=1,…,ni) . q(⋅) and Δi,k(⋅) are assumed to be uncertain Lipschitz continuous functions. ui denotes the system input subject to dead zone, and Γi(ui) is the dead-zone output.

The dynamic of the leader agent is modeled by
z˙d=yd=fd(zd,t)zd(2)
View Sourcewhere fd(zd,t) is continuous in t and satisfies the local Lipschitz condition in zd for t≥0 , and yd∈R is the output of the leader.

To reduce the burden of communication in the network control system, we design an event-triggered mechanism, which is described as
ui=tk+1=ϖi(tk) ∀t∈[tk,tk+1)inf{t>tk||ξi(t)|>β|ui(t)|+r}(3)(4)
View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.with ξi(t)=ϖi(t)−ui(t) being the error between the intermediate control ϖi(t) and the control input ui(t). 0<β<1 and r are the design parameters.

According to [31], we have ϖi(t)=(1+φ1(t)β)ui(t)+φ2(t)r in the interval [tk,tk+1 ) with |φm(t)|≤1(m=1,2) being time-varying parameters. Furthermore, one has
ui(t)=ϖi(t)1+φ1(t)β−φ2(t)r1+φ1(t)β.(5)

Remark 1:
For the abovementioned event-triggered mechanism, similar to [32], the larger the designed parameters β and r , the lower the trigger frequency, and the smaller the β and r , the higher the trigger frequency. β is an arbitrary constant that satisfies 0<β<1 . φ1(t) and φ2(t) can be any constant satisfying |φm(t)|≤1(m=1,2).

According to [33], the dead-zone model is designed as follows:
Γi(ui)=⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪mi,l(ui−ρi,l),0,mi,r(ui+ρi,r),ui≥ρi,l−ρi,r<ui<ρi,lui≤−ρi,r(6)
View Sourcewhere mi,l and mi,r denote the right and the left slope of the dead zone, respectively, and the parameters ρi,l and −ρi,r are the breakpoints of input nonlinearity.

To facilitate the controller design, we give the following assumptions for the dead zone.

Assumption 1:
The dead-zone slopes are the same under negative and positive situation, i.e., mi,l=mi,r=m .

Assumption 2:
The dead-zone parameters ρi,l, ρi,r , and m are unknown bounded, i.e., there exist known constants ρl1 , ρl2 , ρr1 , ρr2 , m1 , and m2 such that ρl1≤ρi,l≤ρl2 , ρr1≤ρi,r≤ρr2 , and m1≤m≤m2 .

The actuator dead zone can be rewritten as
Γi(ui)=mui(t)+wi(t)(7)
View Sourcewhere
wi(t)=⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪−mρi,l,−mui(t),mρi,r,ui≥ρi,l−ρi,r<ui<ρi,lui≤−ρi,r
View Sourcewith wi(t) being a bounded function; there exists a constant wM>0 , and one has wi(t)≤wM .

Definition 1:
[34] The tracking errors of the system (1) under directed graph are said to be cooperatively semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (CSUUB) if there are constants ϰ1>0 and ϰ2>0 and the bounds c1>0 and c2>0 independent of t0 , and for every ϱ1∈(0,ϰ1) and ϱ2∈(0,ϰ2) , there is T≥0 independent of t0 , such that |yi(t0)−yd(t0)|≤ϱ1 implies |yi(t)−yd(t)|≤c1 , and |yj(t0)−yi(t0)|≤ϱ2 means that |yj(t)−yi(t)|≤c2 for t≥t0+T(j≠i,i,j=1,…,N) .

According to the mean-value theorem, similar to [35], the function fi,k(z¯i,k,zi,k+1) in (1) can be expressed as
fi,k(z¯i,k,zi,k+1)=fi,ni(z¯i,ni,Γi(ui))=fi,k(z¯i,k,z0i,k+q1)+gi,k(zi,k+1−z0i,k+q1)fi,ni(z¯i,ni,Γ0i(ui))+gi,ni(Γi(ui)−Γ0i(ui))(8)
View Sourcewhere z0i,k+q1 is some point between zero and zi,k+1 , and Γ0i(ui) is some point between zero and Γi(ui).∂fi,k(z¯i,k,zi,k+1)/∂zi,k+1=gi,k(z¯i,k,zi,k+1),k=1,…,ni , and zi,ni+1=ui . Furthermore, by choosing z0i,k+q1=0 and Γ0i(ui)=0 , we have
p˙i=z˙i,k=z˙i,ni=yi=q(pi,zi)fi,k+gi,kzi,k+1+Δi,k(zi,pi,t)fi,ni+gi,niΓi(ui)+Δi,ni(zi,pi,t)zi,1.(9)
View Source

We use Δi,k, gi,k , and fi,k to denote Δi,k(zi,pi,t),gi,k(zi,k+1) , and fi,k(z¯i,k,0) .

Theorem 1:
Consider the nonlinear nonaffine pure-feedback multiagent systems (9) subject to dead-zone and dynamic uncertainties. Under Assumptions 1–6, the adaptive neural control protocol is designed with event-triggered condition, which ensures that all followers’ outputs are able to converge to a small neighborhood of the leader output, and all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded. Furthermore, for any ϵ>0 , the following inequality holds:
limt→∞∥∥y−y–d∥∥≤ϵ.(58)
View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.

Proof:
Choose the following Lyapunov function V as:
V=∑i=1NVi,ni.
View SourceDefine χ¯i=min{2g0ci,l,ϰ~i,c¯}>0,l=1,…,ni and χ0=∑nii=1χi+(d0/ε) . From (57), one has
V˙i,ni≤−χ¯iVi,ni+χ0+(1−2tanh2(ei,1v))z21μ0(z21)ε.(59)
View SourceAccording to (57), the first term −χ¯iVi,ni is negative definite, and the second term χ0>0 is a constant. Nevertheless, the last term, (1−2tanh2(ei,1/v))([z21μ0(z21)]/ε) , may be positive or negative, which depends on the size of ei,1 . To analyze the stability of the closed-loop system from (57), the following two cases should be considered.

Case 1:
For any v>0,ei,1∈Ωei,1={ei,1||ei,1|<0.8814v} is defined in (26). According to coordinate transformation (17), Assumption 4, and synchronization error ei,1 , we know that zi,1 is bounded. Because μ0(z21) is a nonnegative smooth function, (1−2tanh2(ei,1/v))([z21μ0(z21)]/ε) is also bounded, and c0 is assumed to be its bound. From (57), one has
V˙≤−χ¯V+χ(60)
View Sourcewhere χ¯=min{χ¯i,i=1,…,N} and χ=χ0+c0 . According to [34], the definition of V and (60) show that the tracking errors are CSUUB. However, from (60), one gets
ddt(V(t)eχ¯t)≤χeχ¯t.(61)
View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.Integrating both sides of (61), one has
V(t)eχ¯t−V(0)≤∫T0χeχ¯tdt.(62)
View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.Therefore, the following inequality holds:
0≤V(t)≤eχ¯tV(0)+χχ¯(1−e−ϖt).(63)
View Source

Case 2:
ei,1∉Ωei,1 by using Lemma 5 and the fact that ([z21μ0(z21)]/ε)≥0 , and we know that
(1−2tanh2(ei,1v))z21μ0(z21)ε≤0.(64)
View SourceTherefore, (57) is simplified as
V˙≤−χ¯V+χ0.(65)
View SourceNext, one has
0≤V(t)≤eχ¯tV(0)+χ0χ¯(1−e−χ¯t).(66)
View SourceSubsequently, according to the definition of V , (63) and (66), we get
∥e1∥2≤2e−χ¯tV(0)+2χχ¯(1−e−χ¯t).(67)
View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.For ∀ϵ>0 , according the definitions of χ¯ and χ , by selecting the adaptive parameters ci,k, ϰi, γi , and σi,k sufficiently large, we can get
χχ¯≤ϵ22(ι(L+B))2.
View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.Furthermore, according to Lemma 2, as t→∞ , (58) holds. This completes the proof.

Remark 2:
Apparently, (63) and (66) imply that each variable is bounded in the adaptive closed-loop system. Assumption 5 ensures that yd(t) is bounded. Furthermore, zi,1=yi(1≤i≤N) are bounded. θi is a design parameter and θ^i=θi−θ~i ; one can conclude that θ^i is bounded. Because (29) indicates that αi,1 is a continuous function, zi,2=ei,2+αi,1 is also bounded. Obviously, we can easy to testify that all state variables zi,k(t)(3≤k≤ni,i=1,2,…,N) are bounded.

Furthermore, based on [31], we prove that there is a constant t∗>0 satisfying ∀k∈s+,{tk+1−tk}≥t∗ . According to ξi(t)=ϖi(t)−ui(t),∀t∈[tk,tk+1) , we get
ddt|ξi|=sign(ei)ξ˙i≤∣∣ξ˙i∣∣.
View SourceFrom (47) and (57), one has
ϖi(t)=A˙=−A˙(1+β)α˙i,niη^tanh(ei,niαi,niη^τ)+αi,niη^˙τ×(e˙i,niαi,niη^+ei,niα˙i,niη^+ei,niαi,niη^˙)cosh2(ei,niαi,niη^τ)αi,niη^˙tanh(ei,niαi,niη^τ)+r2(1−β)2τe˙i,nicosh2(ei,nir(1−β)τ).(68)
View Source

Since all the signals are globally bounded, for any ℏ≥0 , we can obtain |ϖ˙i(t)|≤ℏ . Based on (3) and (4), ξi=0 and limt→tk+1(ξi(t))=β|ui(t)|+r hold. We can obtain the lower bound of interexecution intervals t∗ satisfying t∗≥(β|ui(t)|+r)/ℏ; hence, the Zeno behavior has been successfully avoided.

SECTION VI.Conclusion
This article mainly focuses on the adaptive neural event-triggered control protocol for a class of nonlinear multiagent systems subject to dead-zone, dynamic disturbance, and unmodeled dynamics in nonaffine pure-feedback form. By applying the property of hyperbolic tangent function, the backstepping technology, and the Lyapunov functionals, a novel event-triggered adaptive neural control protocol has been developed, which reduces the burden of communication. The stability analysis has been shown that all the signals of the closed-loop system remain CSUUB and the tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood near the origin. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm has been illustrated through a simulation example.
