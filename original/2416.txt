This article investigates the adaptive learning control problem for a class of nonlinear autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with unknown uncertainties. The unknown nonlinear functions in the AUVs are approximated by radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs), in which the weight updating laws are designed via gradient descent algorithm. The proposed gradient descent-based control scheme guarantees the semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness (SUUB) of the system and the fast convergence of the weight updating laws. In order to reduce the computational burden during the backstepping control design process, the command-filter-based design technique is incorporated into the adaptive learning control strategy. Finally, simulation studies are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

SECTION I.Introduction
Over the past few decades, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have attracted great attention due to their applications in various underwater tasks [1]–[2][3][4][5][6][7]. For example, AUVs have been extensively used in deep-sea archeology, seafloor mapping, ocean sampling surveillance and reconnaissance, missing airplane wreckage finding in air rescue operations, and so on. The dynamics of AUVs can be described as a coupled equation of planar and diving dynamics, which involves six degrees of freedom (DOFs) [8]. However, the control problems of AUVs are still challenging because of their complex model and complicated working environment, which makes the control systems suffer from unpredictable perturbations.

Nevertheless, by considering the wide applications of AUVs, a lot of scholars have devoted themselves on the investigations of control problems of AUVs. For example, to compensate for the effects of the aforementioned unknown perturbations to system performance, Shen et al. [9] and Peng et al. [10] studied the disturbance observer-based control strategies for nonlinear AUVs, in which active observing technique was utilized. Qiao and Zhang [11] proposed a sliding mode control scheme for nonlinear AUVs, which solves the control problem of AUVs with unknown disturbances from another perspective. Besides, the trajectory tracking, path following, and formation control problems of AUVs have also received considerable attention, and many control strategies have been proposed to cope with these issues. For example, the PID and finite-time output feedback control schemes were proposed for a class of nonlinear decoupled AUVs in [12] and [13], respectively, by which satisfactory trajectory tracking performances are guaranteed. In [14], the path following control problem for nonlinear AUVs suffering from unknown disturbances was investigated, in which a nonsingular terminal sliding mode control strategy was proposed. Milln et al. [15] introduced a novel distributed control method to address the formation control problem for nonlinear AUVs.

It is noticed that the aforementioned control strategies are only applicable for nonlinear AUVs with known model dynamics. However, the accurate model of the AUVs is difficult to obtain in practice. Considering the fact that neural networks (NNs) [16]–[17][18][19][20][21][22] are universal approximators to unknown nonlinear functions of uncertain dynamical systems, many scholars studied the NN-based control strategies for uncertain nonlinear systems. For example, Wang et al. [23], Tong et al. [24], Liu et al. [25], [26] investigated the NN-based adaptive control problems for nonlinear systems with unknown uncertainties. In [23], the adaptive NN control problem for a class of single-input–single-output (SISO) strict-feedback nonlinear systems was investigated, and the radial basis function NNs (RBFNNs) were utilized to estimate the unknown nonlinear functions. Tong et al. [24] considered the effects of stochastic disturbances, and an adaptive NN control strategy for strict-feedback stochastic nonlinear systems was proposed via stochastic small-gain theorem. A barrier Lyapunov function-based adaptive NN control problem for switched systems with unknown uncertainties was first investigated in [25] and [26]. Gao et al. [27] and Dai et al. [28] extended the aforementioned results and investigated more general situations, in which the adaptive NN control problems for a class of uncertain AUVs were studied. The control schemes proposed in [27] and [28] guarantee the convergence of the tracking errors and enrich the application fields of the adaptive NN control method. However, the aforementioned updating laws of the RBFNN weights were derived via adaptive control strategies [29]–[30][31][32][33][34], which can only guarantee the semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness (SUUB) of the estimated weights, while the issue of complexity explosion during the backstepping control design process needs to be further solved.

With above discussions and considering the fast convergence of gradient descent algorithm, we investigate the gradient descent-based adaptive learning control problem for nonlinear AUVs with unknown uncertainties in this article. The advantages of the proposed method are that it avoids the introduction of δ -modification terms, reduces the number of designed parameters, and guarantees the convergence of the estimated weights. Besides, the issue of computational burden caused by iterative derivatives of virtual control signals is also considered, which is effectively solved via command filtering technique.

The rest of this article is organized as follows. The problem formulation in this article and some useful preliminaries are given in Section II. Then, the gradient descent-based adaptive learning controller for nonlinear AUVs with unknown uncertainties is designed in Section III, in which the SUUB of the closed-loop system is guaranteed. In Section IV, a simulation example of AUV is given, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed control method. Finally, a conclusion of this article is given in Section V.

SECTION II.Problem Formulation and Preliminaries
A. System Description
The AUV usually moves in a 3-D space with 6-DOF, whose dynamic model can be described as a group of coupled equations. In order to simplify the control design and stability analysis of such coupled AUVs, the investigations on control problems of AUVs are usually either for planar motion or for diving motion with 3-DOF. In this article, we study the planar motion of AUVs with 3-DOF, whose dynamic model can be described as
⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪x˙=ucos(ψ)−vsin(ψ)y˙=usin(ψ)+vcos(ψ)ψ˙=rν˙=M−1(−C(ν)ν−D(ν)ν+τ)(1)
View Sourcewhere (x,y) and ψ are the position and heading of the AUV in the earth-fixed inertial frame, respectively. ν=[u,v,r]T∈R3 is the vector of velocities in surge (u) , sway (v) , and yaw (r) in the boy-fixed frame. M∈R3×3 is the inertia matrix. C(ν) denotes the matrix of Coriolis and centripetal acceleration. D(ν) represents the damping matrix. τ=[τ1,τ2,τ3]T is the vector of control force. The matrixes M , C(ν) and D(ν) are given by
M=C(ν)=D(ν)=⎡⎣⎢m11000m22m320m23m33⎤⎦⎥⎡⎣⎢00−c13(ν)00−c23(ν)c13(ν)c23(ν)0⎤⎦⎥⎡⎣⎢d11(ν)000d22(ν)d32(ν)0d23(ν)d33(ν)⎤⎦⎥.
View Source

Note that it is usually difficult to determine the accurate parameters of the damping matrix D(ν) . Therefore, during the subsequent control design and stability analysis, we assume the parameters in D(ν) to be unknown.

Define the following Jacobian transformation matrix:
J(η)=⎡⎣⎢cos(ψ)sin(ψ)0−sin(ψ)cos(ψ)0001⎤⎦⎥.(2)
View Source

By substituting (2) into (1), we have
{η˙=J(η)νν˙=M−1(−C(ν)ν−D(ν)ν+τ)(3)
View Sourcewhere η=[x,y,ψ]T∈R3 is the system state vector.

In order to simplify the control design process, the state-space model in (3) instead of (1) will be utilized during the subsequent control design. The objective of this article is to propose an adaptive learning control strategy for the nonlinear AUV (3) such that a satisfactory tracking performance and SUUB of the closed-loop nonlinear system with partly unknown dynamics can be guaranteed.

Remark 1:
AUVs have been extensively used in deep-sea archeology, seafloor mapping, ocean sampling surveillance and reconnaissance, missing airplane wreckage finding in air rescue operations, and so on. Therefore, the investigation on nonlinear AUVs is of essential importance and has received considerable attention. However, it should be noted that the accurate model of the AUVs is difficult to obtain in practice, which makes the accurate-model-based control strategies not applicable.

B. Radial Basis Function Neural Networks
It is known that RBFNN is a powerful universal approximator to unknown nonlinear functions [24]. In this article, the RBFNN is introduced to estimate the effect of uncertain dynamics, whose approximation ability can be summarized as the following lemma.

Lemma 1:
For any given continuous nonlinear function fi(ν) and an arbitrarily positive constant ε¯i , there exists an RBFNN θ^Tiφi(ν) such that the following inequality holds:
supν∈Ω|fi(ν)−θ^Tiφi(ν)|<ε¯i(4)
View Sourcewhere ν denotes the input vector of the RBFNN, θ^i=[θ^i,1,…,θ^i,H]T is the weight vector, and φi(ν)=[φi,1(ν),…,φi,H(ν)]T is the NN basis function. H represents the number of NN nodes.

Gaussian-type basis functions are chosen in this article, which can be described as
φi,j(ν)=exp(−(ν−ci,j)T(ν−ci,j)w2i,j)(5)
View Sourcewhere ci,j is the center vector of the Gaussian function with its width ωi,j . It is obvious that the Gaussian-type basis functions are bounded and satisfy 0<φ¯ij,m≤φi,j(ν)≤φ¯ij,M<1 , where φ¯ij,m and φ¯ij,M are positive constants.

Define the optimal weight vector θ∗i as
θ∗i=argminθ^i∈χ[supν∈Ω∣∣f^i(ν)−fi(ν)∣∣](6)
View Sourcewhere f^i(ν)=θ^Tiφi(ν) is the output of the RBFNN.

Then, the minimum approximation error is
εi=fi(ν)−f^∗i(ν)=fi(ν)−θ∗Tiφi(ν)(7)
View Sourcewhich satisfies |εi|≤ε¯i .

Remark 2:
In this article, the updating laws of the NN weights are obtained via a gradient descent-based adaptive learning algorithm, which will be given later. A block diagram of the proposed control scheme is given in Fig. 1.

C. Command Filtering
In order to reduce the computational burden caused by the iterative derivatives of virtual control signals during the backstepping control design process, the following command filtering technique is utilized.

For an arbitrary δi>0 and a given input signal αi,1 satisfying |α˙i,1|≤α¯i,1 and |α(2)i,1|≤α––i,1 , where α¯i,1 and α––i,1 are positive constants, there exist βi>0 and 0<κi≤1 such that the following equations hold:
{λ˙i,1=βiλi,2λ˙i,2=−2κiβiλi,2−βi(λi,1−αi,1)(8)
View Sourcewhere λi,1 is the output of the command filter with i=1,2,3 . Then, we can conclude that |λi,1−αi,1|≤δi , |λ˙i,1| , |λ(2)i,1| , |λ(3)i,1| are all bounded with initial conditions λi,1(0)=αi,1(0) , λi,2(0)=0 .

Command filtering technique reduces the computational burden during the backstepping control design process but also brings errors between x2,c=[λ1,1,λ2,1,λ3,1]T and α1=[α1,1,α2,1,α3,1]T , which may affect the output tracking performance. To overcome this problem, in Section III, the error compensating vectors ξ1 and ξ2 will be introduced.

Remark 3:
In this article, we proposed a gradient descent-based adaptive learning control method for nonlinear AUVs with unknown uncertainties. Compared with the traditional adaptive control scheme, the advantages of the method proposed in this article are summarized as follows.

The traditional adaptive control strategies can only guarantee the SUUB of the estimated RBFNN weights. However, the fast convergence of the weights can be achieved via adaptive learning control scheme.

Compared with the traditional adaptive control design process, the utilization of gradient descent-based adaptive learning control design technique avoids the introduction of δ -modification terms and thus reduces the number of designed parameters.

SECTION V.Conclusion
This article investigates the gradient descent-based adaptive learning control problem for a class of nonlinear AUVs with unknown uncertainties via command filtering technique. The gradient descent algorithm proposed in this article guarantees the convergence of the RBFNN weights and avoids the introduction of δ -modification terms. Besides, by considering the differences between the outputs of command filters and virtual control signals, an error compensating strategy is proposed, which further improves the performance of the control scheme. Simulation studies on the nonlinear AUV show the satisfactory tracking performance and the boundedness of the closed-loop system signals. By considering the restriction of the current modeling technique and the system dynamic changes due to unknown disturbances, one of our future research is the investigation of model-free-based adaptive learning control problem for AUVs.
