Image annotation has been an active research in computer vision. Most of the prior research works focus on annotating images with fixed number of labels, while it is unreasonable to annotate all images with the same number of labels and do not take into consideration their contents. In this paper, we present an extensive survey on the recent works about image annotation with label-to-image semantic relevance and propose a general framework for image adaptive annotation. Compared to previous works on image annotation methods, the proposed framework is novel in the following aspects: (1) It predicts label numbers of each image according to its visual features, which is more reasonable and practical for real-world image annotation. (2) It models label-to-image relevance with similar images and related labels, which can generate abundant candidate labels. (3) It can progressively refine the image label sets, which ensures the selected label set to be truly representative and with few redundancies. Experimental results on two benchmark multi-label image annotation datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Introduction
As an important and useful research topic in multimedia and computer vision fields, automatic image annotation aims at describing the contents of images with a set of semantic labels, which has attracted lots of researchers’ interest. It is not only helpful to understand the semantics of images, but also widely used in various applications of digital image processing, such as image retrieval [25, 50] and caption generation [5]. Automatic image annotation well bridges semantic gaps between low-level features used to represent images and high-level semantic labels used to reflect image contents. On the other hand, due to the complex semantic relationship between image content and labels, label noises, etc., it is still a challenging task [36, 52].

A great number of approaches have been developed for automatic image annotation. Some early search-based annotation methods [16, 29, 36] mainly focused on image-to-label relevance, which tagged an image with labels of its semantic neighborhoods. How to measure the similarity between images is a key problem and many techniques have been proposed to deal with relations between images [53] such as search paradigms and visual similarity. Recently, image annotation was considered as a multi-label learning and classification problem with the help of deep learning methods [27, 28, 51]. Each label was assumed to be an individual category, and models can output some of labels with a series of pre-trained classifiers. And because of its simplicity and efficiency, some label classification methods have been widely used for annotation.

Different from the mutually exclusive image categories in classification, the labels in the scene are highly related. And how to integrate the relationships and encourage the diversity between labels to improve model performance becomes a new trend [14, 18]. There are a variety of methods, such as directed graphs [10, 46] and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [41], that have been used to reveal the co-occurrence relations between labels and obtained satisfactory annotation results. In addition, some other intuitive semantic relationship within labels, such as hierarchical structure (”vehicle” includes ”car”), synonymous relationship(”people” and ”person”), which can be used to refine label and output more descriptive label sets [26, 43, 45, 47].

Kulesza et al. [22] proposed a conditional determinant point process (DPP) model, which models the probability distribution of a fixed-size label subset and then integrates the global negative correlation between the elements in the subset to ensure the diversity among them. Therefore, in order to ensure labels diversity, some image annotation methods embed the label relationship in the DPP model [43, 45]. These works assumed that all images have the same number of labels and set a fixed label length k.

Many other works [28, 41, 44, 48] also evaluated their performance using top-k retrieval performance, where k is fixed at 3 or 5. This assumption gives convenience for comparing performance between different methods, but it does not take into account the difference among semantic complexity of each image [20]. It is well known that the number of ground-truth labels increases with the complexity of the image content. As shown in Fig. 1a and b, the labels statistics on two widely used image annotation data sets(IAPRTC-12 and ESP-Game) are quite- different. Figure 1c and d gives some examples of annotated results. Conventional annotation algorithms are not effective in case of imbalanced label distribution. We found that images with salient foregrounds are more likely to be encoded with dominant objects, such as “bottle” or “tree”. While for some complicated images, humans usually would like to depict them with more labels. Therefore, it is more practical to tagging images with different numbers of labels according to their contents. Predicting the number of labels in images and tagging them with variable length labels can make a good balance between the diversity and accuracy of image annotation.

Considering the diversity of the label subset and labels refinement, we propose an adaptive image annotation (AIA) method which progressively refines labels according to image contents and label relations. The model consists of three components: Label Length Prediction, Label-to-Image Relevance and Diverse Subset Inference. First, we use a pre-trained Inception-ResNet-V2 [35] as a feature extractor and predict the number of labels according to the feature distribution. Then, we give a model to simulate the label-to-image relevance with visual similarity and semantic relationship. Given an image to be labeled, we can get its diverse candidate label set which consists of related labels from its similar images. Finally, we use the WordNet-based weighted semantic paths as prior knowledge to refine labels.

Our main contributions are threefold: (i) We design an Label Length Prediction module to predict the variable label length of the image in line with the semantic information of the image. The predicted number of labels is more consistent with the actual tagging task. (ii) We use similar images and related labels to calculate the correlation between images and labels, and get a highly correlated and rich candidate labels set. (iii) We propose a new annotation method that treats image annotation as a label subset selection problem, which combines the label semantic path and the sampling algorithm to select representative variable-length labels from the candidate labels. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, experimental results on ablation analysis, as well as performance, in comparison with several state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets are reported.

Image annotation with image-to-label relevance
The primary goal of the image annotation methods with image-to-label relevance is to model the visual and textual relationship [1]. There are many methods that focus on image-to-label relevance to improve annotation accuracy, which can be broadly divided into generative models, nearest neighbor models and discriminative models [7].

Generative models aim to learn a joint distribution over image context features and semantic labels, and then predict the conditional probability of the label for the image to be labeled. Jeon et al. [19] proposed a cross media relevance model (CMRM), which clustered the segmented image blocks into blobs and learned the joint probability distribution between blobs and semantic labels to deduce a set of labels with the greatest correlation to the image. The model proposed in [11] was the joint probability distribution of labels and feature vectors from multiple image rectangular regions. They also used multiple Bernoulli model to estimate the predicted probability of each label. Foumani et al. [12] combined Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC) to generate more informative visual words. To deal with label imbalance, they used a set of trained parameters to weight each label. The tr-mmLDA model [34] presented a topic-regression multi-modal Latent Dirichlet Allocation method, which incorporated a linear regression module to correlate two hidden topics of images and texts. It could capture correlations between image features and annotation texts.

Nearest neighbor models assume that visual similar images are much likely to share same labels, so the keywords of the nearest image can be assigned to the input test image. Makadia et al. [31] exploited the distances between unlabeled image and the labeled training images, and then assigned the labels of its nearest neighbors with a greedy algorithm. Li et al. [24] efficiently measured the label importance weight for each image by accumulating votes from visual neighbors’ label distribution. In [15], the authors adopted logistic discriminant and weighted nearest neighbor algorithm to increase the importance of infrequent labels and suppress frequent labels. Verma et al. [39] proposed a 2-pass k-nearest neighbor algorithm with image-to-label and image-to-image similarities to optimize image annotation. Verma et al. [38] studied the diverse image annotation with missing labels (DIAML), which assumed that the training data to be partially labelled, and then annotate test images with a fixed number of labels that are simultaneously diverse, representative and maximally relevant. For DIAML task, they also proposed a new k-nearest neighbor (k-NN)-based algorithm, which used the Bernoulli process to indicate whether the label present and placed a Gaussian kernel over the image’ feature map to calculate the similarity between images. Ma et al. [30] incorporated a multi-label linear discriminant classification method to assign different weights to image features, which acquired the k-nearest neighbors of the image more accurately. Wu et al. [42] used WordNet [9] to expand the candidate label set of unlabeled images obtained based on KNN, which pay more attention to the semantic correlations among textual labels.

Discriminative models treat each label as a class and learn an binary classifier for each label. Yu et al. [49] proposed the traditional low rank empirical risk minimization framework to learn the parameters of multi-label classifier by minimizing the empirical loss. In [4], the author trained two classifiers to evaluate image and label independently, and ensemble them into agreement via co-regularization in a joint loss function. With the development of deep learning, some annotation models use CNN to extract image feature with different convolution kernels and then use them to a classifier at the last layer. Niu et al. [32] proposed a multi-scale deep CNN model for fusing rich and discriminative features at different layers, which was effective for representing a wide range of visual concepts. Ke et al. [21] proposed an end-to-end feature pyramid annotation model. And a multi-label data enhancement method based on Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) was proposed to reduce the over-fitting problem of small-scale datasets.

Image annotation with label relations
There are important and complex relationships between semantic labels, such as co-occurrence (e.g., ”car” and ”road”) or semantic hierarchical relationship (e.g., ”clothes” and ”sweater”). Based on the above prior knowledge, label relationships can provide semantic clues for inferring label.

Some methods consider the co-occurrence relationship between labels, they either predict the labels in a sequential fashion or construct graph model based on label dependency. For example, Chen et al. [6] constructed a directed graph with the specified vertices and edges, where each node is a label and each edge weight is the label co-occurrence probability between a pair of label. And, they used Graph Convolution Network (GCN) to map this label graphs to a set of inter-dependent label classifiers. Jin et al. [20] proposed a RIA model that forms image annotation problem as a sequence label generation, in which CNN was used to encode image as a visual feature vector and then RNN is utilized to decode the visual feature into a series of labels. It is the first work for very rare image annotations with arbitrary number of labels. However, the performance of RIA varies with the label order given in the training phase and rare-first order outperforms than dictionary order, random order, frequent-first order, and so on. However, it is not practical and difficult to rank labels in a order for a given sets of unlabeled images.

WordNet [9] is another method for describing semantic relationship between labels, which use multi-layer hierarchical structure to represent similar cluster, relations and sub-relations. The synonymous and hierarchical relationships included in WordNet can serve image annotation. Wu et al. [47] proposed a mixed graph to encode three kinds of label dependencies. It incorporates instance-level label similarity and class co-occurrence as undirected edges while semantic hierarchy is used as directed edges. This unified model performs well especially for dealing with noisy and missing labels. Lately, Wu et al. [45] proposed a diverse image annotation (DIA) model, which was the first work to encode the image-to-label correlation and the semantic relationship of labels in a DPP [23] sampling process. Furthermore, they constructed the hierarchical relationship of labels into weighted semantic paths to guide the model to sample the most diverse label subset from fixed-length labels set. Then, in [43], they optimized the DPP sampling process with a GAN to measure the relevance of image features and label sets. Chacko et al. [2] predicted the 5 category labels with the highest confidence based on CNN and then retrieved other semantic information about class labels among them through WordNet, such as hyponyms, hypernyms and their semantic similarity, which help in accurately tagging images.

Adaptive image annotation
Our AIA method mainly contains three modules: Label Length Prediction (LLP), Label-to-Image Relevance (LIR) and Diverse Subset Inference (DSI). We present more details of these three parts in the following subsections.

Given an image, we first utilize a pre-trained Inception-ResNet-V2 model to predict the number of labels according its contents. In order to make full use of the image-to-label relevance, we perform a content-based image retrieval and obtain plentiful candidate labels subsets which come from the labels of its similar image. We try to measure the similarity between images with the help of deep learning features. And then we embed image-to-labels relevance from the similar images and the related labels into the DPP model to optimize candidate labels. Finally, we utilize weighted semantic paths as semantic clue to sample more representative subset from candidate labels and obtain diverse labels as output. The flowchart of the proposed framework is shown in Fig. 2.

Notation Assume that 𝐴={𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑐} denotes the c possible annotation labels. The training image set is denoted as 𝑋=[𝑥1,…,𝑥𝑛], where 𝑥𝑗∈𝑅𝑑 denotes d dimensional feature vector of the 𝑗𝑡ℎ image, which extracted with some pre-trained deep learning models such as VGG and ResNet [45]. 𝑦𝑗,𝑦𝑗˜ represent the ground-truth and predicted label sets of the 𝑗𝑡ℎ image, respectively. And 𝑔𝑗 represents the ground-truth number of the labels, 𝑔𝑗˜ represents the predicted labels length, i.e. 𝑔𝑗=|𝑦𝑗|,𝑔𝑗˜=|𝑦𝑗˜|.

Label length prediction
We notice that images with salient objects can be described with a small number of labels, while complex ones may require more labels to depict their confusing contents. The statistics about label distribution of two benchmark datasets ESP-Game and IAPRTC-12 are shown in Table 1. The total number of image labels in two datasets ESP-Game and IAPRTC-12 are 268 and 291, respectively. From the table, we can see that the maximum number of image label is 23. The standard deviation indicates a big number variation between images even in a same image dataset.

Table 1 Statistics of images and labels in two datasets
Full size table
In order to establish the relationship between image content and label length, we formulate label length prediction as a regression problem. Therefore, we replace the final classification layer in Inception-ResNet-V2 [35] with three fully connected layers to solve the regression task. Given an image 𝑥𝑗∈ℜ𝐻×𝑊×3, the modified Inception-ResNet-V2 is expected to extract the semantic information of the image. The output of the last fully connected layer specified as an integer value 𝑔˜𝑗is provided as the predicted number of the image labels. We train the model to minimize Mean Squared Error (MSE), defined as follows:

𝑀𝑆𝐸=1𝑛∑𝑗=1𝑛(𝑔˜𝑗−𝑔𝑗)2
(1)
where 𝑔𝑗 is the ground-truth labels length, and n represents the number of images in the training set.

We adjust the size of all inputs images to 229×229, the learning rate is 1×10−4, the decay is 1×10−6, and batch size is 32. We also use the training sets of two datasets ESP-Game and IAPRTC-12 shown in Table 1 for training the LLP module, in which the label number for input image is set to the expected output.

Image-to-Label relevance
In this section, we exploit the relationships between image and label sets. Different from existed methods, the relevance in this section take both image visual features and label sets of similar images into consideration.

We consider the label associations between similar images firstly. Images are grouped together to c image subsets 𝑀=[𝑀1,…,𝑀𝑐] according to their labels. Given an image, we build its semantic image set 𝑍𝑀 by selecting the most K similar images from each cluster (according to its labels) in M, 𝑍𝑀 consists of at most 𝑐∗𝑘 images. Here, we propose a deep learning method to measure the similarity between image pairs. The Euclidean distance of combined deep features extracted by the 𝐹𝑉𝐺𝐺−𝐹,𝐹𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑁𝑒𝑡,𝐹𝑉𝐺𝐺−6,𝐹𝑉𝐺𝐺−7 is used to boost similarity accuracy. Then, we use parameter W to represent the correlation of image features to labels, this relevance 𝑊=[𝑤1,…,𝑤𝑐]∈𝑅𝑑×𝑐 learned from training data by minimizing the negative log likelihood with ℓ2 regularization [45]. It can be obtained the optimization problem as follows:

𝐸(𝑊)=−1𝑛∑𝑗=1𝑛log𝑃𝑊(𝑦𝑗|𝑥𝑗)+𝜂2∑𝑖=1𝑐‖𝑤𝑖‖22
(2)
where 𝑃𝑊 is the conditional DPP model, the sampling probability of the label subset is obtained through it. The parametric DPP is formulated as follows [23]:

𝑃𝑊(𝑦|𝑥)=det(𝐿𝑦(𝑥;𝑊))det(𝐿(𝑥;𝑊)+𝐼)
(3)
where I is an identity matrix, det(⋅) means the determinant calculation. 𝐿(𝑥;𝑊)∈𝑅𝑐×𝑐 is a positive semi-definite kernel matrix. The sub-matrix 𝐿𝑦(𝑥;𝑊)=[𝐿𝑖,𝑜(𝑥;𝑊)𝑎𝑖,𝑎𝑜∈𝑦] is generated by selecting the rows and columns of L(x; W) according to the label indexes in y:

𝐿𝑖,𝑜(𝑥;𝑊)=𝑞𝑖(𝑥)∗𝑆𝐴(𝑖,𝑜)∗𝑞𝑜(𝑥),∀𝑖,𝑜∈𝐴
(4)
where 𝑆𝐴(𝑖,𝑜) is the semantic similarity between label 𝑎𝑖 and 𝑎𝑜 which can be calculated by the following equation:

𝑆𝐴(𝑖,𝑜)=12+⟨𝑡𝑖,𝑡𝑜⟩‖𝑡𝑖‖2‖𝑡𝑜‖2,∀𝑖,𝑜∈𝐴
(5)
where 𝑡𝑖,𝑡𝑜∈𝑅300 is the representation vector of labels 𝑎𝑖,𝑎𝑜 obtained by Glove [33]. Moreover, ⟨𝑡𝑖,𝑡𝑜⟩ denotes the inner product between 𝑡𝑖 and 𝑡𝑜, ‖⋅‖2 means the ℓ2 norm of a vector. And in Eq.(4), 𝑞𝑖(𝑥) is used to measure the relevance between label 𝑎𝑖 and input image x, which is defined as:

𝑞𝑖(𝑥)=𝜇exp(0.5𝑤𝑇𝑖𝑥)+(1−𝜇)∑𝑀exp(−𝐷(𝑥,𝑍𝑀)𝛿(𝑎𝑖,𝑍𝑀))
(6)
where the former part of Eq. (6) mainly focuses on the relevance of image features and labels. The later part of Eq. (6) focuses on similar images share the same labels. 𝐷(𝑥,𝑍𝑀) is the Euclidean distance of features between image x and its similar image that in the subset 𝑍𝑀. An indicator function 𝛿(𝑎𝑖,𝑍𝑀) takes a value 1 if similar image 𝑍𝑀 contains the label 𝑎𝑖 and 0 otherwise. The parameter 𝜇∈(0,1) trades off image’s visual information and image’s neighbor label information, and can be selected by doing cross-validation in training set. In fact, when 𝜇=1, Eq. (6) is a special case given in [45].

For each image 𝑥𝑗 , we can get the correlation information 𝑞𝑖(𝑥𝑗) between 𝑥𝑗 and each label i with Eq. (6). We rank this vector and select the top ⌈1.5∗𝑔˜𝑗⌉ labels as the candidate labels set of image 𝑥𝑗, denoted as 𝑦¯𝑗, in which 𝑔˜𝑗 is the label length predicted by the LLP module.

Diverse subset inference
From the section 3.2, we can obtain abundant candidate labels 𝑦¯𝑗 of each image. However, there may be some redundancy in these candidate labels. We should delete some labels and keep their integrity and descriptive at the same time. According to this, we explore the weight of each label in the coarse subset with the help of WordNet [9]. Given a particular subset, we can traverse the WordNet network to find semantic hierarchy (”pant” is a piece of ”clothes”) or synonyms (”people” and ”person” have the same meaning) with related meanings.

Weighted semantic paths are constructed based on the hierarchical relationship among all candidate labels [45]. Figure 3a shows a part of hierarchical relations between labels. Let [”clothes,” ”trouser,” ”sweater,” ”pant,” ”pullover”] denote the complete vocabulary of candidate labels. Their weights are closely related the semantic paths shown in Fig. 3b. Using WordNet, we can build directed paths such as [“clothes,” → “sweater” → ”pullover”] and [“clothes,” → “pant” ]. We encode each node i in a path with a triple set (𝑎𝑖,𝑙,𝑎𝑖,𝑑,𝑎𝑖,𝑏), which represent its layer, the number of descendants and weight, respectively. The weight of each label 𝑎𝑖 in a given semantic path depends on the level of the label and the number of descendants labels of the label. For example, in semantic paths [“clothes,” → “sweater” → “pullover”], ”pullover” in bottom layers is a leaf node without descendant labels, and the weight of leaf node is set to 1. The weight of non-leaf node 𝑎𝑖 in the semantic path is defined as:

𝑎𝑖,𝑏=𝜏𝑎𝑖,𝑙𝑎𝑖,𝑑
(7)
where the factor 𝜏=0.7 [45]. So, ”clothes” in the left semantic path can be represented as (2,4,0.1225), which indicates that ”clothes” is in the second layer, has four descendant labels in total, and its weight in this semantic path is 0.1225=0.72/4.

For a given label set, there are many semantic paths, which are represented by 𝐻𝐴={𝐻1,…,𝐻𝑟}. Although different paths may share labels, the weight of same label in different path may varies according to their level and descendants. For a given label, we add up all weights in the related semantic paths to get the final weight of the label. And then the weight of all labels can be denoted as 𝐵=(𝑎1,𝑏,…,𝑎𝑖,𝑏,…,𝑎𝑐,𝑏).

AIA sampling algorithm
Algorithm 1 is a modified version of the standard k-DPP sampling algorithm [23], by embedding the LLP module in Line 1, Image-to-Label Relevance module in Line 2-3, and weighted semantic paths in Line 7-9. Given an unlabeled image, we use the LLP model to obtain the number of labels 𝑔𝑗˜ and also use the extracted CNN features to retrieval similar images from the training set and named as 𝑍𝑀. Then, we can get 1.5∗𝑔˜𝑗 candidate labels with Eq. (6) according the image and label relevance. Subsequently, the k-DPP sampling algorithm and weight semantic paths are used to refine the coarse label set, as shown in Line 7-19. Line 9-11 ensures that two labels in the same semantic path will not be selected together. We run 10 samplings to obtain 10 different label subsets. Finally, we select the subset with the largest sum of label weights in the 10 sampling process as the optimal label set 𝑦𝑗˜.

Experiments
Experimental setting
Datasets. We use two benchmark image annotation datasets IAPRTC-12 and ESP-Game for experiment comparison. The IAPRTC-12 [13] dataset consists of 19627 images and there are 291 labels. The minimum and maximum number of image labels are 1 and 23 respectively. The ESP-Game [40] dataset includes a wide variety of images that consist of drawings, logos, personal photos, etc. There are 20770 images and the size of vocabulary is 268. The minimum label length of training images is 1 and the maximum is 15. For both datasets, we follow the training/test partition used in the normal way [37]. Some statistics of these datasets are shown in Table 2.

Comparison methods. We compare the annotation results of our method with five state-of-the-art image annotation methods including LEML [49], MLMG [47], DIA [45], D2-GAN [43] and RIA [20]. The first four methods were proposed for predicting fixed number of label sets, and the last one is the baseline for variable length image annotation. The comparison experiments conducted according to the two conditions: Annotate image with the given the number of labels(3 or 5 as normal) and annotate with different number of labels. Because RIA method did not report results of fixed number tags, we do not compare with RIA in the first comparison experiment. We revise the first four method LEML, MLMG, DIA, D2-GAN with our proposed LLP module and named as LEML-LLP, MLMG-LLP, DIA-LLP, D2-GAN-LLP, respectively.

RestNet152 [17], VGG16 [8] and VGG-F [3] are three widely used networks for image feature extraction [35]. DIA and D2-GAN used pre-trained VGG-F model to extract a 4096-dimensional feature vector and got satisfactory results. Thus, for a fair comparison, we also use this model to extract the same dimensional features to measure image similarity and the corresponding method was named as AIA-Single. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of higher dimensional feature vector, which obtained with pre-trained VGG-F, VGG16 and RestNet152. We measure image similarity based on the combined features and keep the remaining steps same as AIA-Single, the corresponding method named as AIA-Mix.

Metrics. The standard metrics are precision, recall, and F1-measure, which are widely used in previous work. The corresponding semantic metrics based on weighted semantic paths, proposed by Wu et al. [45], can be used to evaluate relevancy and diversity more meaningful and precise. The semantic metrics are computed as follows:

𝑆𝑃𝑗=∣∣𝐻𝑦𝑗⋂𝐻𝑦˜𝑗∣∣∣∣𝐻𝑦˜𝑗∣∣
(8)
𝑆𝑅𝑗=∣∣𝐻𝑦𝑗⋂𝐻𝑦˜𝑗∣∣∣∣𝐻𝑦𝑗∣∣
(9)
𝑆𝐹1𝑗=2(𝑆𝑃𝑗×𝑆𝑅𝑗)(𝑆𝑃𝑗+𝑆𝑅𝑗)
(10)
where H represents the semantic paths, |⋅| represents the number of semantic paths. |𝐻𝑦𝑗⋂𝐻𝑦˜𝑗| is the weight of correct labels. SP, SR and SF1 are the average metrics value of all images in the dataset. The higher value indicates the better performance of the method.

Effective evaluation for LLP
We quantify the efficiency of LLP for labels number prediction with two metrics, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Accuracy. We choose the number of tags for each image 𝑔𝑗 as a reference and use metrics to demonstrate the difference between fixed number(3 or 5) and predicted variable number. The former metric is the mean absolute error between the predicted quantities and ground-truth quantities, and the later metric is the proportion of correct predicted quantities in all testing images. The MAE and Accuracy are defined as follows:

𝑀𝐴𝐸=1𝑛∑𝑗=1𝑛∣∣𝑔𝑗˜−𝑔𝑗∣∣
(11)
𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦=1𝑛∑𝑗=1𝑛𝛿(𝑔𝑗˜,𝑔𝑗)
(12)
For fixed label numbers, we do not use LLP to predict the number of labels and assume the predicted quantity 𝑔𝑗˜=3 or 𝑔𝑗˜=5, and indicator function 𝛿(𝑔𝑗˜,𝑔𝑗) takes value 1 if 𝑔𝑗˜=𝑔𝑗, otherwise 0.

The MAE and Accuracy results of the LLP predicted label length and the traditional fixed label length are shown in Table 2. From statistics of image datasets, the average label number of testing images on the ESP-Game and IAPRTC-12 datasets are 4.6 and 5.6, respectively. It means that fixed label number 5 is closer to average number compare to 3-labels, and MAE and Accuracy values of 5-labels should be higher than those of 3-labels. Moreover, the MAE and Accuracy values with LLP are much better than 5-labels. We can make a conclusion that our quantity prediction is more in accordance with the ground-truth quantity than conventional fixed-length.

Comparison of models with fixed label length
According to most of the annotation methods proposed for a fixed number of labels k, we also adjust our method to let the model predict a given number of labels. Our method is compared with four image annotation methods that utilize label relationships, including LEML, MLMG, DIA, and D2-GAN. It should be noted that DIA, D2-GAN and our approach utilized diverse subset inference to ensure labels diversity. The main difference between DIA and AIA-Single is that DIA only used the first half of Eq. (6).

We present semantic metrics results of the proposed model on two benchmark datasets, which are shown in Tables 3 and 4. The first three lines are the reported results in [45], and the fourth line is reported results in [43]. It is evident that our AIA method exhibits superior performance for both 3 and 5 labels on two datasets. In the 5-tags evaluation, compared with D2-GAN, SF1 score of AIA-Single increases 2.02% and 4.55% on ESP-Game and IAPRTC-12, respectively. And, compared with DIA, SF1 score of AIA-Single increases 2.12% and 4.73% on two datasets, respectively. The reason maybe the kernel matrix measures robust relevance between images and labels, and it can generate more correct and diverse candidate labels. Moreover, in the 5-tags evaluation, compared with AIA-Single, the SF1 scores of AIA-Mix on the two datasets are increased by 2.79% and 4.46%, respectively. This shows that multiple CNN-based features can boost AIA to achieve better performance than a single CNN-based feature. Also, our method has more improvements on IAPRTC-12 because the ESP-Game dataset is more challenging than IAPRTC-12.

Comparison of models with variable label length
Our method is first compared with the published results of the RIA method, which is a method for predicting variable length labels. Then, our method is compared with the LEML, MLMG, and DIA methods that use our label length prediction as a priori knowledge. For convenience, we renamed three methods to LEML-LLP, MLMG-LLP and DIA-LLP.

RIA is influenced by label sequence order and provided four results in different rules. For a fair comparison, we use the same precise, recall and F1-score metrics to measure our method, and the results are presented in Table 5. On ESP-Game dataset, AIA-Single-LLP outperforms RIA in frequent-first order and random order. On IAPRTC-12 dataset, AIA-Single-LLP outperforms RIA in frequent-first order, random order and rare-first order. Especially, AIA-Mix-LLP outperforms RIA in four orders, F1-Score of AIA-Mix-LLP increases 1.5% and 4.6% than the best result of RIA on ESP-Game and IAPRTC-12, respectively.

And then, our method is compared with LEML-LLP, MLMG-LLP and DIA-LLP, which use the result of label length prediction as a priori. The semantic metrics results of these methods are shown in Table 6. It can be seen that our method achieves better performance in multiple metrics. Compared with DIA-LLP, from semantic SF1 score, AIA-Single-LLP increases 1.95% and 4.75% on ESP-Game and IAPRTC-12, respectively. Compared with AIA-Single-LLP, SF1 score of AIA-Mix-LLP increases 2.82% and 4.84% on ESP-Game and IAPRTC-12, respectively. At the same time, we can compare the SF1 of AIA-mix in Tables 3–4 and SF1 of AIA-mix-LLP in Table 6 to infer the effectiveness of LLP in our method.

Moreover, we further count the number of images of methods at different SF1 scores, and results are shown in Fig. 4. When SF1 score is larger than 0.5, our method contains more images compared to other methods. While SF1 score is lower than 0.5, our method contains less images.

Finally, we show mean SF1 scores of methods at different number of ground-truth labels in testing images, and the results are presented in Fig. 5. The overall trend is that as number of ground-truth labels increases, so does SF1 scores. Moreover, it can be seen that our method outperforms other methods when the predicted labels are variable.

Also, several image annotation results of four methods are shown in Fig. 6. Labels in bold are consistent with ground-truth labels. Look for the first image in Fig. 6, ”a statue of a man on a grey base,” MLMG predicted three labels are ”adult,” ”people,” and ”person,” they are related to ”man.” However, predicted labels of MLMG exist redundancy. DIA predicted three labels are ”statue,” ”sky,” and ”man.” And our method predicted four labels are ”statue,” ”base,” ”front,” and ”man.” Both DIA and our method predicted more diverse labels than MLMG, but our method predicted more correct labels than DIA, especially our method predicted four labels as same as the number of ground-truth label length.

Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a variable length annotation model with diversity. Different from the conventional methods, our methods can generate label subsets with variable length according to the complexity of image semantics. The label quantity subproblem was solved by CNN architecture with regress layers. Furthermore, in order to avoid label redundancy, our method construct a robust label-to-image relevance to obtain the candidate labels, and then the optimal labels were decided from this candidate labels via weighted semantic paths. In order to evaluate the performance of our method, we first compare the proposed method with some state-of-the-art methods under the conventional fixed-length evaluation setting on two datasets. And then, our method is compared with the published results of RIA, which generated label sequence with variable length. Finally, we compared with several methods that use our label quantity as prior knowledge. From the experimental results on two datasets, our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.
