An extreme learning machine (ELM)-based field-oriented feedback linearization speed control (ELMFOFLC) is proposed to enhance the robustness and tracking performance of a permanent magnetic synchronous motor (PMSM) system. First, the field-oriented control (FOC) is adopted to control the electromagnetic torque and the stator magnetic flux of PMSM independently with a detailed discussion on effects especially brought by the model parameter uncertainties on a FOC-based PMSM model. Then, three field-oriented feedback linearization controllers (FOFLCs) are designed to control the electromagnetic torque loop, the stator magnetic flux loop and the outer speed loop, respectively, and cancel nonlinearities in these three loops. Furthermore, a specific ELM is proposed based on the analysis of the characteristics and the uncertainties of PMSM with FOFLC. The stability is proved using the Lyapunov method. Finally, comprehensive simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed control is robust to various uncertainties with a superior speed tracking performance.

Introduction
The PMSM systems have many merits for lots of high-precision applications including machine tools and industrial robots, due to their efficiency, reliability, superior controllability, high torque-to-mass ratio, etc. [1,2,3,4]. Employing converter-fed-based variable speed drives (VSDs) is a new trend to regulate PMSM systems [1, 3]. Both of the cascaded control structure [1,2,3,4] and the non-cascaded control structure [5] can be found in PMSM control with VSDs [1].

It is well known that the field-oriented-based model of PMSM is still nonlinear and it is difficult to design controllers for a nonlinear model. Therefore, feedback linearization is used as an efficient way to compensate for the nonlinearity of the PMSM model [1,2,3]. Compared with the Jacobian linearization at an operating point method [4], the feedback linearization is a generalized and global linearization. After the PMSM model is linearized, linear controllers including state feedback control [1, 4] have been readily designed to control PMSMs.

Although the deterministic nonlinearity of the PMSM model can be handled with feedback linearization, the uncertainty including model uncertainty, external disturbances and model parameter uncertainties is difficult to avoid completely. Many studies develop control algorithms to overcome negative effects brought by uncertainties [6,7,8,9,10]. On the one hand, some of these control strategies can resist a wide range of uncertainties, but they sacrifice the servo performance significantly. On the other hand, the adaptive control can keep a superb servo performance, but it has a poor range of robustness to uncertainties. The disturbance observer-based control or disturbance uncertainty estimation and attenuation (DUEA) techniques play more and more important roles for handling disturbances and uncertainties in recent years because they provide a promising approach for trading off between the servo performance and the robustness [4, 11, 12].

Among a large number of different disturbance observers, the neural network approach is well known for its estimation of nonlinear functions including complex uncertainties [13,14,15,16,17] and has been applied to motor control [18,19,20]. The extreme learning machine (ELM) is a kind of single-hidden-layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) which has an extremely fast learning speed with randomly chosen hidden layer parameters [21]. The ELM can approximate a nonlinear function over a compact set with arbitrary accuracy [8, 21] and has been used in motion control [18, 22,23,24,25]. In [18], the study proposes an ELM to estimate the upper bound of the lumped uncertainty without prior knowledge and then the fast nonsingular terminal sliding mode controller is established with the ELM to achieve the global stability and finite-time convergence for an automotive electronic throttle system. In [22], an ELM is used to modify the hidden node parameters of SLFN. Then, a sliding mode controller is designed to improve the robustness of nonlinear systems. In [23], an ELM is adopted to generate hidden nodes of SLFN, which is used to identify the lumped uncertainty in unmanned surface vehicles. The study in [24] establishes an ELM to compensate for the unknown nonlinearity in a robot manipulator. In [25], an ELM is utilized to estimate and compensate for various uncertainties in a brushless DC servo motor including parameter uncertainties and backlash.

There are many prominent advantages of employing the ELM to estimate and compensate for uncertainties [18, 25]. Firstly, the hidden layer parameters can be randomly chosen. Secondly, an adaptive learning coefficient designed through the Lyapunov method is able to update output weights without a slow learning process which occurs in many traditional neural networks. Finally, no prior knowledge of uncertainties is required in the ELM after its input nodes are determined.

An ELM-based field-oriented feedback linearization control (ELMFOFLC) for a PMSM system is proposed in this paper to enhance its robustness and tracking performance. The contributions of this paper are highlighted as follows:

(1)
Uncertainty effects to the FOC-based PMSM model are analyzed, and some results are used before designing the ELM.

(2)
Three FOFLCs are designed for the electromagnetic torque loop, the stator magnetic flux loop and the outer speed loop, which are named as the Iq loop, the Id loop and the ωe loop, respectively. These controllers decrease the boundary of the lumped uncertainty and improve the servo performance by cancelling the nonlinearity in PMSM.

(3)
A specific ELM is proposed to estimate the lumped uncertainty in the speed loop after the uncertainty analysis of the FOFLC-based PMSM, in which the lumped uncertainty can be updated adaptively, leading to a well-controlled robustness.

The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 analyzes the uncertainty effects of the FOC-based PMSM. Section 3 presents the ELMFOFLC and proves the stability of the proposed control. Section 4 covers the comprehensive comparison simulations. Section 5 demonstrates the experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control. Section 6 draws the conclusion.

Mathematical model of PMSM and analysis of system uncertainty
The FOC-based PMSM model can be expressed as follows:

⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢𝐼˙𝑑𝐼˙𝑞𝜔˙𝑒⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥=⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢−𝑅𝑠𝐿−𝜔𝑒0𝜔𝑒−𝑅𝑠𝐿32𝑝2𝐽𝜓𝑟0−1𝐿𝜓𝑟0⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢𝐼𝑑𝐼𝑞𝜔𝑒⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥+⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢1𝐿0001𝐿000−𝑝𝐽⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢𝑈𝑑𝑈𝑞𝑇𝐿⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥
(1)
where 𝜔𝑒 is the electrical rotor speed, 𝐼𝑑 and 𝐼𝑞 are the stator currents in d-q frame or d-q axis, 𝑈𝑑 and 𝑈𝑞 are the stator voltages in d-q frame, 𝑇𝐿 is the external payload, 𝑅𝑠 is the stator resistance, L is the stator inductance in d-q frame, 𝜓𝑟 is the magnetic flux linkage, J is the moment of inertial and p is the number of pole pairs.

According to [11], the uncertainty in PMSM contains the cogging torque 𝑑cogT(N.M), the torque 𝑑fluxT(N.M) caused by flux harmonics, dead-time effects 𝑑deaddv(V) and 𝑑deadqv(V), measurement errors 𝑑offsetdc(A) and 𝑑offsetqc(A), the payload torque 𝑑payloadT(N.M), the torsional vibration 𝑑eccentricT(N.M) caused by misalignment of shaft, the torque 𝑑inertiaT(N.M) caused by the inertia uncertainty and the friction 𝑑fricT(N.M). Uncertainties are then added to Eq. (1),

⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢I˙dI˙q𝜔˙e⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥=⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢−𝑅𝑠𝐿−𝜔𝑒0𝜔𝑒−𝑅𝑠𝐿32𝑝2𝐽𝜓𝑟0−1𝐿𝜓𝑟0⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢𝐼𝑑𝐼𝑞𝜔𝑒⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥+⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢1𝐿0001𝐿0000⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢𝑈𝑑𝑈𝑞𝑇𝐿⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥+ΔΔ𝐝

(3)
𝑇𝐿≜𝑑payload𝑇(𝑁⋅𝑀)Δ𝑇𝐿=dfricT(N.M)+deccentricT(N.M)+

dinertiaT(N.M)+dcogT(N.M)+dfluxT(N.M), ΔUd≜ddeaddv(V), ΔUq≜ddeadqv(V), ΔJ is the inertia uncertainty, ΔRs, ΔL and Δψr are variations of the stator resistance, the stator inductance and the flux linkage of PMSM, respectively.

In fact, the inertia uncertainty effects the mechanical equation of PMSM:

(𝐽+Δ𝐽)𝜔˙𝑒=32𝑝2𝜓𝑟𝐼𝑞
(4)
𝐽𝜔˙𝑒=32𝑝2𝜓𝑟𝐼𝑞−𝑑inertia𝑇(𝑁⋅𝑚)
(5)
where

𝑑inertia𝑇(𝑁⋅𝑚)=Δ𝐽𝜔˙𝑒
(6)
Remark 1
According to Eq. (3), Δd3 is affected by TL, ΔTL and parameter uncertainties ΔJ and Δψr. Therefore, Δd3 can be simplified to−pJ(TL+ΔTL), if ΔJ and Δψr are small enough to be neglected.

Remark 2
According to Eq. (3), Δd1 and Δd2 are affected by the parameter uncertainties ΔRs, Δψr, ΔL and dead-time effects ΔUd, ΔUq. Then, Δd1=Δd2=0, if these uncertainties are small enough.

Remark 3
Note that model parameters are affected by the environmental temperature. Since the environmental temperature is a gradual changing variable, the parameter uncertainties in Δd1, Δd2 and Δd3 can be then regarded as a piecewise function of a vector (Id. Iq, ωe, Ud, Uq, TL, ΔTL) according to Eq. (3). Moreover, according to Eq. (3), the parameter uncertainties in Δd2 and Δd3 are related to Iq, which means that components Iq[−1L+ΔL(ψr+Δψr)+1Lψr] in Δd2 and 32Iq[p2(J+ΔJ)(ψr+Δψr)−p2Jψr] in Δd3 increase when the disturbances such as payloads and eccentric effects are added to the PMSM system. In addition, Δd3 is affected by the cogging torque, the torque caused by flux harmonics, the torque caused by eccentric effects, which are sinusoidal functions of ∫ωe, the friction torque, which is a nonlinear function of ωe, and the inertia uncertainty, which is a linear or a piecewise linear function of ω˙e.

Note that the speed performance is imperative in PMSM servo systems. Therefore, the ELM is designed for the speed loop to eliminate the uncertainty effects and achieve a superb performance.

Design of the proposed ELMFOFLC
This section presents the proposed ELMFOFLC as shown in Fig. 1, in which FOFLC1 and FOFLC2 are the controllers of inner loops to generate input voltages Ud and Uq, respectively, and FOFLC3 is the speed loop controller to generate the current reference of q-axis. In addition, the frame transformation and the space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) are used for applying the FOC [27]. The encoder measures the electrical angle of PMSM. Design details of each control block are given in the following subsections.

Design of the FOFLC
Define ω∗e, I∗d and I∗q as the references of the speed loop, the Id loop and the Iq loop, respectively.

Before presenting the proposed ELMFOFLC, the following assumptions are first addressed:

Assumption 1 (A1): ωe,Id,Iq are available [28].

Assumption 2 (A2): ΔΔ𝐝 is unknown but bounded and ‖ΔΔ𝐝‖<𝑀, where M is a positive constant [12].

Assumption 3 (A3): ω∗e is a first-order differentiable function besides ω˙∗e being finite [29].

Assumption 4 (A4): the power source is capable to provide abundant power for control variables Ud,Uq to track ω∗e and reject Δd.

Assumption5 (A5): the timescale separation principle is available for the speed loop and the Iq loop [30,31,32,33, 37].

Remark 4
The following considerations should be given:

(1)
A1 is made to calculate and compensate for the nonlinear components of PMSM in closed loops.

(2)
ΔΔ𝐝 is a lumped uncertainty vector which is also related to control inputs and system states [12]. However, signals in real systems are limited by the hardware; therefore, ΔΔ𝐝 has an upper bound as assumed in A2.

(3)
A3 is required to guarantee the system performance and stability [29].

(4)
As the practical hardware limits signals in the PMSM system including ωe, Id and Iq, it is essential to choose a suitable power source for the designed controllers to meet the required performance as assumed in A4.

(5)
A5 is a common assumption for PMSM systems with the cascaded structure, in which the dynamic of the Iq loop can be neglected for the speed loop [30,31,32,33, 37]. In fact, the mechanical time constant in the speed control loop is much larger than the electrical time constant in the current loop [32, 33]. Moreover, control parameters in the Iq loop and the speed loop can be chosen to make the bandwidth of the Iq loop much higher than that of the speed loop according to the bandwidth parameterization [34]. Therefore, Iq=I∗q is utilized when we prove the stability of the speed loop.

Based on the feedback linearization technique, we propose the following controllers for the PMSM system:

⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪𝑈𝑑=−𝑈𝑛𝑑+𝑈𝑐𝑑𝑈𝑞=−𝑈𝑛𝑞+𝑈𝑐𝑞𝑈𝜔=−𝑈𝑛𝜔+𝑈𝑐𝜔
(7)
where Ud, Uq and Uω are control inputs of the Id loop, the Iq loop and the speed loop, respectively; Und, Unq and Un𝜔 are the model nonlinear components in the Id loop, the Iq loop and the speed loop or the ωe loop, respectively;Ucd, Ucq and Uc𝜔 are control components for the Id loop, the Iq loop and the ωe loop, respectively; moreover, UDO is the lumped uncertainty estimated by ELM. As shown in Fig. 1, the output of speed loop Uω is also the reference of Iq loop, i.e., I∗q. Namely, Uω=I∗q.

According to Eq. (1), Und, Unq and Un𝜔 are chosen as follows:

⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪𝑈𝑛𝑑=𝐿(𝜔𝑒𝐼𝑞−𝑅𝑠𝐿𝐼𝑑)𝑈𝑛𝑞=𝐿(−𝜔𝑒𝐼𝑑−𝑅𝑠𝐿𝐼𝑞−𝜓𝑟𝐿𝜔𝑒)𝑈𝑛𝜔=0
(8)
The state feedback control with an integral component to reduce the static error [1] is generally used in practice which is also employed in current loops in this paper as follows:

⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪𝑈𝑐𝑑=𝐿(−𝐾𝑝3𝑒𝑑−𝐾𝑖3∫𝑒𝑑)𝑈𝑐𝑞=𝐿(𝐼˙∗𝑞−𝐾𝑝2𝑒𝑞−𝐾𝑖2∫𝑒𝑞)𝑈𝑐𝜔=23𝐽𝑝2𝜓𝑟(𝜔˙∗𝑒−𝐾𝑝1𝑒𝜔−𝑈𝐷𝑂)
(9)
where eω=ωe−ω∗e, eq=Iq−I∗q and ed=Id−I∗d. Kp1, Kp2, Ki2, Kp3 and Ki3 are all positive constants.

Design of the extreme learning machine
The ELM is developed from SLFNs by Huang et al. [21]. SLFNs contain three layers, namely the input layer, the hidden layer and the output layer [18, 21, 25].

For N input–output samples (𝐱j,𝐭j), where 𝐱j=[xj1,xj2,…,xjn]T∈𝐑n×1 and 𝐭j=[tj1,tj2,…,tjm]T∈𝐑m×1 and j = 1,…,N, SLFNs are used to establish a relationship between the input nodes 𝐱j and the output nodes 𝐨j∈𝐑m×1 with Ñ hidden nodes, the activation function g(x), hidden node parameters 𝐰iε𝐑n×1 and bi𝜖R, and output weights ββiε𝐑m×1 (i = 1,…, Ñ) through the following mathematical model:

∑i=1Ñ ββig(𝐰𝐓𝐢𝐱j+bi)=𝐨j
(10)
where 𝐰i is for connecting the ith hidden node and the input nodes, bi is the threshold of the ith hidden node and ββi is for connecting the ith hidden node and the output nodes. The aim of SLFNs is to make 𝐨j equal to 𝐭j after the neural network learning process:

∑i=1Ñ ββig(𝐰𝐓𝐢𝐱j+bi)=𝐭j
(11)
Considering j = 1,…,N and i = 1,…,𝑁̃ , we can rewrite Eq. (11) as follows:

𝐇𝛽=𝐓
(12)
where 𝐇=⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢g(𝐰𝐓1𝐱1+b1)⋮g(𝐰𝐓1𝐱N+b1)⋯……g(𝐰𝐓𝑁̃ 𝐱1+𝑟b𝑁̃ )⋮g(𝐰𝑁̃ 𝑟𝐓𝐱N+b𝑁̃ )⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥N×N∼,

ββ=⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢ββ𝐓1⋮ββ𝐓N∼⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥N∼×m and 𝐓=⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢𝐭𝐓1⋮𝐭𝐓N⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥N×m.

According to Theorem 2.1 and Theorem 2.2 in [21], with activation functions which are infinitely differentiable, such as sigmoidal functions, the radial basis, etc., we have ‖𝐇ββ−𝐓‖=0 if the number of hidden nodes is abundant, otherwise ‖𝐇ββ−𝐓‖≤ε, where ε is a small positive value.

Moreover, Huang et al. have proved that if activation functions are infinitely differentiable, then the hidden parameters of SLFNs can be randomly assigned. The ELM is then developed based on this kind of SLFNs.

Note that conventional learning methods for neural networks like the back-propagation (BP) learning method have some limitations such as time-consuming and local minima instead of global minima. [21]. Then, the fast learning method is proposed: If 𝑁̃ = N, then the matrix H is square and invertible [21], and ββ=𝐇−1𝐓 is achieved. However, if 𝑁̃ ≪N, then the matrix H is nonsquare. In this case, the new output weights ββ are designed based on the smallest norm least squares solution as follows:

𝛽̂ =𝐇+𝐓
(13)
where 𝐇+ is the Moore–Penrose generalized inverse of matrix 𝐇.

Remark 5
Note that although the above ELM-SLFN is effective in areas like the pattern classification, it cannot be used directly in the closed-loop motion control to estimate the uncertainty [18, 25] because the lumped uncertainty we need to estimate is generally unknown. In this case, ββˆ=𝐇+𝐓 is not available since T referring to the real lumped uncertainty is unknown, while the input–output samples are generally given as a prior knowledge in pattern classifications. Due to these facts, the output weight ββˆ is online-updated by an adaptive law which is inspired by [18, 25], although the ELM designed in this paper has the same structure in the pattern classification.

Remark 6
The designed ELM has the following merits in the closed-loop control: The upper bound of the lumped uncertainty is significantly reduced since ELM can estimate and compensate for a wide range of uncertainties. In addition, the proposed ELM-based control not only improves the speed tracking performance but also can be implemented in real time.

Before designing the ELM for the PMSM system, we analyze the relationship between Δd3 and FOFLC. From

Equation (2):

𝜔˙e=32p2JψrIq+Δd3
(14)
As Iq=I∗q+eq, Eq. (14) can be transformed into:

𝜔˙e=32p2JψrI∗q+32p2Jψreq+Δd3
(15)
e˙ω=𝜔˙e−𝜔˙∗e=−Kp1eω−UDO+32p2Jψreq+Δd3
(16)
Set UDO=0, and the relationship between Δd3 and FOFLC is:

Δd3=e˙ω+Kp1eω−32p2Jψreq
(17)
where Δd3 is related to eω, e˙ω and eq. Therefore, we design an ELM as shown in Fig. 2, in which input layer nodes are selected as eω, e˙ω, eq according to Eq. (17), and the output node is the estimation of Δd3, namely Δˆd3.

Fig. 2

Choose the sigmoid function as ELM’s activation function:

Hi=11+e−(𝐰𝐢.𝐄+bi)(i=1,2,…,Ñ )
(18)
where 𝐄=[eω,e˙ω,eq]T,𝐰𝐢=[wi1,wi2,wi3] and bi are able to be randomly designed according to [21].

Δd3 is able to be expressed with the sum of product terms according to [18, 25].

Δd3=∑i=1Ñ Hiβ∗i=ββ∗T𝐇
(19)
where ββ∗=[β∗1,β∗2,β∗3,…,β∗𝑁̃ ]T is the ideal constant output weights vector for the real lumped uncertainty.

Δˆd3 is expressed as

⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪UDO=Δ̂ d3=∑i=1N˜Hiβiˆ=𝛽ˆT𝐇Δ̂ d3=Δd3+𝜀
(20)
where 𝜀 denotes the bounded approximation error, 𝐇=[H1,H2,H3,…,H𝑁̃ ]T, and ββˆ=[βˆ1,βˆ2,βˆ3,…,βˆ𝑁̃ ]T is the estimated output weight vector, which can be tuned automatically by the following adaptive learning algorithm:

ββˆ=𝜂𝑒𝜔𝐇
(21)
where η is a positive adaptive gain.

Stability analysis
To prove the stability of the proposed control system, Lemma 1 is given first and the proof of Lemma 1 is given in the Appendix.

Lemma 1
For the PMSM system with assumptions (A1–A4), the current tracking errors ed and eq in current loops will converge to and confine within

{|𝑒𝑑|≤𝑀𝐾𝑝3∣∣𝑒𝑞∣∣≤𝑀𝐾𝑝2
(22)
The control inputs are constructed as follows:

{𝑈𝑑=−𝐿(𝜔𝑒𝐼𝑞−𝑅𝑠𝐿𝐼𝑑)+𝐿(−𝐾𝑝3𝑒𝑑−𝐾𝑖3∫𝑒𝑑)𝑈𝑞=−𝐿(−𝜔𝑒𝐼𝑑−𝑅𝑠𝐿𝐼𝑞−𝜓𝑟𝐿𝜔𝑒)+𝐿(𝐼˙∗𝑞−𝐾𝑝2𝑒𝑞−𝐾𝑖2∫𝑒𝑞)
(23)
Note that generally Kp2 and Kp3 are set sufficiently large so that the errors can be as close to zero as possible [37].

The stability of current loops is proved in Lemma 1. Here, we prove the stability of the speed loop.

Theorem 1
For the PMSM system with assumptions (A1–A5), the speed tracking error eω is asymptotically stable, if the control law is designed as:

I∗q=23Jp2ψr(𝜔˙∗e−Kp1eω−𝛽̂ T𝐇)
(24)
with {𝑈𝑑=−𝐿(𝜔𝑒𝐼𝑞−𝑅𝑠𝐿𝐼𝑑)+𝐿(−𝐾𝑝3𝑒𝑑−𝐾𝑖3∫𝑒𝑑) 𝑈𝑞=−𝐿(−𝜔𝑒𝐼𝑑−𝑅𝑠𝐿𝐼𝑞−𝜓𝑟𝐿𝜔𝑒)+𝐿(𝐼˙∗𝑞−𝐾𝑝2𝑒𝑞−𝐾𝑖2∫𝑒𝑞)

Proof
According to Eq. (2) and A3:

𝑒˙𝜔=𝜔˙𝑒−𝜔˙∗𝑒=−32𝑝2𝐽𝜓𝑟𝐼𝑞+Δ𝑑3−𝜔˙∗𝑒
(25)
According to A5 and Lemma 1, Eq. (25) can be transformed to:

𝑒˙𝜔=−3/2𝑝2/𝐽𝜓𝑟𝐼∗𝑞+Δ𝑑3−𝜔˙∗𝑒
(26)
Substitute Eq. (20) and Eq. (24) into Eq. (26),

𝑒˙𝜔= 32𝑝2𝐽𝜓𝑟[23𝐽𝑝2𝜓𝑟(𝜔˙∗𝑒−Δ̂ 𝑑3−𝐾𝑝1𝑒𝜔)]+Δ𝑑3−𝜔˙∗𝑒=(Δ𝑑3−Δ̂ 𝑑3)−𝐾𝑝1𝑒𝜔
(27)
According to Eq. (19):

𝛽˙∗=0
(28)
Define eβˆ=βˆ−β∗, and according to Eq. (28):

𝑒˙𝛽̂ =𝛽̂ ˙
(29)
Substitute Eq. (21) into Eq. (29):

e˙𝛽̂ =𝜂𝑒ω𝐇
(30)
Choose a Lyapunov function as follows:

𝑉=12𝑒2𝜔+12𝜂𝑒2𝛽̂ 
(31)
Then, the time derivative of Eq. (31) is:

𝑉˙=𝑒𝜔𝑒˙𝜔+1𝜂𝑒𝑇𝛽̂ 𝑒˙𝛽̂ 
(32)
Substitute Eqs. (27) and (30) into Eq. (32):

𝑉˙=𝑒𝜔[(Δ𝑑3−Δ̂ 𝑑3)−𝐾𝑝1𝑒𝜔]+(𝛽̂ −𝛽∗)𝑇𝑒𝜔𝐻
(33)
Substitute Eqs. (19, 20) into Eq. (33):

V˙=eω(−Kp1eω)+eω(Δd3−Δ̂ d3)+eω[Δ̂ d3−Δd3]
(34)
Simplify Eq. (34):

𝑉˙=−𝐾𝑝1𝑒2𝜔
(35)
Therefore, if Kp1>0,

V˙≤0
(36)
Note that V˙=0, if and only if eω=0, else V˙<0. Invoking the LaSalle principle, Corollary 4.1 in [35], the speed loop is asymptotical stable and this completes the proof.

Comparative simulation study
In this section, the proposed ELMFOFLC is simulated and compared with the FOFLC and PI systems under various uncertainties. The PMSM is modeled according to Eq. (1) [1, 26] with nominal parameters shown in Table 1.

Table 1 Nominal model parameters of PMSM
Full size table
Remark 5
The proposed control contains parameters Kp1, Kp2, Kp3, Ki2, Ki3, η and the number of hidden nodes 𝑁̃  in the ELM. The following considerations are given for tuning the parameters:

(1)
As the FOFLC is applied to PMSM, the mathematical model of PMSM is linearized, and Kp2, Kp3, Ki2 and Ki3 can be optimized by making the bandwidth of current loops large enough based on the bandwidth parameterization [34]. This method makes the bandwidth of the Iq loop a function of Kp2 and Ki2, and the bandwidth of the Id loop a function of Kp3 and Ki3. Generally speaking, the larger the bandwidth, the faster the dynamic response of the system. However, an overwhelming bandwidth will enlarge sensor noise and cause the saturation of actuators.

(2)
Kp1(is selected larger than zero but keeping the bandwidth of the speed loop smaller than that of the Iq loop to satisfy A5.

(3)
The more the hidden nodes 𝑁̃  are used, the less the ELM estimation error. However, the computation burden in the real-time control system increases as well. 𝑁̃  is first selected as a number larger than that of input nodes and output nodes, and then 𝑁̃  should increase until estimation errors and the computation requirement are satisfied.

(4)
𝐰𝐢 (and 𝐛𝐢 are chosen according to an even distribution [18, 21, 25].

(5)
The adaptive gain η is selected considering the tracking rate and the robustness of the closed-loop system [18], since the larger the η, the faster the tracking, while an overwhelming large value causes the closed-loop instability.

A.
Tracking with external disturbances

In this simulation, the speed reference is 1000 r/min [36]. The simulation step is 0.000001 s, and the frequency of pulse width module (PWM) is 10 K Hz. The external disturbances are assumed as follows [11]:

⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪𝑑fric𝑇(𝑁.𝑚)=𝑒−(0.01∗𝜔𝑒𝑝)2sign(𝜔𝑒)+0.05∗𝜔𝑒𝑝𝑑inertia𝑇(𝑁.𝑚)=0.0005∗𝜔˙𝑒𝑑eccentric𝑇(𝑁.𝑚)=0.5∗sin(2∗𝜋∗10𝑡)+0.5𝑑payload𝑇(𝑁.𝑚)=⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪0  (𝑡<0.8𝑠)2(0.8𝑠≤𝑡<1.2𝑠)0(𝑡≥1.2𝑠)
(37)
The control parameters of ELMFOFLC are adjusted according to rules mentioned in Remark 5, while the control parameters of FOFLC and PI are tuned so that both systems have similar maximums of control inputs under saturation limits of the actuator.

The proposed system is designed with Kp1=1200; Kp2=20000, Ki2=120000; Kp3=20000, Ki3=120000. The wi1, wi2, wi3 and bi are chosen evenly and randomly within the intervals [− 0.00016, 0.00016], [ 0.008, 0.008], [ 0.016, 0.016] and [0, 10], respectively. The number of ELM inputs is 3, the number of hidden layers N∼ is 10, and the adaptive gain η=800. The FOFLC system is tuned with Kp1=1200, Ki1=3600; Kp2=20000,Ki2=120000; Kp3=20000, Ki3=120000. The PI system is tuned with Kp1=3,Ki1=80; Kp2=200, Ki2=1200; Kp3=200, Ki3=1200.

Figure 3 shows the simulated tracking performance of different algorithms with external disturbances, and Table 2 presents the quantitative tracking indices, including overshoot (OS), root-mean-square steady-state error (RMSE), recover time (RT) after the payload is applied and maximum (MAX) values of the tracking error [38]. The RMSE of the proposed system is significantly smaller than the other two controls in Table 2, while the speed of the proposed control is the closest to the reference shown in Fig. 3. According to Fig. 3 and Table 2, the Max and OS of the proposed system are also the smallest among three control systems. Moreover, RT of the proposed system is the shortest in Table 2, while the dynamic of the proposed system is the fastest among three systems in Fig. 3.

Figure 4 illustrates the control inputs of the proposed control, which are not saturated. Figure 5 indicates that the actual lumped external disturbance shown in Eq. (37) is estimated by the ELM with little error. Figure 6a shows the current 𝐼𝑞 of the proposed system, in which there are some fluctuations. This is because 𝐼𝑞 is related to the electrical torque of PMSM which compensates for the external disturbances to improve the speed performance. Figure 6b presents three-phase currents of PMSM, which are sine waves with a 2π3 phase difference from each other.

Tracking with external disturbances and parameter uncertainties

In this section, we conduct comparative simulations with external disturbances and model parameter uncertainties.

The external disturbances are same as Eq. (37). In addition, parameter uncertainties are added to the nominal parameters shown in Table 3. The control parameters are same as ones designed in Part A.

Figure 7 shows the simulated speed tracking performances with external disturbances and parameter uncertainties, while their quantitative tracking indices are summarized in Table 4. There is less overshoot and faster converging rate of the proposed control than the FOFLC and PI control shown in Fig. 7, and correspondingly the Max and OS of the proposed system are the smallest in Table 4. Moreover, the proposed control has smaller speed fluctuations and is more accurate than its counterparts in Fig. 7, while the RMSE of the proposed system is the smallest in Table 4. According to Fig. 7 and Table 4, the proposed control has the best tracking performance among three control systems under the parameter uncertainties and the external disturbances. Figure 8 presents the ELM estimation in the solid line, which is larger than the actual lumped external disturbance in the dotted line. This is because the ELM estimation contains not only the lumped external disturbance but also the parameter uncertainties. This difference increases when a payload is added at 0.8 s. The extra payload increases the parameter uncertainties as analyzed in Remark 3. Figure 9 illustrates that the control inputs Ud and Uq of the proposed system are not over the saturation. However, the control inputs increase in Fig. 9 compared with Fig. 4, because the system has extra parameter uncertainties in addition to disturbances.

Figure 10a illustrates the current Iq of the proposed control, and Fig. 10b shows the phase currents Ia, Ib and Ic of the proposed control, in which the magnitudes are larger than that in Fig. 6a and 6b, respectively, because of the additional parameter uncertainties.

Experimental validation
In this section, we conduct the experimental validation of the proposed control with the external payload, the eccentric disturbance and parameter uncertainties.

The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 11 which consists of a PMSM, a DSP control board, a driving board, a programmable DC voltage source, an oscilloscope, a payload motor and a PC. Figure 12 shows the block diagram of the experimental setup. The PMSM 60ASM100 is manufactured by Shenzhen Just Motion Control Electromechanics. The digital signal processing (DSP) (Texas Instruments C2000 F28335)-based control board is employed to perform control algorithms in real time. The control signals are transmitted to a driving board IR2136, which drives an inverter bridge including six CMD482 MOSFETs. The PMSM is then fed by the inverter bridge. The current sensors and position encoders provide signal measurements for the DSP to implement the control algorithms. The programmable DC supply is used to supply energy for the whole system. The oscilloscope is utilized to record the system data. A BLDC is connected to the PMSM as a generator. Therefore, the payload can be added from the BLDC with a rectifier when a resistance is connected to the output.

An unknown payload which is proportional to the speed of PMSM is added to the system after the speed reaches the reference. Note that model parameter uncertainties and the eccentric disturbance exist in the system all the time. As the proposed algorithm is designed in the continuous-time domain and the DSP operates in the discrete-time domain, DSP needs to operate at a high frequency so that the difference between the continuous-time domain and discrete-time domain can be neglected. Theoretically, the higher the frequency of DSP, the better the performance of the proposed algorithm. However, a too high frequency increases the computation burden of DSP. On the contrary, a too low frequency decreases the good performance of the proposed algorithm and even causes the system instability. Considering these factors, we select the interval operation time of DSP F28335 as 0.0001 s.

The nominal electrical and mechanical parameters of the PMSM are measured manually as shown in Table 5. The model parameter uncertainties unavoidably exist in the real system.

Tracking of a 600r/min reference

A 600 r/min speed reference [36] is employed to test the proposed algorithm first. The proposed control system is established with Kp1=200 (speed loop); Kp2=3000, Ki2=30000(Iq loop); Kp3=3000, Ki3=30000 (Id loop). The number of ELM inputs is 3, and the number of hidden layers 𝑁̃  is 10. The FOFLC is established with Kp1=200, Ki1=300 (speed loop); Kp2=3000, Ki2=30000 (Iq loop); Kp3=3000, Ki3=30000 (Id loop). The PI is established with Kp1=0.0146, Ki1=0.022 (speed loop); Kp2=3.67, Ki2=36.657 (Iqloop); Kp3=3.67, Ki3=36.657 (Idloop).

Figure 13 shows the experimental speed tracking comparison of three control methods at the reference 600r/min, and the corresponding quantitative comparisons are shown in Table 6. According to Table 6, the proposed system has the smallest MAX, RT and RMSE and the tracking performance of the proposed system is better than the counterparts shown in Fig. 13. Figure 14 illustrates the proposed control inputs Ud and Uq, which are under hardware limits. Figure 15 presents the ELM estimation of the system lumped uncertainty. Figure 16a shows the Iq response in the proposed system, and Fig. 16b demonstrates the phase currents 𝐼𝑎 and 𝐼𝑏, which are sine waves with a 2π3 phase difference. The fast Fourier transformation (FFT) is utilized to analyze the speed fluctuation in different systems at static state. Due to the eccentric effect, the 10 Hz harmonic is outstanding to other harmonics shown in Fig. 17. This is also confirmed in Table 6, in which the 10 Hz harmonic (M10) of three systems, M10 in the proposed system, decreases by 80% more than its counterparts.

Tracking of a 1000 r/min reference

In this section, a 1000 r/min speed reference [36] is employed to further validate the proposed algorithm, especially considering the eccentric effect at high speed.

Figure 18 shows the experimental speed responses of three systems at the speed reference 1000 r/min, and the corresponding quantitative tracking indices are summarized in Table 7. The proposed system has significantly smaller RMSE, MAX and OS than the others as shown in Table 7. Figure 18 presents that the proposed system in black color tracks the reference with the smallest steady-state error, and its RT is the shortest after the payload is applied at about 3.6 s. Figure 19 illustrates that the control of the proposed algorithm is under hardware limits. Figure 20 presents the ELM estimation of the lumped system uncertainty. Compared with Fig. 15, the lumped system uncertainty increases because the payload disturbance is proportional to the motor speed. Figure 21a and b shows the 𝐼𝑞, 𝐼𝑎 and 𝐼𝑏 responses in the proposed system, respectively. Similarly, the magnitudes of Iq and the phase currents also increase in Fig. 21 compared with Fig. 16. Since the eccentric effect is also related to the speed, the 16.5 Hz speed harmonic is then outstanding to other speed harmonics in this case. Figure 22 presents the speed FFT analysis of three systems, and the magnitude of 16.5 Hz speed harmonic (M16.5) of three systems is given in Table 7, in which M16.5 decreases 74% more in the proposed system.

Conclusions
In this paper, an ELMFOFLC is proposed to improve the robustness and tracking accuracy for a PMSM system. A field-oriented control with the cascaded structure is used to design FOFLCs for a PMSM system. As model parameter uncertainties and external disturbances exist in PMSM control systems, an ELM is then designed to estimate and compensate for the lumped uncertainty in the speed loop after analyzing the property of various uncertainties in the FOFLC-based PMSM system. The comprehensive simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed control has a superior tracking performance under various uncertainties. Future works will further improve the performance of the ELM-based control systems in terms of the robustness, tracking accuracy and transient response.
