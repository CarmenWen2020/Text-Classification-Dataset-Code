Roller burnishing is an alternative approach to enhance surface properties under plastic deformation and most investigations focused on optimizing process parameters. However, the impacts of operating parameters of the minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) system on the surface properties have not been considered. The roller burnishing process is widely applied to fabricate high-pressure bushings and crankshafts with superior quality, while the MQL system is extensively employed to facilitate different machining operations for saving lubricant usage, decreasing negative impacts on the environment, and protecting worker’s health. The purpose of this investigation is to select the optimal  MQL system factors, including the nozzle diameter (D), impingement angle (I), flow rate (Q), and air pressure (P) for decreasing the maximum profile peak height of the roughness (MAR) and improving Vickers hardness (VH) for the roller burnishing process. The optimal artificial neural network (ANN) model was proposed to render the relations between the optimizing inputs and burnishing responses. An efficiently evolutionary technique entitled multi-objective glowworm swarm optimization (MOGSO) was utilized to produce a set of feasible solutions. The VIKOR method was employed to determine the best optimal solution. The results revealed that the 4–10–2 architecture of the developed ANN models efficiently described the burnishing performances and precisely predicted the response values. The optimal outcomes of the D, I, Q, and P were 1.5 mm, 45 deg., 130 ml/h, and 0.6 MPa, while the improvements in the MAR and VH were 17.0% and 14.0%, respectively, as compared to the common values used. The proposed approach comprising the ANN, MOGSO, and VIKOR could be considered as a powerful technique to deal with the complicated optimizing issue for the roller burnishing operation. The obtained finding could be expected as a significant contribution to enhancement in the machining quality for the roller burnishing process under the MQL condition.

Introduction
The roller burnishing process is one of the efficient finishing operations, which is widely applied to yield excellent surface characteristics and enhance the productivity, as compared to the ball one. This operation induced by plastic deformation provides several benefits to improve the roughness indicators, hardness criteria, residual compress stress, fatigue strength, and corrosion resistance. The roller burnishing technology can be performed on both conventional and computer numerical control machines. This process only requires replacing burnishing tools to manufacture different surface shapes, instead of a large number of devices required, including machines, fixtures, tools, and auxiliary equipment; hence, the roller burnishing process can be extensively applied to small-batch and mass productions. Therefore, industrial applications of the roller burnishing process have been become more effective and efficient, as compared to conventional finishing operations, such as grinding, lapping, and honing processes.

Many investigators have been attempted to enhance the technical performances of different roller burnishing processes. The surface characteristics, including the roughness criteria, hardness indicators, the depth of the affected layer, wear rate, and coefficient of friction, have been considered and optimized. The surface roughness (Rs) model was proposed regarding the spindle speed (Vb), interference (I), feed rate (fr), and the number of passes (Np) for the burnished aluminum alloy with the aid of the response surface methodology (RSM) [1]. The authors stated that the I and f had the highest contributions. Similarly, the empirical models of the surface hardness (Hs) and Rs for the burnished alloy regarding the burnishing force (fb), contact width (CW), fr, and Np were developed by John et al. [2]. The results  the Rs was decreased by 94.8%, while the Hs was improved by 41.6%. The Rs and micro-hardness (Hm) of the machined TA2 alloy were enhanced by 63.0% and 28.0%, respectively, as compared to the pre-burnished characteristics  [3].  In addition, the surface properties of the burnished TA2 alloy could be improved with the support of the low plasticity burnishing process, in which the Hm was enhanced by 35.8% [4]. The RSM models of the Rs, dimension (Sb), and ovality (OV) for the machined cast iron regarding the Vb, fr, and penetration allowances (PA) were developed for the internal burnishing process [5]. A new burnishing approach, namely the toroidal roller burnishing, was developed by Dunchave et al. [6], in which the  authors stated that the fatigue limit of the burnished alloy was increased by 38.4%, as compared to the traditional one. Furthermore, this method could be effectively applied to enhance the compressive axial and hoop stresses [7]. Shankar et al. emphasized that the enhancements in the Rs and Hs of the burnished metal matrix composite could be obtained with an increment in the Np [8]. The authors stated that the enhancements in the burnishing objectives could be obtained using higher burnishing passes and uncoated rollers. Banh and Shiou indicated that the enhancements in the Rs and Hs were 91.0% and 8.0%, respectively, for the burnished mold material at the fb of 10 N, the step over (SO) of 4 µm, the Vb of 500 mm/min, and the Np of 3 [9]. The RSM models of the Rs and Hs were developed for the ultrasonic-assisted ball burnishing (UABB) process regarding the vibration amplitude (VA), static force (SF), and fr [10]. The authors stated that the VA of 8 µm, SF of 38 N, and fr of 1000 mm/min could be selected to enhance the burnishing responses. The impacts of different burnishing strategies on the Rs of the burnished 2017A-T451 aluminum alloy were analyzed by Amdouni et al. [11]. The authors stated that perpendicular passes could help to improve surface integrity. Vukelic et al. [12] emphasized that the ball burnishing operation could effectively be applied to enhance the barrier properties in all kinds of wood. The optimum Rs of 0.336 μm and Hm of 102.7 HV for the burnished AZ91D alloy were selected with the aid of the Taguchi method, while optimizing parameters were Vb, fb, Np, and fr, respectively [13].

The RSM was applied in conjunction with the AMGA to select the optimal process parameters for improving the Rs, Hs, and the depth of affected layer (AL) of the internal burnishing operation of the carbon steel, in which the Hs and AL were enhanced by 25.0% and 37%, respectively [14]. Similarly, the Rs and Hs were improved by 92.0% and 46.0% by means of optimal burnishing parameters [15]. The impacts of process parameters (fb, fr, and Np) and different cooling conditions (dry, wet, boron oil, and mineral oil) on the Rs of the burnished carbon fiber-reinforced polymer were explored [16]. The authors stated that the best Rs was obtained at the fb of 250 N, fr of 0.05 mm/rev., Np of 4, and wet medium, respectively. The Jerez-Mesa et al. stated that the highest improvements of the Rs and Hs for the VABB process could be obtained at the fb of 300 N and Np of 5 [17]. A 100 nm thickness of the affected layer and higher compressive stress could be obtained with the aid of the VABB [18]. The desirability approach was utilized to decrease the Rs as well as the roundness (RN) and improve the Hs for the external burnishing process of the Mg–SiC metal matrix, while the Vb, fr, fb, and Np were optimizing inputs [19]. Ravankar et al. [20] emphasized that the specific wear rate (SWR) and coefficient of friction (COF) were decreased by 52.0% and 64.0% at the optimality, respectively, as compared to the turned surface for the ball burnished titanium alloy. The wear resistance of the processed AISI 316L could be enhanced by 54.0% with the aid of the burnishing process [21]. Pohrelyuk et al. [22] presented that increasing the number of passes and/or applying small loads enhances the wear resistance of the nitrided VT22 alloy. The ball burnishing process was employed in conjunction with the quenching and tempering operations to improve the Hs and the rupture strength (RS) [23]. The authors stated that the improvements in the Hs and RS were 30.5% and 31.0%, respectively, at the optimal conditions.

Recently, the energy criteria, noise emission, and production costs have been considered and optimized for various burnishing operations to cope with environmental legislation. The Taguchi method was applied to minimize the energy consumption (EC) as well as Rs and improve the power factor (PF) as well as Hs of the flat roller burnishing operation [24]. The authors stated that the EC and Rs were reduced by 31.5% and 7.4%, while the PF and Hs were improved by 17.5% and 43.1%, respectively. Nguyen et al. indicated that EC, Rs, and production costs (PC) were reduced by 39.50%, 7.83%, and 4.67%, respectively, while the Brinell hardness is improved by 29.61%, as compared to the initial values for the flat burnishing operation of H13 steel [25]. The Rs and the noise emission (MN) of the internal burnishing operation were decreased by 24.8% and 2.22%, respectively while the energy efficiency (EF) was improved by 6.97% with the aid of the adaptive neuro-based-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and non-dominated sorting particle swarm optimization (NOPSO)  [26]. The ANFIS was applied in conjunction with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) to decrease the burnishing energy (BE) and Rs [27]. The authors stated that the optimal values of the depth of penetration (DP), VA, fr, and SO are 0.07 mm, 15 µm, 1000 mm/min, and 0.12 mm, respectively. Similarly, the Rs and Rockwell hardness were enhanced by 24.26% and 3.96%, respectively, for the burnished alloy [28].

To cope with economic and environmental metrics, the minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) approach was developed and widely employed for different machining processes. For the MQL application, a small amount of lubricant is used in conjunction with compressed air to cool and lubricate the machining region. The MQL is a feasible, efficient, and eco-friendly alternative to conventional fluids, such as dry and conventional flood-cooling methods [29, 30]As a result, there are no disturbance. The applications of the MQL in various burnishing operations have been rarely considered [31]. Sachin et al. revealed that the Rs and Hs of the burnished stainless steel were significantly improved with the aid of the diamond burnishing operation [32]. Moreover, the Rs of the burnished titanium alloy was dramatically decreased using the optimal MQL system parameters  [33]. Similarly, Sachin et al. stated that the Rs and Hs were significantly enhanced with the support of the MQL approach [34].

It can be stated that many attempts of various burnishing operations have been performed to boost the machining responses.  The burnishing objectives considered are the environmental impacts (energy consumption, energy efficiency, noise emission, and power factor), machining quality (roughness, hardness, the depth of the affected layer, wear rate, and coefficient of friction), and production costs, while optimizing inputs were the process parameters (burnishing speed, depth of penetration, feed rate, number of rollers, step over, and roller width). Additionally, different optimizing techniques, including the ANFIS, Taguchi method, RSM, Kriging models, radius basis function, and desirability approach were employed to select the best optimal solution. However, the deficiencies of published works can be listed as follows:

The improvements in the technical performances of various burnishing operations under the flooding lubrication have been extensively explored. However, the machining responses for the internal burnishing operation under the minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) environment have not been considered and optimized. Particularly, two critical quality indicators of the minimum quantity lubrication-based internal roller burnishing process, including the surface roughness and hardness, have not been investigated.

Besides common process parameters (burnishing speed, feed rate, and depth of penetration), the operating parameters of the MQL system have to be considered as important parameters. The influences of MQL system factors, such as the nozzle diameter, impingement angle, flow rate, and air pressure on the burnishing quality, have not been explored in the aforementioned works. To enhance the applicability of the minimum quantity lubrication-based internal roller burnishing process, it is necessary to select optimal values of MQL system parameters to improve the surface roughness and hardness.

The aforementioned works primarily focused on optimizing process parameters to improve the quality indicators of the external surfaces in the minimum quantity lubrication-based burnishing operations. However, the improvements in the burnished internal surfaces under the minimum quantity lubrication have not been explored.

The conventional models, such as the RSM and polynomial approximations, do not sufficiently present the highly nonlinear data, while the desirability approach and Taguchi have a high risk to fall into the trap of local optimization. Furthermore, the application of the ANN approach in the modeling burnishing operation has been rarely considered. Therefore, it is necessary to propose an effective optimization approach to render the complicated data and determine the global optimization solution.

In the current investigation, the minimum quantity lubrication-based internal roller burnishing operation has been optimized to enhance Vickers hardness (VH) and decrease the maximum profile peak height of the roughness (MAR). The hardened steel, namely 50Cr, is selected as the experimental specimen due to wide applications for fabricating motor shafts and sliver bearings. The performance models are developed with the aid of the artificial neural network (ANN). The optimization outcomes are selected using the multi-objective glowworm swarm optimization (MOGSO) and VIKOR method.

Optimization approach
MQL system parameters and burnishing responses
In this investigation, two primary indicators of the burnishing quality, including the maximum profile peak height of the roughness (MAR) and Vickers hardness (VH), are addressed and optimized.

The maximum profile peak height of the roughness presents the point along the sampling length at which the curve is highest. The MAR value is computed as:

MAR=∑5𝑖=1𝑅𝑝𝑖5
(1)
where Rpi presents the maximum profile peak height at the ith measured location.

The VH value is calculated as:

VH=∑5𝑖=1VH𝑖5
(2)
where VHi denotes the Vickers hardness at the ith measured position.

The schematic illustration of the internal roller burnishing operation under the MQL condition is depicted in Fig. 1. For the internal roller burnishing operation, affecting factors are the process parameters (burnishing speed, feed rate, and depth of penetration), MQL system parameters (nozzle diameter, impingement angle, flow rate, and air pressure), tool design (roller profile, roller coating, tool configuration, and tool material), material characteristics (dimensions, composition, properties, and shapes), as shown in Fig. 2.

In this work, MQL system parameters, including the nozzle diameter, impingement angle, flow rate, and air pressure, are selected as optimizing inputs, as shown in Table 1. The ranges of each factor are determined based on the characteristics of the MQL system and the recommendations of the manufacturer.

Systematic approach
The systematic approach for the internal roller burnishing process is presented in Fig. 3, which includes the following steps:

Fig. 3

Optimization approach for the internal roller burnishing process

Step 1 The burnishing trials are conducted to obtain the necessary data. In this study, the type of design of experiment (DOE) entitled full factorial approach is utilized to produce the parameter combinations. The total number of experiments (N) of the full factorial approach is computed as:

𝑁=𝑛𝑘
(3)
where n and k present the number of levels and number of parameters considered, respectively. As a result, total experiments of 81 trials are produced for four MQL system parameters having three levels, which can be efficiently applied to develop the significant and adequate ANN model. Similar approaches to construct the ANN model using the full factorial approach can be found in the works of [34,35,36].

Practically, the ANN models can be developed using different DOE approaches, including the Taguchi method [37,38,39], Box–Behnken [40,41,42], and central composite [42,43,44] to solve various optimization issues. These proposed ANN models are significant and adequate although the number of experiments of these above methods is lower than the full factorial.

Step 2 The ANN models of the MAR and VH are proposed in terms of MQL operating parameters [45, 46].

ANN is an advanced computational modeling technique encouraged by the biological neural system and widely applied to resolve complex troubles, where traditional modeling approaches are inadequate [47, 48]. The output of each neuron is considered as a function of its inputs and weight, which is expressed as [49, 50]:

𝑈𝑗=∑input𝑖×𝑤𝑖𝑗
(4)
Output𝑗=𝐹𝑠(𝑈𝑗+𝑡𝑗)
(5)
where Uj, wij, ti, and Fs are the internal value, weight, threshold value, and transfer function, respectively. The output is an input for the next layer or response of neural network.

The working parameters of each ANN model include the training function, performance measure, active function, learning function, the number of hidden neurons, and the number of hidden layers. It is difficult to select the best architecture for the ANN model due to high number of affecting factors, excessive trials, huge time consumption, expensive cost, and unguided modeling.

The proposed approach for determining the best ANN model is presented in the left side of Fig. 2. An efficient DOE entiled the orthogonal array is applied to generate the combinations of ANN operating parameters. The computational trials of the developed ANN model are executed to compute the percentage deviation (PD), which is calculated as:

PD=(𝑎−𝑝𝑎)×100
(6)
where ‘a’ and ‘p’ present actual and predicted data, respectively.

The PD values less than 10% are utilized to select the optimal ANN model. In the case of equal PD values, the average errors of two burnishing objectives are considered.

Three evaluation indicators, including the R2 value, mean relative error (MRE), and root-mean-square error (RMSE), are used to check the model accuracy.

𝑅2=1−(∑𝑛𝑖=1(𝑝𝑖−𝑎𝑖)2∑𝑛𝑖=1(𝑎𝑖)2)

MRE(%)=1𝑛∑𝑖=1𝑛∣∣∣100𝑝𝑖−𝑎𝑖𝑎𝑖∣∣∣

RMSE(%)=1𝑛∑𝑖=1𝑛(𝑝𝑖−𝑎𝑖)2‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾⎷
(9)
Step 3 The multi-objective glowworm swarm optimization (MOGSO) is utilized to produce a set of feasible solutions [51].

MOGSO is a powerful optimization technique to solve the trade-off analysis between the conflicting responses, which is derived from the natural behavior of glowworms in the night. The glowworms are randomly distributed in the design space. They are assigned a specific luminescent quantity called the luciferin and produce a light. The glowworms interact with other swarms using a variable neighborhood. The neighborhood is located local-decision domain with a variable range rid (0 < rid < rs), which is bounded by a radial sensor range (rs). When the luciferin value of the glowworm jth is higher than that of glowworm ith, the glowworm ith considers the glowworm jth as a neighbor (Fig. 4a). The connections with the neighborhoods of each glowworm are decided based on the available information. The glowworm ith is in the sensor range of both glowworm jth and glowworm kth. Unfortunately, the glowworm jth and glowworm kth have different neighborhood sizes and only the glowworm jth uses the information of the glowworm ith. When a glowworm provides higher luciferin, it can attract other glowworms. Each glowworm will find and move to the brighter glowworm having the strongest luciferin using the probabilistic mechanism (Fig. 4b). The luciferin level of a glowworm’s neighbors affects its decision radius and determines the size of its local-decision domain. A low quantity of the luciferin causes an enlarged local-decision domain to search for more neighbors. In contrast, the local-decision domain allows the swarm to split into smaller groups.

The MOGSO comprises three primary stages, including luciferin-updated, movement, and local-decision range-updated phases, as shown in Fig. 5.

Fig. 5

The MOGSO algorithm

Full size image
The luciferin-updated phase: The population of the glowworms is randomly assigned in the design space. All glowworms have an equal quantity of the luciferin l0. Each glowworm adds a quantity of the luciferin based on its current position. A small portion of the luciferin quantity is subtracted to perform the simulation of the decay in time. The updated rule is expressed as:

𝑙𝑖(𝑡+1)=(1−𝜌)𝑙𝑖+𝛾𝐽(𝑥𝑖(𝑡+1))
(10)
where li(t) presents the luciferin quantity of the glowworm ith. ρ and γ present the decay and enhancing constants, respectively. J(xi(t)) denotes the response value of the glowworm ith.

The movement phase: A set of neighbors Ni(t) of the glowworm ith is obtained and computed as:

𝑁𝑖(𝑡)={𝑗:𝑑𝑖𝑗(𝑡)<𝑟𝑖𝑑(𝑡);𝑙𝑖(𝑡)<𝑙𝑗(𝑡)}
(11)
where dij(t) presents the Euclidean distance between glowworms ith and jth. rid (t) represents the variable neighborhood range of the individual ith.

The glowworm moves toward a neighbor having a higher luciferin value. In other words, the glowworm having a higher luciferin value will attract individuals having lowered one. The probability of moving toward a neighbor jth is expressed as:

𝑝𝑖𝑗(𝑡)=𝑙𝑗(𝑡)−𝑙𝑖(𝑡)∑𝑘∈𝑁𝑖(𝑡)𝑙𝑘(𝑡)−𝑙𝑖(𝑡)
(12)
The discrete-time model of the movement for the glowworm ith is expressed as:

𝑥𝑖(𝑡+1)=𝑥𝑖(𝑡)+𝑠𝑥𝑗(𝑡)−𝑥𝑖(𝑡)‖𝑙𝑘(𝑡)−𝑙𝑖(𝑡)‖
(13)
where ‖⋅‖ and s present the Euclidean norm operator and the step size, respectively.

The local-decision range-updated phase: The number of peaks captured is expected as a strong function of the radial sensor range with the agent ith. It is necessary to produce the sensor range using a varying parameter. Therefore, each agent ith is associated with a local-decision domain, which has a dynamic radial range. The proper function is selected to adaptively update the local-decision domain range of each glowworm and expressed as:

𝑟𝑖𝑑(𝑡+1)=min{𝑟𝑠,max{0,𝑟𝑖𝑑(𝑡)+𝛽(𝑛𝑡−|𝑁𝑖(𝑡)|}}
(14)
where β and nt present the constant parameter and parameter used to control the number of neighbors, respectively.

Step 4 The selection of the best optimality of MQL operating parameters and burnishing responses using the VIKOR method [52,53,54].

The VIKOR method is one of the effective approaches to decide the best point among feasible solutions, which can satisfy all contradictory responses. This approach is employed to rank feasible solutions in the design space that help the operator reach a final point.

The normalized value of the response is computed as:

𝑓𝑖𝑗=𝑥𝑖𝑗∑𝑚𝑖=1𝑥𝑖𝑗‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾√
(15)
where xij denotes the value of the jth performance.

The ideal solution (f*) and negative-ideal solution (f−) are computed as:

𝑓∗={(max𝑓𝑖𝑗/𝑗∈𝐽)OR(min𝑓𝑖𝑗/𝑗∈𝐽′)}
(16)
𝑓−={(max𝑓𝑖𝑗/𝑗∈𝐽)OR(min𝑓𝑖𝑗/𝑗∈𝐽′)}
(17)
The utility measure (Si) and regret measure (Ri) are computed as:

𝑆𝑖=∑𝑗=1𝑛𝑤𝑗(𝑓∗−𝑓𝑖𝑗)(𝑓∗𝑗−𝑓−𝑗)
(18)
𝑅𝑖=max[𝑤𝑗(𝑓∗−𝑓𝑖𝑗)(𝑓∗𝑗−𝑓−𝑗)]
(19)
where wj is the weigh value of each performance.

The VIKOR index (Vi) is calculated as:

𝑉𝑖=𝑣[(𝑆𝑖−𝑆∗)(𝑆−−𝑆∗)]+(1−𝑣)[(𝑅𝑖−𝑆∗)(𝑅−−𝑆∗)]
(20)
The optimal solution is selected with the smallest VIKOR index.

Step 5 The selection of optimal outcomes using the RSM and desirability approach.

To prove the efficiency of the proposed optimization approach comprising the ANN, MOGSO, and VIKOR, the empirical models of MAR and VH are developed. The RSM model is expressed as:

𝑦=𝛽0+∑𝑖=1𝑘𝛽𝑖⋅𝑥𝑖+∑𝑖=1𝑘𝛽𝑖𝑖⋅𝑥2𝑖+∑𝑖=1𝑘−1∑𝑗=𝑖+1𝑘𝛽𝑖𝑗⋅𝑥𝑖⋅𝑥𝑗+𝜀
(21)
where k and ε are the number of variables and error, respectively. βi, βii, and βij are the regression coefficients [55].

The desirability approach is employed to select the optimal values of the MQL system parameters and burnishing performances [56, 57].

For the maximizing purpose, the targeted desirability (di) is computed as:

𝑑𝑖=⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪0,(𝑌(𝑥)𝑖−𝐿(𝑥)𝑖𝐻(𝑥)𝑖−𝐿(𝑥)𝑖)𝑤,1,𝑌(𝑥)𝑖≤𝐿(𝑥)𝑖𝐿(𝑥)𝑖<𝑌(𝑥)𝑖<−𝐻(𝑥)𝑖𝑌(𝑥)𝑖≥𝐻(𝑥)𝑖
(22)
For the minimizing purpose, the targeted desirability (di) is computed as:

𝑑𝑖=⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪0,(𝐻(𝑥)𝑖−𝑌(𝑥)𝑖𝐻(𝑥)𝑖−𝐿(𝑥)𝑖)𝑤,1,𝑌(𝑥)𝑖≤𝐿(𝑥)𝑖𝐿(𝑥)𝑖<𝑌(𝑥)𝑖<−𝐻(𝑥)𝑖𝑌(𝑥)𝑖≥𝐻(𝑥)𝑖
(23)
For the aimed purpose, the targeted desirability (di) is computed as:

𝑑𝑖=⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪(𝑌(𝑥)𝑖−𝐿(𝑥)𝑖𝑇(𝑥)𝑖−𝐿(𝑥)𝑖)𝑤1,(𝑌(𝑥)𝑖−𝐻(𝑥)𝑖𝑇(𝑥)𝑖−𝐻(𝑥)𝑖)𝑤2,0,𝐿(𝑥)𝑖<𝑌(𝑥)𝑖<𝑇(𝑥)𝑖𝑇(𝑥)𝑖<𝑌(𝑥)𝑖<𝐻(𝑥)𝑖otherwise
(24)
For the range, the targeted desirability (di) is computed as:

𝑑𝑖={1,0,𝐿(𝑥)𝑖<𝑌(𝑥)𝑖<𝐻(𝑥)𝑖otherwise
(25)
where Li and Hi present the low and high responses, respectively. Ti and wi present targeted performance and the assigned weight, respectively.

For each performance, the total desirability (D) value is computed as:

𝐷=⎛⎝⎜⎜⎜𝑚Π𝐷𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖=1⎞⎠⎟⎟⎟1/∑𝑟𝑖
(26)
where m presents the number of burnishing performances.

Step 6 The optimal outcomes produced by the two optimization approaches are compared.

The optimal outcomes produced by two optimization techniques are compared to evaluate the effectiveness of each method.

Experimental setting for the roller burnishing operation
The burnishing trials are done with the aid of a vertical milling machine, in which the workpiece is tightly clamped using the precision vise (Fig. 6a). The minute amount of the soybean oil is mixed with the compressed air to form the oil mist. The minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) system having double jets is utilized to deliver the oil mist into the burnishing region. The MQL device is clamped on the machine table.

The burnishing samples are made of the hardened steel labeled 50Cr steel. The pre-machining processes, including the drilling and turning, are applied to produce the through-hole in each specimen. The workpiece dimensions are the length of 45.0 mm, the internal diameter of 30.0 mm, and the outer diameter of 40.0 mm, respectively. The maximum profile peak height of the roughness and Vickers hardness of the pre-machined surface are approximately 5.84 µm and 490.6 HV, respectively. The burnished samples are shown in Fig. 6b.

The tester, namely Mitutoyo Surftest-301, is used to capture roughness values in five different positions (Fig. 6c). The Vickers hardness is measured in three different points on the burnished surface using a tester, namely Wilson Wolpert (Fig. 6d). The measured specimen having dimensions of 10 × 10 × 6 mm3 is produced using the wire electrical discharge machining process. The pressed load of 29.42 N and the dwell time of 10 s are used for each hardness testing.

The operating parameters of the ANN model, including the network type (NT), the number of hidden neurons (NN), training function (TF), performance measure (PM), transfer function (TS), number of hidden layers (NL), and learning function (LF), and their levels are shown in Table 3.

Table 3 Operating parameters of the ANN model
Full size table
The four network types are the feed-forward back-propagation (FFNN), cascade feed-forward back-propagation (CFFNN), Elman back-propagation (ELNN), and layer recurrent neural network (LRNN). The fourteen training functions are BFGS quasi-Newton (TrainBFG), Bayesian regularization (TrainBR), conjugate gradient with Powell–Beale Restarts (TrainCGB), Fletcher–Powell conjugate gradient (TrainCGF), Polak–Ribie´re conjugate gradient (TrainCGP), gradient descent back-propagation (TrainGD), gradient descent with momentum back-propagation (TrainGDM), gradient descent with adaptive back-propagation (TrainGDA), gradient descent with momentum and adaptive lr back-propagation (TrainGDX), Levenberg–Marquardt back-propagation (TrainLM), one-step secant back-propagation (TrainOSS), random-order incremental training with learning functions (TrainR), resilient back-propagation (TrainRP), and scaled conjugate gradient back-propagation (TrainSCG). The performance measures are the mean squared error (MSE), mean squared error with regularization (MSEREG), and sum squared error (SSE). The transfer functions are the log sigmoid (logsig), linear (purelin), and hyperbolic tangent sigmoid (tansig). The learning functions include gradient descent with momentum weight and bias learning function (LearnGDM) and gradient descent weight and bias learning function (LearnGD). The orthogonal array matrix is produced based on combinations of ANN parameters. The training function and the number of hidden neurons have the highest level (14) and the learning function has the minimum level (2). Consequently, the designed matrix having 256 experiments is utilized to perform computational trials for the ANN model.

The training process of the developed ANN model is performed at input combinations using the designed matrix. The obtained outcomes with the acceptable PD values (less than 10%) for each ANN model are shown in Table 4. As a result, the optimal outcomes of the NT, NN, TF, PM, TS, NL, and LF are FFNN, TrainLM, 10, MSE, Logsig, 1, and Learn GDM, respectively (the trial No. 146). The PD values of the MAR and VH are 3.43% and 3.81%, respectively.

Table 4 Training results for the ANN model

As a result, an efficient network type, namely feed-forward back-propagation, is applied to describe complicated troubles in system modeling and identification. The Levenberg–Marquardt back-propagation (TrainLM) is employed as the training function to enhance the precise estimation. The mean squared error (MSE) is utilized to determine the failure function of the network. The logistic sigmoid (Logsig) is used as an active function to present highly nonlinear data, while the gradient descent with momentum weight and bias learning function (Learn GDM) is applied to compute the mass alteration for a dedicated neuron from the neuron’s input. The network having (4–10–2) topology has been used for predicting the input–output parameters, wherein there are four neurons for the input layer, ten neurons for the hidden layer, and two neurons for the output layer. The schematic view of the developed ANN is shown in Fig. 8.

ANOVA analysis is applied to evaluate parametric contributions, model significance, and model adequacy. The ANOVA results of the MAR model are presented in Table 6. The Model F-value of 62.6 implies the model is significant. The R2 value of 0.9865 indicated that 98.65% of the experimental data was presented by the MAR model. The adjusted R2 of 0.9782 indicated that 97.82% of experimental data could be presented using significant terms. The predicted R2 value of 0.9669 revealed that the MAR model could be used to explain the accuracy of 96.69% with any new data.

Analysis of influences of MQL operating parameters
The impacts of MQL operating parameters on the maximum peak height of roughness (MAR) are presented in Fig. 12.

The effects of MQL system parameters on the MAR

Full size image
Figure 12a presents the impact of the nozzle diameter on the MAR. It can be stated that the MAR decreases with an increased nozzle diameter. When the nozzle diameter relatively increases from 0.5 to 1.5 mm, the maximum roughness is relatively decreased by 5.9%. The phenomena can be explained as follows. At a lower nozzle diameter, a small amount of the oil mist is delivered into the burnishing region. This leads to improper cooling–lubrication efficiency at the interfaces, which increases the friction in the burnishing region; hence, the MAR increases. A higher diameter causes a larger droplet diameter and higher amount of the oil mist, which efficiently wets and protects the burnished surface; hence, the MAR decreases. Additionally, bulk cooling may occur with a larger nozzle diameter, which enhances the cooling–lubrication effectiveness. The friction between the workpiece surface and rollers is then reduced, resulting in a decrease in the MAR.

Figure 12b presents the impact of the impingement angle on the MAR. It can be perceived that the contradictory trends of the MAR are observed under the variety of the impingement angle. The MAR reduces to a minimum value along with an increase in the impingement angle. A further increase in the impingement angle leads to an increase in the MAR. When the impingement angle relatively changes from 20 to 40 deg., the MAR is relatively decreased by 4.1%. In contrast, when the impingement angle relatively changes from 40 to 60 deg., the MAR is relatively increased by 5.9%. The phenomena can be explained as follows. For low impingement angle, the penetration of the oil mist is ineffective, resulting in a lack of proper cooling–lubrication efficiency at the interfaces; hence, the MAR increases. At a higher impingement angle, the mist flow is accurately delivered into the machining region, resulting in higher cooling–lubrication efficiency at the interfaces. The friction between the workpiece surface and rollers decreases; hence, the MAR decreases. However, further impingement angle leads to improper cooling–lubrication impact at the interfaces and the MAR sharply increases.

Figure 12c presents the impact of the flow rate of the lubricant on the MAR. As a result, a lower MAR is found with an increased flow rate. When the flow rate relatively increases from 30 to 130 ml/h, the MAR is relatively decreased by 9.5%. The phenomena can be explained as follows. A higher flow rate increases the number of oil droplets entering the contact zone. The cooling–lubrication efficiency will be improved due to friction reduction. In addition, the increase in oil quantity benefits the cooling impact. The burnished surface is wetted and protected due to the penetration of a higher amount of the oil mist. The cooling–lubrication efficiency at the interfaces is significantly enhanced; hence, the MAR significantly decreases.

Figure 11d presents the influence of the air pressure on the MAR. It can be perceived that the contradictory trends of the MAR are observed under the variety of the air pressure. The MAR reduces to a minimum value along with an increase in the air pressure. A further increase in the air pressure leads to an increase in the MAR. When the air pressure increases from 0.2 to 0.4 MPa, the MAR is relatively decreased by 3.9%. When the air pressure increases from 0.4 to 0.6 MPa, the MAR is relatively increased by 1.4%. The phenomena can be explained as follows. An increment in the air pressure causes a reduction in the droplet size of the oil mist, while the number of droplets and droplet velocity increase. The small droplet diameter increases the penetration ability into the burnishing region; hence, the cooling–lubrication efficiency enhances. The friction between the rollers and workpiece surface decreases, and the MAR reduces. However, for higher air pressure, a smaller mist droplet may spring back due to momentum effects and could not completely penetrate into the machining region. The cooling–lubrication efficiency at the interfaces decreases; hence, the MAR slightly increases.

The surface morphology at different MQL system factors is shown in Fig. 13. It can be stated that the pre-machined defects, such as grooves, holes, and waviness, can be eliminated with the aid of the roller burnishing process. At the middle value of the air pressure, a smooth surface is obtained due to effective cooling–lubrication efficiency, as presented in Fig. 11a. Further air pressure, the rough surface is produced because of an improper cooling–lubrication condition, as shown in Fig. 13b.

The impacts of MQL operating parameters on the Vickers hardness (VH) are presented in Fig. 14.

The effects of MQL system parameters on the Vickers hardness

Figure 14a presents the impact of the nozzle diameter on the VH. As a result, a higher Vickers hardness is found with an increment in the nozzle diameter. When the nozzle diameter increases from 0.5 to 1.5 mm, the Vickers hardness is relatively enhanced by 6.5%. The phenomena can be explained as follows. An increased diameter causes a larger droplet diameter and a higher amount of lubricant, which wets and protects the burnished surface; hence, the cooling–lubrication efficiency at the interfaces enhances. The machining temperature in the burnishing region decreases, which diminishes the residual stress; hence, the Vickers hardness enhances.

Figure 14b presents the impact of the impingement angle on the VH. It can be stated that the contradictory trends of the Vickers hardness are observed under the variety of the impingement angle. The Vickers hardness reduces to a minimum value along with an increase in the impingement angle. A further increase in the impingement angle leads to an increase in the Vickers hardness. When the impingement angle increases from 20 to 40 deg., the Vickers hardness is relatively improved by 4.1%. When the impingement angle increases from 40 to 60 deg., the Vickers hardness is relatively reduced by 1.7%. The phenomena can be explained as follows. An increased impingement angle causes an accurate penetration of the oil mist, which decreases the machining temperature at the interfaces; hence, a higher Vickers hardness is obtained. Further impingement angle leads to improper cooling–lubrication efficiency, which increases the burnishing temperature and the residual stress is relieved; hence, the Vickers hardness decreases.

Figure 14c presents the impact of the flow rate on the VH. It can be stated that a higher Vickers hardness is produced with an increased flow rate. When the flow rate increases from 30 to 130 ml/h, the Vickers hardness is improved by 10.3%. The phenomena can be explained as follows. An increased flow rate leads to a higher amount of lubricant, which wets and protects the machined surface. The machining temperature at the interfaces decreases due to efficient cooling–lubrication impact. The diminishing of the residual stress is then prevented; hence, a higher Vickers hardness is achieved.

Figure 14d presents the impact of the air pressure on the VH. It can be stated that a higher Vickers hardness is obtained with increased air pressure. When the air pressure increases from 0.2 to 0.6 MPa, the Vickers hardness is relatively improved by 7.7%. Increased pressure leads to a decreased droplet diameter and velocity. The oil mist is easily penetrated into the interfaces. Proper cooling–lubrication efficiency is obtained, which decreases the machining temperature; hence, the Vickers hardness is efficiently improved.

Optimization results produced by the ANN–MOPSO–VIKOR
The developed ANN models are applied to select the optimal outcomes with the aid of the MOGSO. The Pareto graphs are presented in Fig. 15. It can be stated that lower roughness (a good indicator) relates to a reduction in the Vickers hardness (a worsen index). In other words, the burnishing responses have contradictory trends and the MQL operating parameters have complex influences.

The VIKOR method is applied to decide the best optimal point among feasible solutions. Four alternative solutions produced by the VIKOR method are shown in Table 8. It can be stated that solution no. 243 is selected as the optimal point. As a result, the optimum values of the nozzle diameter, impingement angle, flow rate, and air pressure are 1.5 mm, 45 deg., 130 ml/h, and 0.6 MPa, respectively. The optimal values of the MAR and VH are 1.71 µm and 632.6 HV, respectively. The MAR is decreased by 17.0%, and the VH is enhanced by 14.0%, as compared to the common values used (Table 9).

To prove the efficiency of the MOGSO, a conventional optimizing technique entitled multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO) is utilized to select optimal outcomes. The optimal values produced by the MOPSO of the nozzle diameter, impingement angle, flow rate, and air pressure are 1.5 mm, 50 deg., 130 ml/h, and 0.6 MPa, respectively, while the corresponding outcomes of the MAR and VH are 1.73 µm and 632.1 HV, respectively (Table 10). It can be stated that the optimum outcomes produced by the MOGSO are better than the MOPSO one. In other words, the MOGSO is more effective and efficient than the MOPSO while dealing with multi-objective optimization of the internal roller burnishing operation.

Comparisons between the two optimization approaches
As a result, the R2 values of the ANN models for the MAR and VH are 0.9865 and 0.9884, while the R2 values of the RSM models for the MAR and VH are 0.9652 and 0.9664, respectively. The optimal values produced by the ANN–MOGSO–VIKOR of the MAR and VH are 1.71 µm and 632.6 HV, respectively. The selected outcomes generated by the RSM–desirability approach are 1.74 µm and 609.8 HV, respectively.

It can be stated the adequacy of the ANN models is higher than the RSM ones. The ANN models are more proper to describe the highly nonlinear data, as compared to the RSM correlations. Moreover, the optimal outcomes produced by the ANN–MOGSO–VIKOR are better than the RSM–desirability approach. Consequently, the ANN–MOGSO–VIKOR technique can be effectively employed to present the complicated data and provide global optimization results, as compared to the conventional method.

Scientific and industrial contributions
Different burnishing processes have been executed in the flooding condition, which requires a heavy consumption of lubricants. Unfortunately, this approach is not economical and eco-friendly in terms of sustainable manufacturing. Recently, the MQL is considered as one of the eco-friendly cooling–lubrication solutions with good environmental influences and cost-effectiveness. The MQL has become more prevalent and widely applied in different machining processes. The selection of optimal MQL system parameters is an urgent demand. In this work, a concept of the MQL-based internal roller burnishing process has been proposed and implemented to facilitate the machining hardened steel. The maximum profile peak height of the roughness (MAR) and Vickers hardness (VH) have been considered and optimized. The influences of the MQL system parameters including the computed contributions and trends affecting the burnishing performances were thoroughly analyzed. The burnishing process of the hardended 50 Cr steel has been proposed and performed to enhance two important indicators, including the MAR and VH. The scientific and industrial contributions can be expressed as follows:

The trade-off analysis between the maximum profile peak height of the roughness and Vickers hardness of the MQL-based internal roller burnishing operation has been solved by means of optimal MQL operating parameters. The obtained outcomes increase the applications of the MQL system into not only different burnishing processes but also machining operations.

The proposed ANN models presenting relationships between the MQL working parameters and the MAR as well as VH ensure the precision for the prediction purpose. The experimental efforts, working time, and production costs can be saved with the support of the developed correlations.

The Pareto front produced by the MOGSO can be efficiently and effectively applied to select the optimal outcomes of the MQL system parameters and burnishing responses. The proper determination of the MQL system parameters can be utilized to save production costs, processing time, and labor.

The ANN–MOGSO–VIKOR approach could be efficiently and effectively employed to construct the burnishing responses, identify the optimal outcomes, and solve the contradictory objectives. The optimal outcomes are selected using the optimizing technique, instead of human experience and/or trial-and-error method.

The obtained results of the present work provide effective and efficient information, which can help machinists to select the optimal MQL system parameters and enhance the burnishing performances. The obtained finding is a significant contribution to enhancements in the burnishing quality. The outcomes of the investigated study can be effectively employed for further researches regarding sustainable burnishing and developing expert systems for MQL-based burnishing applications in different industries.

Conclusions
In this investigation, the operating parameters of the MQL system, including the nozzle diameter (D), impingement angle (I), air pressure (P), and flow rate (F), have been optimized to decrease the maximum profile peak height of the roughness (MAR) and enhance the Vickers hardness (VH) for the minimum quantity lubrication-based burnishing operation. The ANN models of the burnishing responses were proposed in terms of the optimizing inputs. The MOGSO–VIKOR was applied to determine optimal values of burnishing parameters and objectives. Furthermore, the optimal outcomes were identified by the RSM–desirability and compared with the MOGSO-VIKOR one. The finding can be listed as below:

1.
The maximum levels of the nozzle diameter and flow rate can be employed to decrease the maximum profile peak height of the roughness, while the middle ranges of the impingement angle and air pressure are recommended. The highest levels of the nozzle diameter, flow rate, and air pressure can be applied to enhance the Vickers hardness, while the middle value of the impingement angle is recommended.

2.
All MQL system parameters have significant contributions to the ANN models of burnishing performances. For the MAR model, the flow rate is named as the most effective factor, followed by the nozzle diameter, air pressure, and impingement angle, respectively. For the VH model, the flow rate has the highest contribution, followed by the air pressure, nozzle diameter, and impingement angle, respectively.

3.
The 4–10–2 ANN architecture can be effectively and efficiently used to render the relations between MQL system factors and the maximum profile peak height of the roughness as well as Vickers hardness.

4.
The burnishing responses proposed by the ANN approach are adequate and significant. The response values of the minimum quantity lubrication-based burnishing operation of the hardened 50Cr steel can be efficiently predicted with the aid of the designed models.

5.
The optimal MWL parameters proposed by the MOGSO–VIKOR of the D, I, Q, and P are 1.5 mm, 45 deg., 130 ml/h, and 0.6 MPa, respectively. The VH is enhanced by 14.0%, while the reduction in the MAR is approximately 17.0% at the best optimal solution. The MOGSO provides better optimal outcomes than the conventional one (MOPSO). The ANN–MOGSO–VIKOR approach was more efficient than the RSM–desirability to solve the complicated optimization issue.

6.
This current investigation addressed the maximum profile peak height of the roughness and Vickers hardness regarding the MQL system factors. The impacts of MQL operating parameters on the compressive stress, the depth of the affected layer, production costs, and carbon emissions will be analyzed in future investigations.
