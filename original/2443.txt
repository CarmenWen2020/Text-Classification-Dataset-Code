Curtain grouting efficiency evaluation is vital to ensure the safety and stability of dam foundation constructions. However, the existing grouting efficiency evaluations rarely consider the intrapersonal uncertainty and interpersonal uncertainty involved in the indicator weight determination and cannot objectively reflect the impact of different indicator values on the evaluation results, which may lead to inaccurate results. To address these issues, a variable weight-based interval type-2 fuzzy rough comprehensive evaluation method is proposed. The interval type-2 fuzzy rough AHP is developed to determine the indicator weights under intrapersonal and interpersonal uncertainties, specifically, the individual linguistic judgment is expressed by interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs), then the individual judgments are aggregated by rough sets to establish the interval type-2 fuzzy rough number to simultaneously handle individual linguistic vagueness and group preference diversity; furthermore, the multi-attributive border approximation area comparison (MABAC) method extended by variable weight theory is adopted to conduct the grouting efficiency evaluation, and it takes into account the influence of indicator value variations, where the indicator weight can be adjusted according to its actual value to obtain more objective and reliable evaluation results. Finally, the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method are illustrated through a practical case study application and comparisons with several different methods. The proposed model has powerful uncertainty handling capacity and can truly reveal the severity of a problem, ensures more objective and comprehensive evaluation results and is highly practical, which can help grouting engineers judge grouting efficiency more scientifically and effectively.

Introduction
Grouting construction is full of challenges because of its characteristic of professionalism and concealment [1]. As the construction of high dams gradually expands to more complicated areas, grouting construction becomes more difficult and complex due to the increasing uncertainty and complexity of the geological conditions. To ensure the construction quality of the dam foundation and the safe operation of the dam, higher requirements for the efficiency of grouting have been put forward. Grouting efficiency evaluation is recognized as an important activity since its results can reveal inefficient grouting areas and provide guidance for grouting engineers in remedial grouting. Due to the objective existence of the complexity and ambiguity of indicators in the process of evaluation, as well as the fuzziness and subjectivity of human cognition, unreliable evaluation results are possible. Therefore, the grouting efficiency evaluation which considers the influence of above multiple uncertainties can significantly contribute to the improvement of the dam foundation’s strength and impermeability.

In regard to grouting efficiency evaluations, many scholars have carried out extensive research. In recent years, instead of single-factor methods that can only reflect the limited results of a particular aspect of grouting efficiency [2,3,4,5,6,7,8], the multifactor comprehensive evaluation of grouting efficiency has become a promising new method. Fan et al. [9] established a multiple evaluation indicators system that included permeability (LU), rock quality designation (RQD) and fracture filled rate (FFR), then determined the indicator weight based on the AHP method extended by D numbers, and made a hybrid fuzzy evaluation for curtain grouting efficiency. Zhu et al. [10] used a cloud model-based AHP method to obtain the indicator weights and evaluated the curtain grouting efficiency by cloud model-based fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. And Liu et al. [11] proposed a comprehensive evaluation model for curtain grouting efficiency assessment based on prospect theory and interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets, which considered the hesitation and the bounded rationality of experts in the evaluation process. These studies put forward some new methods, which effectively evaluated the grouting efficiency. However, experts usually face uncertainties and various changes in the evaluation process. The above methods are still limited to incomplete or simplified considerations of uncertainty factors to a certain extent.

Specifically, the previous grouting efficiency evaluation studies failed to fully consider two aspects of uncertainties in the evaluation process: (1) uncertainties in the indicator weight determination and (2) uncertainties in multi-indicator comprehensive evaluation. In the first aspect, the indicator weight determination is a potential source of uncertainty [12], which is not only affected by the subjectivity and vagueness of expert judgment but is also affected by the inconsistency and diversity of different experts’ judgments. In another respect, the relationship between the indicators and the final evaluation level is nonlinear and complex [10], and influenced by the complexity of the engineering environment and the invisibility of the grouting construction, the indicator value is variable, which leads to uncertainty and dynamic variability in the influence of the indicator value on the evaluation results. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a more comprehensive and effective way to objectively and reliably evaluate grouting efficiency while considering uncertainties in the above two aspects.

The determination of the indicator weights is of great importance, and the rationality of the weights directly affects the evaluation results [13]. Among the existing weight calculation methods, the AHP is the most popular and has been widely used in various multi-criteria decision problems to acquire the weight coefficient of the indicators [14, 15]. The AHP method, with characteristics of a rational hierarchy structure and convenient mathematical calculation, can handle complex decisions and it is easy for decision makers to give weights for each indicator [16, 17]. Some studies have pointed out that the inconsistency problem of the pairwise comparison matrix will occur if the pairwise comparison matrix is 5 × 5 or larger in AHP [18]. In this study, there is no such consistency problem because there are only four evaluation indicators, and the pairwise comparison matrix is 4 × 4 in the decision structure. In addition, to make the grouting efficiency assessment model simple, interpretable and easy to operate, AHP is a suitable method. In the traditional AHP method, decision makers need to give a crisp number in the range of 1–9 when making pairwise comparisons in order to calculate the priority vector. However, in the actual decision-making process, decision makers are subject to ambiguous thinking and expressions, which makes them unable to articulate their preferences by using crisp numbers; rather, they prefer linguistic variables to express their views [19].

In these situations, type-1 fuzzy sets (T1FSs) such as ordinary fuzzy sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets and picture fuzzy sets, have been used to express and process linguistic uncertainties [18, 20, 21]. Nevertheless, T1FSs are insufficient to model the uncertainties when facing more complex and uncertain situations because their membership degree is described by a crisp number in [0, 1] [22, 23]. As an extension of T1FSs, type-2 fuzzy sets (T2FSs) with fuzzy membership degrees were proposed by Zadeh [24], which expands the range of the memberships. The T2FSs are designed with two membership degrees consisting of a primary membership degree and a secondary membership degree. This three-dimensional feature makes it more flexible in expressing uncertainty [25]. Therefore, compared with T1FSs, T2FSs are more appropriate in terms of tackling uncertainties related to linguistic terms, and can be regarded as an efficient method to address higher uncertainties [26]. However, T2FSs contain complex and heavy computational operations that hinder their real-world application, while interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) are a special kind of general T2FSs that are easy to apply and require less computational effort; thus, IT2FSs are widely used in numerous multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) applications, and can represent more uncertainties to obtain more accurate and robust results [25, 27, 28].

As mentioned above, IT2FSs are powerful for handling intrapersonal uncertainty caused by person’s vagueness in thinking and preference expressions [29, 30]. However, the judgments made by different decision makers vary due to their diverse understanding of identical situations, so finding ways to objectively aggregate these judgments is another important task. Some existing weighted averaging operators can solve this issue [31,32,33], but they all involve additional subjective predefined parameters [34] and cannot manipulate interpersonal uncertainty. Fortunately, the rough set theory proposed by Pawlak [35] is an efficient method for dealing with uncertainty without being affected by subjectivism, and has been widely applied to aggregate multiple judgments since it can manipulate interpersonal uncertainty caused by the subjectivity and diversity of different decision makers [34, 36,37,38,39]. Considering the merit of IT2FSs in manipulating individual linguistic vagueness, and the strength of rough sets in addressing group preference diversity, IT2FSs and rough sets are complementary in resolving the uncertainties in decision-making problems. Therefore, this paper employs the rough set method to modify IT2FSs and proposes an interval type-2 fuzzy rough number. Subsequently, an interval type-2 fuzzy rough AHP is presented to determine the indicator weights, which enables experts to make more objective judgments on indicators in a subjective and uncertain environment.

Based on the determined indicator weights, the MCDM method, as a type of multi-indicator comprehensive evaluation method, is adopted to address the grouting efficiency assessment problem. The multi-attributive border approximation area comparison (MABAC) method proposed by Pamučar [40] is a more recent and effective MCDM method that avoids subjective impact because it does not need to determine the membership function. The mission of this method is to make the evaluation results as accurate as possible by calculating the potential gain and loss values [41]. Compared with other MCDM methods, such as TOPSIS, MOORA and VIKOR, MABAC is a particularly pragmatic and reliable method for rational decision making, which has a simple computation process and a well-structured analytical framework. It can acquire a robust evaluation result and has wide application in practical decision making and evaluation problems [15, 42, 43]. During the evaluation process, when some of the indicator values drastically deviate from the normal value, it may indicate that the grouting efficiency of a certain area is very poor. However, the introduced interval type-2 fuzzy rough AHP method is a constant weight model that assigns a fixed weight to each indicator regardless of the variation in the indicator values for different conditions; thus, the impact of these indicators on the overall evaluation results cannot be objectively reflected because these indicators were not viewed as critical and may be neutralized by other indicators with normal values. This will lead to inaccurate evaluation results and cannot highlight the severity of a problem. To solve this problem, the variable weight theory [44], which has been applied in numerous studies [45, 46], is presented to adjust the indicator weight according to the indicator value to accurately reflect the impact on the evaluation results caused by the variation of the indicator value. Therefore, this study uses variable weight theory to improve the MABAC method, thereby achieving reasonable weights and rendering comprehensive decisions more reliable and scientific.

In summary, the main aim of this study is to propose a MCDM framework for the comprehensive evaluation of curtain grouting efficiency under multiple uncertainties. First, the evaluation indicator system including four indicators is established, it can systematically elaborate the grouting efficiency situation with respect to the permeability and tightness of the grout curtain. Second, we proposed an interval type-2 fuzzy rough number to incorporate the rough sets into IT2FSs, and then the indicator weights are obtained using the interval type-2 fuzzy rough AHP method, which combines the advantages of IT2FSs and rough sets to manipulate the intrapersonal and interpersonal uncertainties simultaneously, and strengthen the objectivity under subjective environments. Finally, the extended MABAC method is adopted to comprehensively consider multiple indicators to identify the grouting efficiency level, in which the variable weight theory is used to adjust the constant weight with the variation of indicator value to make evaluation results more realistic. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed methodology are illustrated through the application to a curtain grouting efficiency assessment of a hydropower station in China, and some comparison analyses are conducted to prove its superiority and feasibility.

The remainder of this paper are organized into the following sections. After the introduction in Sect. 1, the 2nd section describes the methodologies of the proposed variable weight-based interval type-2 fuzzy rough multi-criteria decision-making approach. The approach is later verified in Sect. 3 by means of a case study in which the curtain grouting efficiency assessment of a hydropower project in China is conducted. The 4th section presents some comparisons and discussions to validate the proposed approach. Finally, the conclusions of this research are summarized in the 5th section and further research perspectives are established.

The proposed curtain grouting efficiency evaluation method
To address the uncertainties and subjectivity in the comprehensive evaluations of grouting efficiency, a variable weight-based interval type-2 fuzzy rough MCDM approach is proposed in this study. This approach combines an interval type-2 fuzzy rough AHP method and a variable weight theory-based extended MABAC method. The comprehensive evaluation process includes the following three stages: (1) determination and acquisition of evaluation indicators; (2) invite a group of experts to make decisions on the relative importance of the evaluation indicators, then calculate the relative weight of evaluation indicators by the interval type-2 fuzzy rough AHP; and (3) according to the obtained evaluation indicator data, a comprehensive evaluation of the grouting efficiency is conducted using the extended MABAC based on variable weight theory. The framework of the proposed comprehensive evaluation approach is depicted in Fig. 1.

The evaluation indicator system and indicator acquisition
For an efficiency evaluation of curtain grouting, to comprehensively and objectively reflect the grouting efficiency, the construction of a scientific and complete evaluation indicator system is necessary. Considering that the main purpose of a dam foundation curtain grouting is to increase the compactness of the rock mass and reduce seepage, we set the permeability and tightness as the criteria, and select the permeability (LU), rock quality designation (RQD), fracture filled rate (FFR) and acoustic velocity (V) as evaluation indicators according to the actual engineering. Thus, a three-layer hierarchical evaluation indicator system is established as shown in Fig. 2, which consists of objective layer, criteria layer and indicator layer.

The acquisitions of LU, RQD, FFR and V are based on the results of in situ tests, including water pressure tests (WPT), core specimen drilling, borehole television imaging and acoustic velocity tests. The specific calculations are introduced as follows:

LU is the Lugeon value (Lu), which expresses the permeability rate of the rock mass obtained by WPT [47]. The definition of LU is as follows:

𝐿𝑈=𝑄𝑃⋅𝐿
(1)
where Q is the flow rate in L/min, P is the effective pressure of WPT in MPa, and L is the length of the tested interval in m.

RQD is a quantitative indicator to assess rock quality that was first proposed by Deere [48], it is defined as the percentage of the length of intact core longer than 10 cm (Li) in the total core length (L), which is expressed as Eq. (2):

RQD=∑𝐿𝑖𝐿×100%.
(2)
FFR is the ratio of the fractures filled by grout, which can be observed from borehole television imaging and core specimen drilling. The calculation of FFR is:

𝐹𝐹𝑅=𝑁filled𝑁all×100%
(3)
where Nfilled and Nall are the number of fractures filled by grout and the total number of fractures in one tested interval, respectively.

V is determined by an acoustic wave test on dam foundation rock, which has a strong correlation with the elastic modulus. For the rocks with good integrity, the propagation paths of acoustic waves are often short, and the acoustic velocity V is relatively high.

Interval type-2 fuzzy set
Definition 1
If all 𝜇𝐴̃ ̃ (𝑥,𝑢)=1, then 𝐴̃ ̃  is called an interval type-2 fuzzy set (IT2FS), which can be regarded as a special case of a type-2 fuzzy set and represented as follows:

𝐴̃ ̃ ={((𝑥,𝑢),𝜇𝐴̃ ̃ (𝑥,𝑢))∣∣∀𝑥∈𝑋,∀𝑢∈𝐽𝑥⊆[0,1],0≤𝜇𝐴̃ ̃ (𝑥,𝑢)≤1}
(4)
where Jx denotes an interval [0,1]. Moreover, the type-2 fuzzy set 𝐴̃ ̃  can also be represented as follows:

𝐴̃ ̃ =∫𝑥∈𝑋∫𝑢∈𝐽𝑥𝜇𝐴̃ ̃ (𝑥,𝑢)/(𝑥,𝑢)
(5)
where 𝐽𝑥⊆[0,1] and ∫∫ denotes union over all admissible x and u. Here, x is called the primary variable, and its domain is represented by X. The secondary variable is represented by u ∈ [0,1], and its domain is given by 𝐽𝑥⊆[0,1] at each x ∈ X. Jx is called the primary membership of x, and the amplitude of 𝜇𝐴̃ ̃ (𝑥,𝑢) is called the secondary grade of 𝐴̃ ̃ .

If all 𝜇𝐴̃ ̃ (𝑥,𝑢)=1, then 𝐴̃ ̃  is called an interval type-2 fuzzy set (IT2FS), which can be regarded as a special case of a type-2 fuzzy set and represented as follows:

𝐴̃ ̃ =∫𝑥∈𝑋∫𝑢∈𝐽𝑥1/(𝑥,𝑢)
(6)
where 𝐽𝑥⊆[0,1]. Note that the secondary grades of interval type-2 fuzzy sets are equal to 1.

The triangular interval type-2 fuzzy set is a special case of IT2FS. A triangular interval type-2 fuzzy number can be expressed as 𝐴̃ ̃ =(𝑎𝑢,𝑎𝑙)=((𝑎𝑢1,𝑎𝑢2,𝑎𝑢3,ℎ𝑢𝐴̃ ),(𝑎𝑙1,𝑎𝑙2,𝑎𝑙3,ℎ𝑙𝐴̃ )). The upper membership function 𝜇𝑢𝐴̃ (𝑥) is determined by (𝑎𝑢1,𝑎𝑢2,𝑎𝑢3) with height ℎ𝑢𝐴̃ , and the lower membership function 𝜇𝑙𝐴̃ (𝑥) is determined by (𝑎𝑙1,𝑎𝑙2,𝑎𝑙3) with height ℎ𝑙𝐴̃ . The normal IT2FS 𝐴̃ ̃  has ℎ𝑢𝐴̃ =1 and ℎ𝑙𝐴̃ ≤1.

The footprint of uncertainty (FOU) is expressed by the union of its primary memberships as:

FOU(𝐴̃ ̃ )=∪𝑥∈𝑋𝐽𝑥={(𝑥,𝑢):𝑢∈𝐽𝑥⊆[0,1]}.
(7)
In the IT2FSs, 𝜇𝑢𝐴̃ (𝑥) and 𝜇𝑙𝐴̃ (𝑥) are the upper bound and lower bound of the FOU, respectively. Therefore, the FOU of IT2FSs 𝐴̃ ̃  expressed in Eq. (7) can also be written as the union of its upper and lower membership functions. A classical triangular IT2FS is depicted in Fig. 3.

Interval type-2 fuzzy rough number
Due to the advantages of rough numbers in information aggregation, this paper extends the application of rough sets to the manipulation of IT2FSs and proposes an interval type-2 fuzzy rough number.

Basically, an interval type-2 fuzzy rough number has the same concept of a lower limit, upper limit and rough boundary interval as a conventional rough number [35]. Let U be the universe, which contains the evaluation values collected from the decision makers. These values can be divided into m classes, which are ordered as 𝐶̃ ̃ 1≤𝐶̃ ̃ 2≤…≤𝐶̃ ̃ 𝑚.𝐶̃ ̃ 𝑖(1≤𝑖≤𝑚) is an interval type-2 fuzzy number, 𝐶̃ ̃ 𝑖=((𝑐𝑢𝑖1,𝑐𝑢𝑖2,𝑐𝑢𝑖3,ℎ𝑢𝐶̃ 𝑖),(𝑐𝑙𝑖1,𝑐𝑙𝑖2,𝑐𝑙𝑖3,ℎ𝑙𝐶̃ 𝑖)).𝑅̃ ̃  is the collection of {𝐶̃ ̃ 1,𝐶̃ ̃ 2,…,𝐶̃ ̃ 𝑚}. Y is an arbitrary element in the universe, then the lower approximation of class 𝐶̃ ̃ 𝑖 can be defined as:

𝐴𝑝𝑟⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖1)=∪{𝑌∈𝑈/𝑅̃ ̃ (𝑌)≤𝑐𝑢𝑖1}𝐴𝑝𝑟⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖2)=∪{𝑌∈𝑈/𝑅̃ ̃ (𝑌)≤𝑐𝑢𝑖2}𝐴𝑝𝑟⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖3)=∪{𝑌∈𝑈/𝑅̃ ̃ (𝑌)≤𝑐𝑢𝑖3}
(8)
𝐴𝑝𝑟⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖1)=∪{𝑌∈𝑈/𝑅̃ ̃ (𝑌)≤𝑐𝑙𝑖1}𝐴𝑝𝑟⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖2)=∪{𝑌∈𝑈/𝑅̃ ̃ (𝑌)≤𝑐𝑙𝑖2}𝐴𝑝𝑟⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖3)=∪{𝑌∈𝑈/𝑅̃ ̃ (𝑌)≤𝑐𝑙𝑖3}.
(9)
Likewise, the upper approximation of class 𝐶̃ ̃ 𝑖 can be defined as:

𝐴𝑝𝑟⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖1)=∪{𝑌∈𝑈/𝑅̃ ̃ (𝑌)≥𝑐𝑢𝑖1}𝐴𝑝𝑟⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖2)=∪{𝑌∈𝑈/𝑅̃ ̃ (𝑌)≥𝑐𝑢𝑖2}𝐴𝑝𝑟⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖3)=∪{𝑌∈𝑈/𝑅̃ ̃ (𝑌)≥𝑐𝑢𝑖3}
(10)
𝐴𝑝𝑟⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖1)=∪{𝑌∈𝑈/𝑅̃ ̃ (𝑌)≥𝑐𝑙𝑖1}𝐴𝑝𝑟⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖2)=∪{𝑌∈𝑈/𝑅̃ ̃ (𝑌)≥𝑐𝑙𝑖2}𝐴𝑝𝑟⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖3)=∪{𝑌∈𝑈/𝑅̃ ̃ (𝑌)≥𝑐𝑙𝑖3}.
(11)
Then, the lower limit of 𝐶̃ ̃ 𝑖 is described as:

𝐿𝑖𝑚⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖1)=1𝑁𝑢𝐿1∑𝑖=1𝑁𝑢𝐿1𝑌∈𝐴𝑝𝑟⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖1)𝐿𝑖𝑚⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖2)=1𝑁𝑢𝐿2∑𝑖=1𝑁𝑢𝐿2𝑌∈𝐴𝑝𝑟⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖2)𝐿𝑖𝑚⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖3)=1𝑁𝑢𝐿3∑𝑖=1𝑁𝑢𝐿3𝑌∈𝐴𝑝𝑟⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖3)
(12)
𝐿𝑖𝑚⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖1)=1𝑁𝑙𝐿1∑𝑖=1𝑁𝑙𝐿1𝑌∈𝐴𝑝𝑟⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖1)𝐿𝑖𝑚⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖2)=1𝑁𝑙𝐿2∑𝑖=1𝑁𝑙𝐿2𝑌∈𝐴𝑝𝑟⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖2)𝐿𝑖𝑚⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖3)=1𝑁𝑙𝐿3∑𝑖=1𝑁𝑙𝐿3𝑌∈𝐴𝑝𝑟⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖3)
(13)
where 𝑁𝑢𝐿1, 𝑁𝑙𝐿1, 𝑁𝑢𝐿2, 𝑁𝑙𝐿2, 𝑁𝑢𝐿3, 𝑁𝑙𝐿3 are the number of elements in Apr⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖1), Apr⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖1), Apr⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖2), Apr⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖2),Apr⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖3), Apr⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖3), respectively.

Correspondingly, the upper limit of 𝐶̃ ̃ 𝑖 is described as:

𝐿𝑖𝑚⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖1)=1𝑁𝑢𝑈1∑𝑖=1𝑁𝑢𝑈1𝑌∈𝐴𝑝𝑟⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖1)𝐿𝑖𝑚⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖2)=1𝑁𝑢𝑈2∑𝑖=1𝑁𝑢𝑈2𝑌∈𝐴𝑝𝑟⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖2)𝐿𝑖𝑚⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖3)=1𝑁𝑢𝑈3∑𝑖=1𝑁𝑢𝑈3𝑌∈𝐴𝑝𝑟⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖3)
(14)
Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖1)=1𝑁𝑙𝑈1∑𝑖=1𝑁𝑙𝑈1𝑌∈Apr⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖1)Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖2)=1𝑁𝑙𝑈2∑𝑖=1𝑁𝑙𝑈2𝑌∈Apr⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖2)Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖3)=1𝑁𝑙𝑈3∑𝑖=1𝑁𝑙𝑈3𝑌∈Apr⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖3)
(15)
where 𝑁𝑢𝑈1, 𝑁𝑙𝑈1, 𝑁𝑢𝑈2, 𝑁𝑙𝑈2, 𝑁𝑢𝑈3, 𝑁𝑙𝑈3 are the number of elements in Apr⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖1), Apr⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖1), Apr⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖2), Apr⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖2),Apr⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖3), Apr⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖3), respectively.

Then, the interval type-2 fuzzy rough number of 𝐶̃ ̃ 𝑖 can be denoted as:

IT2FRN(𝐶̃ ̃ 𝑖)={([Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖1),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖1)],[Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖2),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖2)],[Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖3),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑢𝑖3)],ℎ𝑢𝐶̃ 𝑖),([Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖1),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖1)],[Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖2),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖2)],[Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖3),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑐𝑙𝑖3)],ℎ𝑙𝐶̃ 𝑖)}.

Step 1 Integrated pairwise comparison matrix construction.

Collect judgments about the evaluation indicator from each expert and build the corresponding interval type-2 fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix according to the hierarchical evaluation indicator system. The interval type-2 fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix obtained from expert e is represented as:

𝑀̃ ̃ 𝑒=⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢1𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑒21⋮𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑒𝑝1𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑒121⋮𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑒𝑝2⋯⋯⋱⋯𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑒1𝑝𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑒2𝑝⋮1⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥=⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢11𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑒12⋮1𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑒1𝑝𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑒121⋮1𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑒2𝑝⋯⋯⋱⋯𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑒1𝑝𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑒2𝑝⋮1⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥
(22)
where 𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑒𝑖𝑗=((𝑥𝑢𝑒𝑖𝑗1,𝑥𝑢𝑒𝑖𝑗2,𝑥𝑢𝑒𝑖𝑗3,ℎ𝑢𝑒𝑥˜𝑒𝑖𝑗),(𝑥𝑙𝑒𝑖𝑗1,𝑥𝑙𝑒𝑖𝑗2,𝑥𝑙𝑒𝑖𝑗3,ℎ𝑙𝑒𝑥̃ 𝑒𝑖𝑗)), 1𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑒𝑖𝑗=((1𝑥𝑢𝑒𝑖𝑗3,1𝑥𝑢𝑒𝑖𝑗2,1𝑥𝑢𝑒𝑖𝑗1,ℎ𝑢𝑒𝑥̃ 𝑒𝑖𝑗),(1𝑥𝑙𝑒𝑖𝑗3,1𝑥𝑙𝑒𝑖𝑗2,1𝑥𝑙𝑒𝑖𝑗1,ℎ𝑙𝑒𝑥̃ 𝑒𝑖𝑗)), 1≤𝑖,𝑗≤𝑝. The linguistic terms and their interval type-2 fuzzy scales, which will be used in interval type-2 fuzzy rough AHP, are given in Table 1 [28].

After the construction of 𝑀̃ ̃ 𝑒, the consistency test of each interval type-2 fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix is carried out. In this step, if the result of the defuzzified M obtained using the center of area method [50] is consistent, then the result of 𝑀̃ ̃ 𝑒 is also consistent. The consistency ratio (CR) is defined as:

CR=CIRI
(23)
where CI is the consistency index and RI is the random consistency index, which is listed in Table 2, and

𝐶𝐼=𝜆𝑒max−𝑝𝑝−1
(24)
where 𝜆𝑒max is the maximum eigenvalue of 𝑀̃ ̃ 𝑒 and p is the number of evaluation indicators.

Table 2 Random consistency index (RI)
Full size table
If CR < 0.1, the pairwise comparison matrix is satisfactory. Otherwise, the judgment matrix should be adjusted until CR < 0.1.

Then, all the individual pairwise comparison matrices are integrated to construct an integrated pairwise comparison matrix, which is represented as:

𝑀̃ ̃ =⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢1𝑥̃ ̃ 21⋮𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑝1𝑥̃ ̃ 121⋮𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑝2⋯⋯⋱⋯𝑥̃ ̃ 1𝑝𝑥̃ ̃ 2𝑝⋮1⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥
(25)
where 𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑖𝑗={𝑥̃ ̃ 1𝑖𝑗,𝑥̃ ̃ 2𝑖𝑗,…,𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑛𝑖𝑗}, 1≤𝑖,𝑗≤𝑝 is the integrated pairwise comparison value of indicator i on indicator j, n is the number of the decision makers. 𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑖𝑗 can also be represented as 𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑖𝑗=((𝑥𝑢𝑖𝑗1,𝑥𝑢𝑖𝑗2,𝑥𝑢𝑖𝑗3,ℎ𝑢𝑥̃ 𝑖𝑗),(𝑥𝑙𝑖𝑗1,𝑥𝑙𝑖𝑗2,𝑥𝑙𝑖𝑗3,ℎ𝑙𝑥̃ 𝑖𝑗)), where 𝑥𝑢𝑖𝑗1={𝑥𝑢1𝑖𝑗1,𝑥𝑢2𝑖𝑗1,…,𝑥𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑗1}, 𝑥𝑢𝑖𝑗2={𝑥𝑢1𝑖𝑗2,𝑥𝑢2𝑖𝑗2,…,𝑥𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑗2}, 𝑥𝑢𝑖𝑗3={𝑥𝑢1𝑖𝑗3,𝑥𝑢2𝑖𝑗3,…,𝑥𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑗3}, 𝑥𝑙𝑖𝑗1={𝑥𝑙1𝑖𝑗1,𝑥𝑙2𝑖𝑗1,…,𝑥𝑙𝑛𝑖𝑗1}, 𝑥𝑙𝑖𝑗2={𝑥𝑙1𝑖𝑗2,𝑥𝑙2𝑖𝑗2,…,𝑥𝑙𝑛𝑖𝑗2} and 𝑥𝑙𝑖𝑗3={𝑥𝑙1𝑖𝑗3,𝑥𝑙2𝑖𝑗3,…,𝑥𝑙𝑛𝑖𝑗3}.

Step 2 Interval type-2 fuzzy rough number generation and interval type-2 fuzzy rough pairwise comparison matrix construction.

Given the 𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑖𝑗 in the integrated pairwise comparison matrix 𝑀̃ ̃ , the element 𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑒𝑖𝑗 can be transformed to an interval type-2 fuzzy rough number using Eqs. (8)–(16):

IT2FRN(𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑒𝑖𝑗)={([Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢𝑖𝑗1),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢𝑖𝑗1)],[Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢𝑖𝑗2),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢𝑖𝑗2)],[Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢𝑖𝑗3),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢𝑖𝑗3)],ℎ𝑢𝑥̃ 𝑒𝑖𝑗),([Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑙𝑖𝑗1),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑙𝑖𝑗1)],[Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑙𝑖𝑗2),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑙𝑖𝑗2)],[Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑙𝑖𝑗3),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑙𝑖𝑗3)],ℎ𝑙𝑥̃ 𝑒𝑖𝑗)}
(26)
Then, 𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑖𝑗 is described as a sequence of interval type-2 fuzzy rough numbers.

IT2FRN(𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑖𝑗)=⟨IT2FRN(𝑥̃ ̃ 1𝑖𝑗),IT2FRN(𝑥̃ ̃ 2𝑖𝑗),…,IT2FRN(𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑛𝑖𝑗)⟩=⟨{([Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢1𝑖𝑗1),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢1𝑖𝑗1)],[Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢1𝑖𝑗2),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢1𝑖𝑗2)],[Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢1𝑖𝑗3),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢1𝑖𝑗3)],ℎ𝑢𝑥̃ 1𝑖𝑗),([Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑙1𝑖𝑗1),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑙1𝑖𝑗1)],[Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑙1𝑖𝑗2),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑙1𝑖𝑗2)],[Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑙1𝑖𝑗3),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑙1𝑖𝑗3)],ℎ𝑙𝑥̃ 1𝑖𝑗)};{([Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢2𝑖𝑗1),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢2𝑖𝑗1)],[Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢2𝑖𝑗2),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢2𝑖𝑗2)],[Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢2𝑖𝑗3),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢2𝑖𝑗3)],ℎ𝑢𝑥̃ 2𝑖𝑗),([Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑙2𝑖𝑗1),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑙2𝑖𝑗1)],[Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑙2𝑖𝑗2),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑙2𝑖𝑗2)],[Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑙2𝑖𝑗3),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑙2𝑖𝑗3)],ℎ𝑙𝑥̃ 2𝑖𝑗)};…{([Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑗1),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑗1)],[Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑗2),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑗2)],[Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑗3),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑗3)],ℎ𝑢𝑥̃ 𝑛𝑖𝑗),([Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥ln𝑖𝑗1),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥ln𝑖𝑗1)],[Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥ln𝑖𝑗2),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥ln𝑖𝑗2)],[Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥ln𝑖𝑗3),Lim⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(𝑥ln𝑖𝑗3)],ℎ𝑙𝑥̃ 𝑛𝑖𝑗)}⟩.
(27)
It is further translated into an interval type-2 fuzzy rough number, which is defined as the average of the sequence.

IT2FRN(𝑥̃ ̃ 𝑖𝑗)={([𝑥𝑢𝐿𝑖𝑗1,𝑥𝑢𝑈𝑖𝑗1],[𝑥𝑢𝐿𝑖𝑗2,𝑥𝑢𝑈𝑖𝑗2],[𝑥𝑢𝐿𝑖𝑗3,𝑥𝑢𝑈𝑖𝑗3],ℎ𝑢𝑥̃ 𝑖𝑗),([𝑥𝑙𝐿𝑖𝑗1,𝑥𝑙𝑈𝑖𝑗1],[𝑥𝑙𝐿𝑖𝑗2,𝑥𝑙𝑈𝑖𝑗2],[𝑥𝑙𝐿𝑖𝑗3,𝑥𝑙𝑈𝑖𝑗3],ℎ𝑙𝑥̃ 𝑖𝑗)}

where

(30)
Then, an interval type-2 fuzzy rough pairwise comparison matrix can be obtained as Eq. (31):

𝑀̂ ̂ =⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢{([1,1],[1,1],[1,1];ℎ𝑢𝑥̃ 11),([1,1],[1,1],[1,1];ℎ𝑙𝑥̃ 11)}⋯⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪([𝑥𝑢𝐿𝑝11,𝑥𝑢𝑈𝑝11],[𝑥𝑢𝐿𝑝12,𝑥𝑢𝑈𝑝12],[𝑥𝑢𝐿𝑝13,𝑥𝑢𝑈𝑝13],ℎ𝑢𝑥̃ 𝑝1),([𝑥𝑙𝐿𝑝11,𝑥𝑙𝑈𝑝11],[𝑥𝑙𝐿𝑝12,𝑥𝑙𝑈𝑝12],[𝑥𝑙𝐿𝑝13,𝑥𝑙𝑈𝑝13],ℎ𝑙𝑥̃ 𝑝1)⎫⎭⎬⎪⎪⋯⋯⋯⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪([𝑥𝑢𝐿1𝑝1,𝑥𝑢𝑈1𝑝1],[𝑥𝑢𝐿1𝑝2,𝑥𝑢𝑈1𝑝2],[𝑥𝑢𝐿1𝑝3,𝑥𝑢𝑈1𝑝3],ℎ𝑢𝑥̃ 1𝑝),([𝑥𝑙𝐿1𝑝1,𝑥𝑙𝑈1𝑝1],[𝑥𝑙𝐿1𝑝2,𝑥𝑙𝑈1𝑝2],[𝑥𝑙𝐿1𝑝3,𝑥𝑙𝑈1𝑝3],ℎ𝑙𝑥̃ 1𝑝)⎫⎭⎬⎪⎪⋯{([1,1],[1,1],[1,1];ℎ𝑢𝑥̃ 𝑝𝑝),([1,1],[1,1],[1,1];ℎ𝑙𝑥̃ 𝑝𝑝)}⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥

Step 3 Indicator weights calculation.

Based on the interval type-2 fuzzy rough pairwise comparison matrix 𝑀̂ ̂ , the interval type-2 fuzzy rough weight for each evaluation indicator is calculated as:

𝑤̂ 𝑖={([𝑤𝑢𝐿𝑖1,𝑤𝑢𝑈𝑖1],[𝑤𝑢𝐿𝑖2,𝑤𝑢𝑈𝑖2],[𝑤𝑢𝐿𝑖1,𝑤𝑢𝑈𝑖1],ℎ𝑢𝑤̂ 𝑖),([𝑤𝑙𝐿𝑖1,𝑤𝑙𝑈𝑖1],[𝑤𝑙𝐿𝑖2,𝑤𝑙𝑈𝑖2],[𝑤𝑙𝐿𝑖1,𝑤𝑙𝑈𝑖1],ℎ𝑙𝑤̂ 𝑖)}=⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪⎛⎝⎜⎜⎜⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢∏𝑗=1𝑝𝑥𝑢𝐿𝑖𝑗1‾‾‾‾‾‾‾⎷𝑝,∏𝑗=1𝑝𝑥𝑢𝑈𝑖𝑗1‾‾‾‾‾‾‾⎷𝑝⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥,⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢∏𝑗=1𝑝𝑥𝑢𝐿𝑖𝑗2‾‾‾‾‾‾‾⎷𝑝,∏𝑗=1𝑝𝑥𝑢𝑈𝑖𝑗2‾‾‾‾‾‾‾⎷𝑝⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥,∏𝑗=1𝑝𝑥𝑢𝐿𝑖𝑗3‾‾‾‾‾‾‾⎷𝑝,∏𝑗=1𝑝𝑥𝑢𝑈𝑖𝑗3‾‾‾‾‾‾‾⎷𝑝,min(ℎ𝑢𝑥̃ 𝑖1,ℎ𝑢𝑥̃ 𝑖1,…,ℎ𝑢𝑥̃ 𝑖𝑝)⎞⎠⎟⎟⎟,⎛⎝⎜⎜⎜⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢∏𝑗=1𝑝𝑥𝑙𝐿𝑖𝑗1‾‾‾‾‾‾‾⎷𝑝,∏𝑗=1𝑝𝑥𝑙𝑈𝑖𝑗1‾‾‾‾‾‾‾⎷𝑝⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥,⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢∏𝑗=1𝑝𝑥𝑙𝐿𝑖𝑗2‾‾‾‾‾‾‾⎷𝑝,∏𝑗=1𝑝𝑥𝑙𝑈𝑖𝑗2‾‾‾‾‾‾‾⎷𝑝⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥,∏𝑗=1𝑝𝑥𝑙𝐿𝑖𝑗3‾‾‾‾‾‾‾⎷𝑝,∏𝑗=1𝑝𝑥𝑙𝑈𝑖𝑗3‾‾‾‾‾‾‾⎷𝑝,min(ℎ𝑙𝑥̃ 𝑖1,ℎ𝑙𝑥̃ 𝑖1,…,ℎ𝑙𝑥̃ 𝑖𝑝)⎞⎠⎟⎟⎟⎫⎭⎬⎪⎪.
(32)
It can be further normalized as:

𝑤̂ ′𝑖=𝑤̂ 𝑖/max(𝑤𝑢𝑈𝑖3).
(33)
Thus, the indicator weights are determined.

Step 4 Acquire the crisp weight of each indicator based on the deroughness and defuzzification model.

To facilitate subsequent calculations, it is necessary to obtain the crisp value wi from the determined interval type-2 fuzzy rough weight of each indicator, which includes two steps: deroughness and defuzzification. The detailed steps for them can be referred to the research of Song and Cao [51] and Kahraman et al. [50], respectively.

The extended MABAC method for curtain grouting efficiency assessment
Variable weight theory
The variable weight idea was first introduced by Wang [44], and the variable weight theory was further developed by Zhang and Li [52]. The definitions for variable weights are as follows:

Definition 1:
The constant weight vector is 𝑊0=(𝑤01,𝑤02,…,𝑤0𝑝)∈(0,1]𝑝 and ∑𝑝𝑖=1𝑤0𝑖=1.

Definition 2:
There is a set of p-ary mappings: 𝑊𝑣:[0,1]𝑝→(0,1]𝑝, 𝑋(𝑥1,𝑥2,…,𝑥𝑝)→𝑊𝑣(𝑋), the vector 𝑊𝑣(𝑋)=(𝑤𝑣1(𝑋),𝑤𝑣2(𝑋),…,𝑤𝑣𝑝(𝑋)) is a variable weight vector and satisfied the following conditions: (1) Normality: ∑𝑝𝑖=1𝑤𝑣𝑖(𝑥1,𝑥2,…,𝑥𝑝)=1; (2) Continuity: 𝑤𝑣𝑖(𝑖=1,2,…,𝑝) is continuous in p-dimensional space; (3) Penalty: 𝑤𝑣𝑖(𝑖=1,2,…,𝑝) is monotonically decreasing with respect to 𝑥𝑖(𝑖=1,2,…,𝑝); (4) Reward: 𝑤𝑣𝑖(𝑖=1,2,…,𝑝) is monotonically increasing with respect to 𝑥𝑖(𝑖=1,2,…,𝑝). If Wv(X) meets the conditions (1), (2) and (3), Wv(X) is a penalty variable weight vector; while meeting conditions (1), (2) and (4), Wv(X) is a reward variable weight vector.

Definition 3:
Given a mapping: 𝑆:[0,1]𝑝→(0,+∞)𝑝, 𝑋(𝑥1,𝑥2,…,𝑥𝑝)→𝑆(𝑋), where 𝑆(𝑋)=(𝑆1(𝑋),𝑆2(𝑋),…,𝑆𝑝(𝑋)) is a p-dimensional state variable weight vector and satisfies the following axioms: (1) 𝑥𝑎≥𝑥𝑏→𝑆𝑎(𝑋)≤𝑆𝑏(𝑋); (2) 𝑥𝑎≥𝑥𝑏→𝑆𝑎(𝑋)≥𝑆𝑏(𝑋); (3) 𝑆𝑖(𝑥1,𝑥2,…,𝑥𝑝) is continuous with respect to 𝑥𝑖(𝑖=1,2,…,𝑝).

Then, the variable weight vector Wv(X) can be computed by the Hadamard product of the constant weight vector W0 and the state variable weight vector S(X).

If Wv(X) meets conditions (1), (2) and (3) in Definition 2, and S(X) satisfies axioms (1) and (3) in Definition 3, S(X) is called as a penalty state variable weight vector. Otherwise, S(X) is called as a reward state variable weight vector.

The extended MABAC method
After obtaining the weight of indicators, the MABAC method is used to evaluate the grouting efficiency. The intent of the MABAC method is to make the evaluation results as precise and rational as possible by computing the relative strengths and weaknesses with respect to each evaluation indicator. Nevertheless, the indicator weight obtained by the above interval type-2 fuzzy rough AHP method is a constant weight, which can well consider the relative importance of each evaluation indicator but fails to reflect the influence of the change in the indicator value on the evaluation results. Therefore, to make the evaluation results consistent with the actual situation, an extended MABAC method based on variable weight theory is proposed in this study, in which variable weight theory is used to adjust indicator weight. The application procedures of variable weight theory-based MABAC are illustrated in Fig. 5, and the detailed explanations are as follows:

Step 1 Construction of the initial evaluation matrix

𝑋=𝐴1𝐴2⋯𝐴𝑛⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢𝑥11𝑥21⋯𝑥𝑛1𝑥12𝑥22⋯𝑥𝑛2…⋯⋱⋯𝑥1𝑝𝑥2𝑝⋯𝑥𝑛𝑝⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥𝐼1𝐼2⋯𝐼𝑝
(34)
where xij is the value of j-th indicator Ij for the i-th alternative Ai (i = 1, 2, …, n, j = 1, 2, …, p).

Step 2 Normalize the elements of the initial evaluation matrix (X).

Due to the different dimensions and units of indicators, it is necessary to normalize the initial evaluation matrix to make all the elements dimensionless and comparable, and the following equations are used for normalization.

For benefit indicator:

𝑛𝑖𝑗=𝑥𝑖𝑗−min𝑖(𝑥𝑖𝑗)max𝑖(𝑥𝑖𝑗)−min𝑖(𝑥𝑖𝑗)
(35)
For cost indicator:

𝑛𝑖𝑗=max𝑖(𝑥𝑖𝑗)−𝑥𝑖𝑗max𝑖(𝑥𝑖𝑗)−min𝑖(𝑥𝑖𝑗).
(36)
Then, the normalized matrix can be obtained as:

𝑁=𝐴1𝐴2⋯𝐴𝑛⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢𝑛11𝑛21⋯𝑛𝑛1𝑛12𝑛22⋯𝑛𝑛2…⋯⋱⋯𝑛1𝑝𝑛2𝑝⋯𝑛𝑛𝑝⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥𝐼1𝐼2⋯𝐼𝑝.
(37)
Step 3 Develop the weighted decision-making matrix based on variable weight:

For the evaluation of grouting efficiency, a single indicator with a poor evaluation level may significantly reduce the overall situation of grouting efficiency, but a higher indicator may not necessarily improve the comprehensive condition of grouting efficiency. Therefore, the penalty state variable weight vector is used to reflect and amplify the impact of bad indicators on the final evaluation results to better avoid the risks. An exponential state variable weight vector that is scientific, flexible and operable is constructed in this study as follows:

𝑆𝑗(𝑋)={𝑒𝛼(𝛽𝑗−𝑥∗𝑗),𝑥∗𝑗≤𝛽𝑗1,𝑥∗𝑗>𝛽𝑗
(38)
where α is the weight change strength and α > 0; the larger α is, the larger the change in weight will be. 𝑥∗𝑗 is the normalized value of the j-th indicator obtained in Step 2, and βj is the variable weight threshold value of the j-th indicator. The value of these parameters is determined according to the actual situation of each indicator.

Then, based on the relative weight wj and state variable weight vector Sj, the variable weight wjv of the j-th indicator can be obtained by Eq. (39),

𝑊𝑣(𝑋)=𝑊0𝑆(𝑋)∑𝑝𝑗=1(𝑤0𝑗𝑆𝑗(𝑋))
(39)
where 𝑊0𝑆(𝑋)=(𝑤01𝑆1(𝑋),𝑤02𝑆2(𝑋),…,𝑤0𝑝𝑆𝑝(𝑋)) is the Hadamard product. Then, the variable weight decision matrix is as follows:

𝑉=⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢𝑣11𝑣21⋯𝑣𝑛1𝑣12𝑣22⋯𝑣𝑛2…⋯⋱⋯𝑣1𝑝𝑛2𝑝⋯𝑛𝑛𝑝⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥=⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢𝑤𝑣1(𝑛11+1)𝑤𝑣1(𝑛21+1)⋯𝑤𝑣1(𝑛𝑛1+1)𝑤𝑣2(𝑛12+1)𝑤𝑣2(𝑛22+1)⋯𝑤𝑣2(𝑛𝑛2+1)…⋯⋱⋯𝑤𝑣𝑝(𝑛1𝑝+1)𝑤𝑣𝑝(𝑛2𝑝+1)⋯𝑤𝑣𝑝(𝑛𝑛𝑝+1)⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥.
(40)
Step 4 Calculate the border approximation area matrix.

The border approximation area (BAA) for each indicator is determined according to the following equation:

𝑔𝑗=(∏𝑖=1𝑛𝑣𝑖𝑗)1𝑛
(41)
where vij is the element of weighted decision-making matrix V. Then, we can obtain the border approximation area matrix G as:

𝐺=[𝑔1𝑔2⋯𝑔𝑝]𝐼1𝐼2⋯𝐼𝑝.
(42)
Step 5 Obtain the distance of each alternative from the BAA.

The distance matrix Q is calculated by:

𝑄====𝑉−𝐺⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢𝑣11𝑣21⋯𝑣𝑛1𝑣12𝑣22⋯𝑣𝑛2…⋯⋱⋯𝑣1𝑝𝑛2𝑝⋯𝑛𝑛𝑝⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥−⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢𝑔1𝑔1⋯𝑔1𝑔2𝑔2⋯𝑔2…⋯⋱⋯𝑔𝑝𝑔𝑝⋯𝑔𝑝⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢𝑣11−𝑔1𝑣21−𝑔1⋯𝑣𝑛1−𝑔1𝑣12−𝑔2𝑣22−𝑔2⋯𝑣𝑛2−𝑔2…⋯⋱⋯𝑣1𝑝−𝑔𝑝𝑣2𝑝−𝑔𝑝⋯𝑛𝑛𝑝−𝑔𝑝⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢𝑞11𝑞21⋯𝑞𝑛1𝑞12𝑞22⋯𝑞𝑛2…⋯⋱⋯𝑞1𝑝𝑞2𝑝⋯𝑞𝑛𝑝⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥.
(43)
The alternative Ai can belong to the upper approximation area (G+), the border approximation area (G) or the lower approximation area (G+); that is, the ideal alternative A+ is contained in the area of G+, and the anti-ideal alternative A− is contained in the area of G− (Fig. 6), which is determined on the basis of the following equation:

𝐴𝑖∈⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪𝐺+,if𝑞𝑖𝑗>0𝐺,if𝑞𝑖𝑗=0𝐺−,if𝑞𝑖𝑗<0.
(44)

Step 6 Calculate the final evaluating score.

The final evaluation score of each alternative is obtained by summing the elements of matrix Q by rows as follows, the larger the value of Ei is, the better the alternative.

𝐸𝑖=∑𝑗=1𝑝𝑞𝑖𝑗,𝑖=1,2,…,𝑛;𝑗=1,2,…,𝑝
(45)
where p is the number of indicators and n is the number of alternatives.

Case study and results
Project description and indicator data collection
The proposed comprehensive evaluation method is applied to the curtain grouting efficiency assessment of a hydropower station located on the upper reaches of the Lancang River in Yunnan Province. The installed capacity of the hydropower station is 1400 MW, the maximum dam height is 139.80 m, and the total length of the dam crest is 576.68 m. We selected 3 grouting units (units 36, 37, 38) from the numerous grouting units in this project as the study area to evaluate the grouting efficiency, as shown in Fig. 7. There are 7 verification boreholes in these three grouting units (Fig. 7b), which include 98 tested intervals. The longitudinal layout of the verification boreholes is shown in Fig. 7c.

Based on the original test data of the water pressure test (WPT), core specimen drilling, borehole television imaging and acoustic wave test obtained from the grouting project site, the values of evaluation indicators LU, RQD, FFR and V for each verification borehole can be calculated using the methods mentioned in Sect. 2.3.1, as shown in Fig. 8. The value range of the indicator LU is 0–10 Lu, the value range of the indicator RQD is 3.79–90%, the value range of the indicator FFR is 0–100%, and the value range of the indicator V is 4.12–6.02 km/s.

According to the actual conditions of grouting engineering, in general, the grouting efficiency is classified into five levels [9]: I (good), II (fine), III (ordinary), IV (poor) and V (bad). To effectively assess the grouting efficiency, the evaluation indicators are also classified into five corresponding levels, which are shown in Table 3. LU is the cost indicator (a lower value of the indicator is preferable), and RQD, FFR and V are the benefit indicators (a higher value of the indicator is preferable).

Determining the weights of evaluation indicators
The interval type-2 fuzzy rough AHP is adopted to determine the weights of evaluation indicators LU, RQD, FFR and V.

Step 1 Collect the judgments of decision makers and construct the integrated interval type-2 fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix.

To determine the weight of each evaluation indicator, six experts from the industry were invited to judge the relative importance of the evaluation indicators based on their own engineering experience and professional knowledge, and all of them had more than eight years of academic experience or working experience in grouting engineering and dam foundation construction. These experts are designated as DM1–DM6, and their linguistic pairwise comparison judgments of the evaluation criteria layer and indicator layer, according to the hierarchical evaluation indicator system (Fig. 2), are shown in Tables 4, 5 and 6.

It can be seen from Table 2 that there is always complete consistency for the first-order matrix and the second-order matrix, so the above six second-order matrices are acceptable.

Obviously, the consistency in all the interval type-2 fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices is acceptable because the consistency ratios CRe (e = 1, 2, …, 6) are all smaller than 0.1.

Then, corresponding to Eq. (25), three integrated pairwise comparison matrices 𝑀̃ ̃ 𝑂, 𝑀̃ ̃ 𝐶1 and 𝑀̃ ̃ 𝐶2 are constructed as follows:

𝑀̃ ̃ 𝑂=[12̃ ̃ −1,3̃ ̃ −1,2̃ ̃ −1,2̃ ̃ −1,2̃ ̃ −1,4̃ ̃ −12̃ ̃ ,3̃ ̃ ,2̃ ̃ ,2̃ ̃ ,2̃ ̃ ,4̃ ̃ 1]

(51)
Step 2 Convert the elements in 𝑀̃ ̃ 𝑂, 𝑀̃ ̃ 𝐶1 and 𝑀̃ ̃ 𝐶2 to interval type-2 fuzzy rough numbers and construct interval type-2 fuzzy rough pairwise comparison matrices.

Take the element 𝑥̃ ̃ 12={2̃ ̃ ,3̃ ̃ ,2̃ ̃ ,2̃ ̃ ,2̃ ̃ ,4̃ ̃ } in 𝑀̃ ̃ 𝑂 as an example, according to the interval type-2 fuzzy scales defined in Table 1:

𝑥̃ ̃ 112=𝑥̃ ̃ 312=𝑥̃ ̃ 412=𝑥̃ ̃ 512=2̃ ̃ =((1,2,3;1),(1.5,2,2.5;0.9)),𝑥̃ ̃ 212=3̃ ̃ =((2,3,4;1),(2.5,3,3.5;0.9)),𝑥̃ ̃ 612=4̃ ̃ =((3,4,5;1),(3.5,4,4.5;0.9))
(52)
Based on Eqs. (8)–(15):

𝐿𝑖𝑚⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(2𝑢1)=14(1+1+1+1)=1,𝐿𝑖𝑚⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(2𝑢1)=16(1+1+1+1+2+3)=1.5𝐿𝑖𝑚⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(2𝑢2)=14(2+2+2+2)=2,𝐿𝑖𝑚⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(2𝑢2)=16(2+2+2+2+3+4)=2.5𝐿𝑖𝑚⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(2𝑢3)=14(3+3+3+3)=3,𝐿𝑖𝑚⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(2𝑢3)=16(3+3+3+3+4+5)=3.5𝐿𝑖𝑚⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(2𝑙1)=14(1.5+1.5+1.5+1.5)=1.5,𝐿𝑖𝑚⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(2𝑙1)=16(1.5+1.5+1.5+1.5+2.5+3.5)=2𝐿𝑖𝑚⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(2𝑙2)=14(2+2+2+2)=2,𝐿𝑖𝑚⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(2𝑙2)=16(2+2+2+2+3+4)=2.5𝐿𝑖𝑚⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(2𝑙3)=14(2.5+2.5+2.5+2.5)=2.5,𝐿𝑖𝑚⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯(2𝑙3)=16(2.5+2.5+2.5+2.5+3.5+4.5)=3.
(53)
Therefore, the 𝑥̃ ̃ 112, 𝑥̃ ̃ 312, 𝑥̃ ̃ 412 and 𝑥̃ ̃ 512 can be converted into interval type-2 fuzzy rough number by Eq. (16):

𝐼𝑇2𝐹𝑅𝑁(𝑥̃ ̃ 112)=={([1,1.5],[2,2.5],[3,3.5];1),([1.5,2],[2,2.5],[2.5,3];0.9)}.𝐼𝑇2𝐹𝑅𝑁(𝑥̃ ̃ 312)=𝐼𝑇2𝐹𝑅𝑁(𝑥̃ ̃ 412)=𝐼𝑇2𝐹𝑅𝑁(𝑥̃ ̃ 512)
(54)
Similarly, the 𝑥̃ ̃ 212 and 𝑥̃ ̃ 612 can be obtained as:

IT2FRN(𝑥̃ ̃ 212)={([1.2,2.5],[2.2,3.5],[3.2,4.5];1),([1.7,3],[2.2,3.5],[2.7,4];0.9)}
(55)
IT2FRN(𝑥̃ ̃ 612)={([1.5,3],[2.5,4],[3.5,5];1),([2,3.5],[2.5,4],[3,4.5];0.9)}.
(56)
Then, the element 𝑥̃ ̃ 12 in 𝑀̃ ̃ 𝑂 can be transformed using Eq. (28):

IT2FRN(𝑥̃ ̃ 612)={([1.12,1.92],[2.12,2.92],[3.12,3.92];1),([1.62,2.42],[2.12,2.92],[2.62,3.42];0.9)}
(57)
and other elements in 𝑀̃ ̃ 𝑂 performed the same transformation. Then, an interval type-2 fuzzy rough pairwise comparison matrix 𝑀̂ ̂ 𝑂 can be constructed, and interval type-2 fuzzy rough pairwise comparison matrices 𝑀̂ ̂ 𝐶1 and 𝑀̂ ̂ 𝐶2 can be generated in the same way, as follows:

𝑀̂ ̂ 𝑂=⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢{([1,1],[1,1],[1,1];1),([1,1],[1,1],[1,1];0.9)}{([0.27,0.32],[0.38,0.48],[0.66,0.95];1),([0.31,0.39],[0.38,0.48],[0.48,0.64];0.9)}{([1.12,1.92],[2.12,2.92],[3.12,3.92];1),([1.62,2.42],[2.12,2.92],[2.62,3.42];0.9)}{([1,1],[1,1],[1,1];1),([1,1],[1,1],[1,1];0.9)}⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥

Step 3 Indicator weights calculation.

Based on the interval type-2 fuzzy rough pairwise comparison matrix 𝑀̂ ̂ 𝑂, 𝑀̂ ̂ 𝐶1 and 𝑀̂ ̂ 𝐶2, the relative weights of permeability criteria and tightness criteria with respect to the objective layer (comprehensive evaluation of curtain grouting), the relative weights of evaluation indicators with respect to the permeability criteria and the relative weights of the evaluation indicators with respect to the tightness criteria can be determined by Eq. (32) and is shown in Table 7.

Finally, the weights of evaluation indicators LU, RQD, FFR and V can be obtained as:

Then, they will be further normalized and are given in Table 8.

Step 4 Acquire the crisp weight of each indicator.

Based on the interval type-2 fuzzy rough form of evaluation indicator weights, the normalized crisp weight value is thus obtained by using the deroughness and defuzzification model, as shown in Table 8:

Comprehensive evaluation of curtain grouting efficiency
Based on the indicator weights determined by the interval type-2 fuzzy rough AHP, an extended MABAC method based on variable weight theory is developed to comprehensively evaluate the curtain grouting efficiency of 98 tested intervals of 7 verification boreholes.

Step 1 Formation of the initial evaluation matrix.

According to Fig. 8, the initial indicator values of each tested interval of each verification borehole are shown in Table 9, which mainly takes the 14 tested intervals of verification borehole 7 as an example, and only a part of the indicators for other tested intervals is listed. In addition, to classify the grouting efficiency of these tested intervals into certain levels, the samples with known efficiency levels are given according to the efficiency level standards of indicators in Table 3. The samples whose indicator values are the critical values between levels I, II, III, IV and V are set as C1, C2, C3 and C4, respectively, as shown in Table 9.

Table 9 The initial evaluation matrix and its normalization
Full size table
Step 2 Normalize the elements of the initial evaluation matrix.

By using Eqs. (35)–(36), the normalized elements of the initial evaluation matrix can be obtained as shown in Table 9.

Step 3 Develop the weighted evaluation matrix based on variable weight.

According to the actual situation of the grouting site, and the analysis of the value in the normalized evaluation matrix, the weight change strength α was set to 0.5, and the variable weight threshold value βj was set as the cutoff value between levels IV and V. Specifically, the variable weight threshold value of the indicators LU, RQD, FFR and V were 0.800, 0.246, 0.250 and 0.254, respectively. Then, the indicator weights can be adjusted by the variable weight theory, taking tested interval I714 as an example: since the normalized value of LU is 0.13, which is smaller than the variable weight threshold value βLU = 0.80, the state variable weight vector SLU = e0.5*(0.80–0.13) = 1.398. Similarly, we can obtain the state variable weight vectors of the other three indicators, that is, SRQD = SFFR = SV = 1. Finally, the variable weights of the evaluation indicators are calculated as 𝑤𝑣LU=0.439×1.3980.439×1.398+0.277×1+0.137×1+0.147×1=0.522, 𝑤𝑣RQD=0.277×10.439×1.398+0.277×1+0.137×1+0.147×1=0.236, 𝑤𝑣FFR=0.137×10.439×1.398+0.277×1+0.137×1+0.147×1=0.117, and 𝑤𝑣FFR=0.147×10.439×1.398+0.277×1+0.137×1+0.147×1=0.125. Analogously, the indicator variable weights of other tested intervals are also obtained.

The weighted evaluation matrix thus can be calculated by Eq. (40), as shown in Table 10.

Step 4 Establish the border approximation area matrix.

The BAA matrix for each indicator is calculated by Eq. (41), which is shown in Table 11:

Table 11 BAA matrix

Step 5 Calculate the distance of each tested interval from the BAA matrix.

The distance of each tested interval to be evaluated from the BAA matrix is calculated by Eq. (43), which is shown in Table 12.

Table 12 Distance of each tested interval to be evaluated from the BAA matrix
Full size table
Step 6 Calculate the final evaluating score and evaluate each tested interval.

The final evaluation score of each tested interval in verification borehole 7 can be calculated by Eq. (45): C1 = 0.376, C2 = 0.243, C3 = 0.056, C4 = −0.106, E1 = 0.095, E2 = 0.187, E3 = 0.206, E4 = 0.177, E5 = 0.248, E6 = 0.305, E7 = 0.138, E8 = −0.023, E9 = −0.044, E10 = −0.178, E11 = 0.009, E12 = 0.004, E13 = −0.260, E14 = −0.241. Therefore, C1 > E6 > E5 > C2 > E3 > E2 > E4 > E7 > E1 > C3 > E11 > E12 > E8 > E9 > C4 > E10 > E14 > E13. First, this indicated that the rank of grouting efficiency level is C1 > C2 > C3 > C4 for the samples whose indicator values are the critical values between levels I, II, III, IV and V, which is consistent with the actual situations and shows that the evaluation results obtained by the proposed method are reasonable; then, the rank of final evaluating scores indicated the grouting efficiency of I76 and I75 belong to level II (fine); I73, I72, I74, I77 and I71 belong to level III (ordinary); I711, I712, I78 and I79 belong to level IV (poor); and I710, I714 and I713 belong to level V (bad). The classification of the grouting efficiency level shows that only two tested intervals in verification borehole 7 are at the “fine” level, and the evaluation results of most tested intervals are “poor” and “bad.” Thus, reinforcement grouting is required for the tested intervals in which the grouting efficiency does not meet the engineering requirements.

The final evaluation scores of the tested intervals in the other six verification boreholes are obtained in the same way, as depicted in Fig. 9a, and the overall grouting efficiency of the verification borehole is expressed by the proportion of each efficiency level in the borehole, as shown in Fig. 9b. The grouting efficiency of these verification boreholes is not optimistic; only a few of the tested intervals belong to level II (fine), and the grouting efficiency of most tested intervals are poor or even bad. Therefore, reinforcement grouting should be taken for all these areas, especially for the tested intervals belonging to levels IV and V.

Comparison and discussion
To demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed comprehensive evaluation model, several comparisons are conducted with the results of other related methods, and some in-depth discussions are carried out in this section. In addition, some practical implications are illustrated.

Advantage comparison of the proposed method
In this section, the superiority of the proposed interval type-2 fuzzy rough number and the effectiveness of using variable weight theory are verified by comparing the results with other relevant methods.

Comparisons of the uncertainty manipulation mechanism of group judgments
The first comparison focuses on exploring the differences between the indicator weights obtained under the crisp AHP [53], rough AHP [54], fuzzy AHP [55], interval type-2 fuzzy AHP [14], and the proposed interval type-2 fuzzy rough AHP, which are shown in Fig. 10. The same linguistic judgments from the expert group are inputted into these five methods by converting them to crisp numbers, rough numbers, triangular fuzzy numbers, triangular interval type-2 fuzzy numbers and interval type-2 fuzzy rough numbers. In the crisp AHP, the arithmetic averaging operator is adopted to aggregate the crisp judgments of 6 experts. In the rough AHP, rough numbers are obtained by integrating the group crisp judgments using the arithmetical operation of the rough set approach. For the fuzzy AHP and interval type-2 fuzzy AHP, the aggregation of group judgments is acquired by calculating the arithmetical means of the corresponding triangular fuzzy numbers and triangular interval type-2 fuzzy numbers for the linguistic judgments. From Fig. 10a, all five methods determine the relative weights of evaluation indicators with identical orders (V < FFR < RQD < LU), but the sizes are different. For instance, the weight of the indicator LU obtained by the crisp AHP method is the largest among the five methods, but the obtained weights of the indicators FFR and RQD are the smallest among the five methods; the weight of the indicator LU obtained by the fuzzy AHP method is the smallest among the five methods, but the obtained weights of the indicators RQD, FFR and RQD are the largest among the five methods, while the indicator weights determined by the interval type-2 fuzzy rough AHP are almost in the middle position. The weight differences among these five methods are mainly derived from the different manipulation mechanisms of the judgment uncertainties, including intrapersonal and interpersonal uncertainties. Both the crisp AHP and rough AHP calculate the indicator weights using the crisp number, that is, they express experts’ judgments by an exact value, which is not suitable for the actual situation, and fail to reveal the uncertainty of the group decision-making environment. Although rough numbers can be used to objectively aggregate decision-making information, the inaccuracy caused by crisp numbers cannot be avoided. In contrast, the fuzzy AHP method can effectively address the imprecise and ambiguous nature of human judgment, and the interval type-2 fuzzy AHP is more appropriate in terms of tackling uncertainties related to linguistic terms and addressing higher uncertainties; however, they ignored group uncertainty and diversity. By integrating the merits of interval type-2 fuzzy numbers and rough numbers, the proposed interval type-2 fuzzy rough AHP enables us to obtain more realistic indicator weights under the environment of intrapersonal and interpersonal uncertainties.

To further illustrate the difference in the uncertainty manipulation mechanisms between the above five methods, the group linguistic judgments {MP, SI, SP, MI, MI, WI} on the relative importance of indicator RQD to indicator LU with respect to the tightness criteria are taken as an example. As shown in Fig. 11, the corresponding crisp numbers are 4, 5, 6, 3, 3, 2; the rough numbers are [3.00, 5.00], [3.40, 5.50], [3.83, 6.00], [2.67, 4.20], [2.67, 4.20], [2.00, 3.83]; the fuzzy numbers are [3.5, 4.5], [4.5, 5.5], [5.5, 6.5], [2.5, 3.5], [2.5, 3.5], [1.5, 2.5]; the interval type-2 fuzzy numbers are [(3.0, 3.5), (4.5, 5.0)], [(4.0, 4.5), (5.5, 6.0)], [(5.0, 5.5), (6.5, 7.0)], [(2.0, 2.5), (3.5,4.0)], [(2.0, 2.5), (3.5,4.0)], [(1.0, 1.5), (2.5, 3.0)]; and the interval type-2 fuzzy rough numbers are [(2.00, 2.50), (5.50, 6.00)], [(2.40, 2.90), (6.00, 6.50)], [(2.83, 3.33), (6.50, 7.00)], [(1.67, 2,17), (4.70, 5.20)], [(1.67, 2,17), (4.70, 5.20)], [(1.00, 1.50), (4.33, 4.83)]. According to Fig. 11, the upper and lower boundaries of all the rough numbers and fuzzy numbers are single numbers, which may cause information loss and uncertainty expression deviation; while the interval type-2 fuzzy numbers have interval boundaries, which can better handle and express more uncertainties, but the range of interval type-2 fuzzy numbers and fuzzy numbers are fixed because they can only deal with the individual vagueness of the experts and ignore the effects of other experts’ judgments, so that they cannot flexibly reflect the actual group decision-making situation; the rough intervals are variable because rough number theory can manipulate the group uncertainty, however, it uses deterministic values to express the initial judgments of experts, which failed to consider intrapersonal uncertainty of experts; in contrast, the interval type-2 fuzzy rough numbers have flexible boundaries and variable ranges, which are capable of depicting the uncertainty inherent in individual judgment and handling the group preference diversity. Other kinds of numbers are fully contained in the corresponding range of interval type-2 fuzzy rough numbers, which indicates that it integrates the advantages of interval type-2 fuzzy numbers and rough numbers to handle a variety of uncertainties. Therefore, the proposed interval type-2 fuzzy rough number has a more powerful uncertainty manipulation mechanism, which can effectively manipulate intrapersonal and interpersonal uncertainties simultaneously to reveal the experts’ actual perceptions in group decision making.

Effectiveness verification of the variable weight theory
In this section, taking the indicator data of verification borehole 2 as an example, the constant weights of the indicators calculated by the interval type-2 fuzzy rough AHP method are compared with the indicator variable weights, which are the constant weights adjusted by variable weight theory (Fig. 12). The constant weight and variable weight of the four evaluation indicators of each tested interval are shown in Fig. 12a. Except for tested intervals 2, 4, 5 and 6, the variable weights of the evaluation indicators in the other tested intervals all changed compared to their constant weights. The indicators with variable weights higher than constant weight are those whose normalized values are lower than their threshold values, which indicates that the variable weight can accurately reflect the abnormality of the indicator value, and the weight can be adjusted according to the change in each indicator value. For instance, in tested interval 12, the normalized value of the LU indicator is far lower than the threshold value, so the variable weight increases a lot. At the same time, the variable weight of the FFR indicator is less than the constant weight, although the normalized value of the FFR indicator is also lower than its threshold value, this is due to the fact that the normalized value of the indicator is relatively close to the threshold and the adjustment of the weight of each indicator should take into account the changes in the weight of other indicators. Furthermore, we evaluate the grouting efficiency of each tested interval based on variable weights and constant weights, and the results are shown in Fig. 12b. In addition to the tested intervals with the same variable weight and constant weight, for other tested intervals, the final evaluating score Ei based on variable weight is reduced to varying degrees compared to the Ei based on the constant weight. Moreover, the grouting efficiency level of tested interval 8 also changes accordingly (level III becomes level IV). Therefore, in the process of grouting efficiency evaluation, variable weight theory can highlight the influence of poor indicator values on the evaluation result by adjusting the weight of indicators whose normalized value is lower than the threshold value, to avoid the neutralization effect existing in the weighted calculation that leads to the inconsistency of the evaluation result with actual reality. In addition, the weight adjusted by the variable weight theory can integrate the knowledge and experience of experts with the actual information reflected by the measured indicator data so that the evaluation objects actively participate in the whole evaluation process in the evaluation model to obtain more objective and reasonable evaluation results. In addition, the grouting efficiency level results may not have obvious changes after taking variable weights, even so, neglecting the impact of poor indicator values may cause the evaluation results to be inconsistent with the actual situation.

Comparative analysis of the results among different evaluation methods
In terms of evaluation methods, the proposed evaluation method is compared with the results of different evaluation methods, such as the TOPSIS method [55] and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method [9], which all use the same indicator weights. In addition, it is also compared with the single-factor method (i.e., WPT) [47], which is often used in grouting engineering. Under the above four methods, the grouting efficiency level evaluation results of seven verification boreholes are shown in Fig. 13. It can be seen that for the proposed evaluation method, 80.6% (79/98) of the results are consistent with the results of the TOPSIS method, 61.2% (60/98) of the results are the same as those of the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, and 30.6% (30/98) of the results are the same as those of the single-factor method. These differences can be explained by the comparative analysis on the evaluation process of the above evaluation methods. First, as distance-based MCDM methods, the MABAC method has a well-structured analysis framework compared with the TOPSIS method to ensure the stability of the evaluation results. Second, in the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, the calculation of indicator membership degrees is easily affected by the individual experience, and the score of the grouting efficiency level is preset before the evaluation (the scores of level I, II, III, IV and V are 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1), which will lead to subjectivity and uncertainty in the evaluation results. In contrast, the proposed evaluation method is completely based on the data itself for evaluation analysis. Compared with the equidistant efficiency level classification adopted by the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, the proposed method can provide a more reasonable and more realistic evaluation. Third, the proposed evaluation method comprehensively considers multiple indicators that reflect the permeability and tightness of the rock mass to evaluate the grouting efficiency, which can fully reflect the actual grouting efficiency and avoid the one-sidedness caused by the single-factor method that only considers the LU indicator. The above analysis shows that the proposed evaluation method is superior and more reasonable than the other three methods. Notwithstanding, there are still two methods with a result similarity of more than 60% with the proposed evaluation method, which indicates that the proposed evaluation method is reliable and feasible.

According to the above comparison and discussion, this study proposed a novel comprehensive evaluation method for grouting efficiency assessment by the combining interval type-2 fuzzy rough AHP and variable weight theory-based MABAC method, fully manipulating the intrapersonal and interpersonal uncertainties in the evaluation process, and considering the impact of indicator value diversity on the evaluation results. In conclusion, the proposed method can conduct a more objective, accurate and reasonable grouting efficiency evaluations in environment with multiple uncertainties.

Practical implication of the proposed model
In addition to the above theoretical implications, the proposed evaluation method also makes several practical contributions in grouting engineering. First, the proposed method considers the permeability and tightness of the rock mass at the same time in grouting evaluation, which can obtain scientific and reasonable evaluation results. Moreover, the proposed method can quantitatively evaluate the grouting efficiency of each tested interval through the evaluating score Ei to realize the fine evaluation and control of the overall grouting efficiency and local grouting efficiency of the grouting boreholes. Second, the proposed interval type-2 fuzzy rough AHP can handle the individual linguistic vagueness and the group preference diversity involved in the group decision process and makes it convenient for grouting engineers to capture the realistic judgments of group experts. Third, with the assistance of variable weight theory, the proposed method can avoid ignoring the negative influence of some abnormal indicator values on the evaluation results. When evaluating the grouting efficiency in an actual grouting project, the variable weight ratio can be adjusted according to the actual situation and site requirements. Therefore, the proposed evaluation method is appropriate to solve complex evaluation problems in actual grouting projects and provides valuable guidance for the reinforcement-grouting scheme.

Conclusion
Since the curtain grouting efficiency is related to the stability and safety of dam foundation construction, its evaluation is vital and significant. In this study, to address multiple uncertainties in the assessment, a MCDM model for curtain grouting efficiency comprehensive evaluation is proposed by integrating the interval type-2 fuzzy rough AHP and the extended MABAC method based on variable weight theory, and realized in a curtain grouting efficiency assessment problem of a hydropower station in Southwest China. The feasibility and superiority of the proposed method are verified by comparisons with several other methods, and the following conclusions were reached:

The interval type-2 fuzzy rough AHP is proposed to calculate the indicator weights under intrapersonal and interpersonal uncertainties environment. The results show that LU is the most important indicator related to the grouting efficiency, followed by RQD, FFR and V, which is the same as the results obtained by other comparison methods. In addition, the indicator weights calculated by the proposed method are in the middle position of those calculated by other comparison methods. This indicated that the proposed method is reliable and can integrate the advantages of other methods and has a more powerful uncertainty manipulation mechanism. Specifically, focusing on the uncertainty and ambiguity in the expert decision-making process, the interval type-2 fuzzy number is adopted to express the individual linguistic variables; then, the group interval type-2 fuzzy numbers are transferred to the interval type-2 fuzzy rough numbers by adopting the rough set, which aggregates the personal judgments to reveal the subjectivity and uncertainty in experts’ preferences within group decision-making environment. In addition, the interval type-2 fuzzy rough number is simply determined by the original data without any auxiliary information, which can better capture the experts’ actual perceptions and enhance the objectivity in a subjective environment.

Based on variable weight theory, the extended MABAC method is proposed to evaluate the grouting efficiency of each grouting borehole. Unlike most existing studies that use constant weights, this study adjusts them as variable weights, and the comparison results show that, compared with the evaluation results based on constant weight, the evaluation results based on variable weight are reduced to different degrees, which highlights the severity of the problem. In the evaluation process of the proposed method, the variable weight of the indicator reflects the importance of each indicator value to the evaluation result of the grouting efficiency, and the MABAC method has a simple mathematical framework and robust calculation results, which makes it a good combination with the proposed indicator weighting method to obtain accurate and reliable evaluation results.

The proposed evaluation method integrates the merits of several methods and ensures a more objective, informative and comprehensive evaluation result. In addition, the proposed model is highly practical and can help grouting engineers judge grouting efficiency more scientifically, and can effectively expose areas with poor grouting efficiency and provide guidance for formulating reinforcement-grouting schemes.

Despite all the merits, the proposed method still has some deficiencies worth studying in the future. First, the combination of the interval type-2 fuzzy rough number and the variable weight method with multi-criteria decision making makes the calculation more complicated, thus, future studies can develop the proposed evaluation method into a computational program to alleviate the workload of manual computation to make it applicable for more complex situations. Second, the individual influence weights of experts with different professional knowledge and experience backgrounds were not discussed in this work. Therefore, experts’ weights will be considered in the evaluation process in future research. In addition, the judgment of experts is not always rational. In the future, we will pay more attention to methods that reflect the bounded rationality of experts, such as regret theory, prospect theory and the TODIM method.
