In this article, a cooperative bilateral upper-limb rehabilitation robotic system based on mirror therapy (MT) and virtual stimulation was developed to assist hemiplegia in rehabilitation training. The hemiplegia’s affected limb can be placed on one of the robotic arms with a servomotor, and the healthy limb is placed on another side without servomotor. With the assistance of the robotic arm, the affected limb can track the healthy limb to perform mirror motion to complete the rehabilitation training. The robotic arm device can be adjusted personally to assist the patient's elbow joint flexion and wrist joint rotation. In order to enhance the willingness of patients to actively recover. A game-based rehabilitation training was developed to realize human–computer interaction and to provide visual stimulation. The adaptive proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller based on radial basis function (RBF) neural network has been adopted to improve the tracking performance of the affected side of robotic arm. The RBF neural network updates its parameters through the error signal between output of network and output of the system. The parameters of PID are updated by Jacobian matrix and the movement error between the healthy side and the affected side. Its abilities of RBF-PID controller about response speed, anti-interference and tracks are better than conventional PID controller’s through experimental validations. The system response was analyzed and graphed for different loading conditions. These error values of the angle of corresponding joint on both sides can be interpreted as very low. The system was proved to complete rehabilitation training and reflect the patient’s awareness of active rehabilitation.

Introduction
Stroke is a type of acute cerebrovascular disease with a high rate of disability, mortality and morbidity, and its clinical manifestations are cerebral ischemia or blockage of cerebral blood vessels caused by insufficient blood flow to the brain. Most of patients have varying degrees of dysfunction after waking up from a stroke. Hemiplegia often occurs. Modern rehabilitation theoretical studies suggest that adult’s central nervous system (CNS) is not completely irreversible. Its function can be restored by remodeling under certain conditions, and some neurons can be restored naturally for a period of time and regenerated to a certain extent after rehabilitation training [1]. Stimulating nerve remodel through limb movement is an important neurorehabilitation therapeutic approach, which brings good news for people with motor dysfunction to return to normal life. Mirror therapy (MT) is a treatment plan based on human mirror neurons, which was first proposed by Ramachandran in 1995 [36]. Rizzolatti et al. [37] observed that when monkeys saw the experimenter grabbing an apple, their ventral neurons in the premotor cortex were activated. This result shows that these neurons can perceive and map the actions of other individuals like a mirror. And MT for stroke patients has been reported to be effective in improving upper-limb motor function and daily life activity performance [11, 13, 15, 23, 25, 29, 34]. The effectiveness can be verified from the following two aspects: First, whether the patient's attention can be highly concentrated during exercise [2]. Second, whether the patient can achieve normal exercise coordination after treatment [3]. Some exoskeleton equipment and robotic have been successively applied in the field of rehabilitation. Experiments have shown that the rehabilitation robot which can assist stroke patients has significantly improved the effect of rehabilitation treatment [21, 22, 26, 33].

Various types of rehabilitation robots were developed to help patients move their limbs, or established different models for simulation, aiming to conform to ergonomics [17]. Xie et al. proposed the new equivalent kinematics model for the human upper limb for evaluating the existing upper-limb exoskeleton effectively [31]. Multi-degree-of-freedom robots have been developed and applied for rehabilitation. They can provide more degrees-of-freedom and help patients complete more rehabilitation actions [14, 27]. In 2021, Zhang et al. developed a bilateral end-effector upper-limb rehabilitation robot (BEULRR) [35]. Its healthy side guides the affected side to complete bilateral symmetric training. For the accuracy control of robots, the most traditional method is to use PID controllers. But the parameters of the PID controller are difficult to adjust. Therefore, more intelligent control algorithms are studied. Controllers based on fuzzy logic are often used [10, 32]. A reduced adaptive fuzzy system together with a compensation term was proposed in W. Sun et al. [38]. It overcomes the problem from using traditional fuzzy approximator. In the research of E. Kilic et al., Fuzzy PD + PID controller could reduce position tracking errors more effectively than other controllers [18]. With the development of artificial intelligence, methods such as deep learning are gradually being applied to robotic control. Wang Min et al. [39] presented dynamic learning from adaptive neural control(ANC), combining a filter tracking error with radial basis function (RBF) neural network (NN), to improve the system of Robot manipulators performances without time-consuming online parameter adjustment process. In research of Freire E.O., [40] adaptive neural PID (AN-PID) controller was applied to a nonlinear dynamics to solve the problem of tracking errors. And neural network such as RBF is often adopted to solve the problem of how to tune PID parameters adaptively in many articles [41,42,43].

In addition, in the subsequent research of upper-limb rehabilitation robots, people continuously strengthen human–computer interactions through various methods, providing different feedback information for treatment, increasing active participation, and realizing the combination of muscle movement rehabilitation and the nervous system [9]. Cai et al. developed a patient-cooperative device with the capacity to understand the intention of the user. They present an upper-limb motion pattern recognition method using surface electromyography (sEMG) signals with a support vector machine (SVM) [12]. For instance, Bandara et al. [4] at Kyushu University in Japan designed an upper-limb rehabilitation system based on brain–computer interface for motion prediction. Collecting the motor imagination brain electricity by the brain electrical amplifier, and input it to the neural network and the classifier, in order to obtain the dynamic characteristics of the brain electrical signal, and realize the prediction of the movement intention. In 2013, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University developed a wearable hand exoskeleton device–Hands of Hope [5]. The surface electromyography is used to detect the user's active movement intention, and the exoskeleton drives to respond to grasping or release. The application of the posture signal is to realize the motion tracking of the robot by acquiring the spatial position of the limbs. In order to solve the problem of decoding upper extremity motion intent to trigger active and intuitive motor training for the patients, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology’s Oluwarotimi Williams Samuel [44] proposed a new approach based on spatiotemporal neuromuscular descriptor and adaptive filtering technique (STD-AFT) to optimally characterize multiple patterns of upper extremity movements in post-stroke patients. Song et al. of Kagawa University in Japan used inertial sensors to track the movement of the patient's upper limbs and smoothly controlled a four-degree-of-freedom upper-limb rehabilitation robot to complete real-time active rehabilitation training by a double closed-loop control [6]. In order to solve the problem of wearing when using bioelectric signals and gesture signals, people introduce visual signals into active rehabilitation [16, 20, 28]. Kinect, as a widely used vision sensor technology, can directly capture high-precision motion without touching the human body [7]. The upper-limb neurorehabilitation virtual environment REAPP developed by Mottura et al. uses Kinect to track the patient's movement and displays it in the GUI in real time for patient observation and imitation [8]. In addition, virtual reality technology has been proven by multiple studies to have a positive impact on stroke recovery [8, 19, 24, 29]. The findings in Weber’s paper supported that virtual reality technologies enhanced mirror therapies for stroke survivors [30].

At present, the development of upper-limb rehabilitation robots has gradually demonstrated the advantages that traditional rehabilitation does not have, but active robots are only suitable for patients with strong exercise capabilities. The use of EMG, EEG and other equipments for motion intention prediction or motion control is extremely costly, requiring long-term wear of electrodes and many complex sensors. Solutions based on vision sensors do not work well in some situations, such as lighting environments and occlusions. Therefore, this paper introduces a bilateral collaborative rehabilitation training robot. The robot has a left–right symmetrical structure, which assists in completing the mirror movement of the patient's upper limbs on both sides. In addition, a virtual reality interactive environment was designed, which interacts with the patient through sensors and enhances the patient's active rehabilitation awareness through games. PID controller is a mature control algorithm. But the traditional PID has fixed parameters, making it difficult to deal with disturbances that may occur during working. In order to ensure that the affected side of robotic arm can track the healthy side of robotic in real time, an intelligent PID controller based on RBF neural network was studied. The contributions can be summarized as follows:

a)
Combining the movement characteristics of patients with hemiplegia, the synergy of normal people's movement and mirror therapy, a bilateral cooperative robot that can be individually adjusted was designed. Through the sensor system and control system of the robot, the movement information of the healthy and the affected side is collected, and the robot is driven by the movement difference of the healthy and affected side to assist the patient with coordinated movement and complete rehabilitation training.

b)
Set up a virtual environment and design a suitable game to guide patients in rehabilitation training. Besides, introducing the visual signal into the rehabilitation robot system to form biofeedback training.

c)
Based on the concept of mirror image therapy and the movement characteristics of patients with hemiplegia, a bilateral cooperative control strategy was proposed. Taking the movement difference of the healthy side as the driving signal, and using the PID parameter self-tuning algorithm based on RBF neural network, it is used to predict the movement trajectory of the affected side limb, which is greatly improved compared with the traditional PID.

This article is organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents the overall design of the robot system, including mechanical structure design, sensor system design, control system design and visual stimulation scheme. Bilateral cooperative control strategies including information acquisition on the healthy and affected side, control system identification, and adaptive PID controller based on RBF neural network are applied to this system in Sect. 3. Section 4 conducts response test, anti-interference test and coordination test of the whole system. Finally, summary of the content of this article and discussion of follow-up work in Sect. 5.

In this section, the design of the cooperative bilateral upper-limb rehabilitation robotic system is introduced in detail. These details include the mechanical structure and its mathematical model, control system and visual stimulation program. The architecture of the rehabilitation robotic system is shown in Fig. 1. The architecture shows the hardware platform of this robotic system and the game-based rehabilitation method. The cooperative bilateral upper-limb structure has been designed for mirror therapy exercises. Bilateral robotic arms are ordered to perform cooperative movement by the differences of upper-limbs motion signal. Rehabilitation training is designed as a game. The virtual upper limbs can track the movement of the patient’s realistic upper limbs movement in real time.

The rehabilitation system is aimed at the rehabilitation training of large joints in the early rehabilitation of hemiplegic patients, including elbow joint and wrist joint. The degrees-of-freedom (DOF) of the elbow joint and the wrist joint are shown in Fig. 2. The elbow joint is a hinge joint with one DOF. In this article, the movement of the wrist joint is described as the rotation of forearm.

The range of motion(ROM) of elbow joint and wrist joint is an essential issue to consider while designing the mechanical structure because this system will be directly contacted with the upper limbs. Thus, mechanical limits should be added to this system to respect the range of motion of two joints. Table 1 shows the ROM of two joints.

As previously mentioned, preliminary design and modeling are completed with SolidWorks, through which simulating the rehabilitation process. And the mechanical structure determined with the recommendation of rehabilitation therapists finally.

The hardware of upper-limb rehabilitation robotic system is divided into three parts: the symmetrical robotic arm, the table and the electric control cabinet. The electric control cabinet is integrated with NI-myRIO, power supply, motor driver, buttons, indicator lights and others. Devices are connected through the cable harness. Figure 3a shows the symmetrical robotic arms. The robotic arm without servomotors is defined as healthy side of hemiplegia, and another with servomotors is defined as affected side. The spacing between two robotic arms can be adjusted as well as the length of robotic arms. Figure 3b shows some details of the robotic arm with servomotors. One of motors drives the elbow joint to flexion and extension, and another drives the wrist joint to rotation. Both of them have applied mechanical limits to ensure safety. The motor can be unloaded and placed on another side. Angle sensors and torque sensors are placed on the two joints for measurement and control. The inclination and height of the table can be individually adjusted as shown in Fig. 3c.

Sensors and control system
Two angle sensors and two torque sensors placed on the affected side collect the movement information of elbow joint and wrist joint. The inertial measurement unit(IMU) is developed to obtain the data of posture of healthy side. IMU can obtain the roll angle which represents the rotation angle of the wrist joint and the yaw angle which represents the flexion angle and extension angle of the wrist joint. Data from the IMU are transmitted to the control system by Wi-Fi. Figure 5 shows the diagram of sensors and control system.

NI-myRIO is a main embedded device for this control system. The data from sensors of both side can be acquired and analyzed on NI-myRIO. Data will be converted into pulse-width modulation(PWM) signal to drive the motor for mirror therapy.

Visual stimulation program
In this article, a game-based rehabilitation method was adopted for rehabilitation training and provides visual stimulation program. The virtual environment was developed on 3DMax, and the character model was built and run in Unity 3D. The character can follow the patient to move synchronously. Combined with the traditional training methods of upper limbs and daily exercise, games are designed to guide patients in rehabilitation training.

Virtual reality-based training game includes two parts: build virtual reality environment and design interactive element. The virtual environment shown in Fig. 6 is built on 3DMAX, and the model of virtual environment is imported into Unity3D.

The data are collected by IMU and transmitted to the client for storage and processing. A local connection is established between Labview and Unity for data communication through Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Labview is the client, and Unity3D is the server. The trajectory of the end of the arm is calculated through forward kinematics. And the trajectory will be mapped to the coordinate system in the virtual environment through mapping workspace. The virtual characters are driven by these processed data and feedback to the user in the way of visual stimulation. The process is shown in Fig. 7.

The data of both sides of upper limbs are transmitted to the virtual environment by TCP. The virtual character will perform the same movement as the realistic arms by motion retargeting. In order to enable patients to observe their current state of limb movement, user interface provides different visions. After the game, it will score and set up a reward mechanism. In addition, software limit is designed to ensure safety.

Control of rehabilitation robotic system
The symmetrical robotic arm is controlled by the difference in the movement data of the healthy side and the affected side according to the characteristics of movement disorders of patients with hemiplegia and the movement characteristics of mirror therapy. Figure 8 shows the structure of the control plan.

System identification
In order to improve the accuracy of system control, it is necessary to model the motor system. The System Identification Toolbox™ in MATLAB2018b is used to model the robotic arms by black-box modeling. Therefore, it is necessary to collect the input data and output data of the motor system. In order to reduce the interference of man-made movement to make the final model more fitting. An external stepping motor is used to drive the healthy-side mechanical arm at a constant speed, and the motion data of healthy side are collected by IMU as input data. The motion data of the affected side mechanical arm are collected by the angle sensor as output data.

To identify black-box models, we must specify the model order. To solve the problem, we estimate simple polynomial models for a range of orders and delays and compare the performance of these models. Choose the orders and delays that correspond to the best model fit as an initial guess for more accurate modeling using various model structures. The data of both side are divided into training set and test side in ratio of 6:4. The parameters are pre-estimated by the autoregressive models with exogenous (ARX). ARX model can be described as Eqs.19–20. The parameter range is set from 1 to 10 to reduce model complexity and prevent overfitting. The best fit value is shown in Fig. 9. Then, many models shown in Fig. 10 such as multiple models, including ARMAX, state space, ARX, transfer function, are compared based on result of pre-estimates. Upper right of the picture shows the goodness of fit. Finally, autoregressive moving average with extra input (ARMAX) model with the best fit is adopted to describe this system. The model structure and its parameters are described as Eqs. 19–23.

Obtain and analysis of motion data
Two ways, rotating around its own coordinate axis or rotating around the reference coordinate axis, can be described as spatial posture information when the position of an object changes. The corresponding rotation angle is usually expressed by Euler angle. Its rotation matrix is shown in Eq. 24.

𝑅𝑋𝑌𝑍=⎡⎣⎢⎢𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛽𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛾𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛾+𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛾−𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛽+𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛾−𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛽𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛾−𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛽𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛾+𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛾𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛽𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛾+𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛾𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛽−𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛽𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛽⎤⎦⎥⎥
(24)
Gimbal lock may occur when using Euler angle to describe the rotation. Thus, the rotation vectors and rotation angles are usually represented by quaternion. And then, turning the quaternion into Euler angles. Equation 25 shows the relations between Euler angles and quaternions.(𝑥,𝑦,𝑧,𝜔) represents the quaternions, and 𝜃,𝜓,𝜑 represent the Euler angle.

⎡⎣⎢⎢𝜑𝜃𝜓⎤⎦⎥⎥=⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑛2(2(𝜔𝑥+𝑦𝑧),1−2(𝑥2+𝑦2))arcsin(2(𝜔𝑦−𝑧𝑥))𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑛2(2(𝜔𝑧+𝑥𝑦),1−2(𝑦2+𝑧2))⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥
(25)
In this article, the data of affected side can be gotten from the angle sensors placed in elbow joint and wrist joint. Euler angle obtained from IMU is described as movement posture of the healthy limb. Because of the high-frequency noise from accelerometers and magnetometers, data are unstable. The use of high-pass filtering on the gyroscope to filter out low-frequency noise can obtain the precise angular velocity at each moment. And then, the rotation angle is obtained by integrating the angular velocity. However, errors will accumulate in this process. In order to improve the accuracy and the dynamic characteristics of the system, a 9-axis inertial sensor is selected as part of the IMU. 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis magnetometer are integrated on a 9-axis inertial sensor. The Euler angle is analyzed by fusing the data of these three sensors.

In this paper, the yaw angle 𝜓 represents the flexion angle of healthy-side elbow joint, and the roll angle 𝜑 represents the rotation angle of healthy-side wrist joint.

Adaptive PID controller based on RBF neural networks
Cooperative bilateral exercise training has the problem of unsynchronized movement between affected and healthy sides. The affected side will lag or overshoot, when the healthy moves too fast or stops abruptly. In order to solve this problem, an adaptive PID controller based on RBF neural network is adopted. RBF neural network works for adjusting PID parameters.

The RBF neural network model has a three-layer structure: the input layer, the hidden layer, and the output layer. Gaussian function is frequently selected as the radial basis function of RBF neural network. 𝑅𝑗 is the output of j-th neuron in the m nodes of hidden layer as Eq. 26. The forward propagation can be described as Eq. 27.

𝑅𝑗(𝑥)=𝑒𝑥𝑝(−∥𝑥−𝑐𝑗𝑖∥22𝑏2𝑗),j=1,2…, m

𝑦𝑚=𝑤1ℎ1+𝑤2ℎ2+…+𝑤𝑚ℎ𝑚

where.

𝑥 — n-dimensional input vector

𝑐𝑗𝑖 — the center vector of the j-th basis function

𝑏𝑗 — the base bandwidth parameter of the hidden layer

∥𝑥−𝑐𝑗𝑖∥−− the norm of the vector 𝑥−𝑐𝑗𝑖, its represents the length from 𝑥to𝑐𝑗𝑖

𝑤𝑗 — the network weight

𝑦𝑚— output of forward propagation

Gradient descent method is adopted as the learning method of RBF in this algorithm. Its performance index is shown as Eq. 28. 𝑦(𝑘) represents input of RBF neural network at time t. 𝑦𝑚(𝑘)represents the output of forward propagation of the neural network.

Results and discussion
In this section, experiments were carried out to test the functions and performance of the cooperative bilateral upper-limb rehabilitation system. Before these experiments, some preparatory works had been done. The servomotors are placed on the left of symmetrical robotic arm, and IMU is placed on the right of it. It means the right robotic arm is the healthy side. The left side which represents affected side is aimed to track the movement of the left. As for software, Labview, as a control platform and communication device, needs to install some software about NI-myRIO drivers and VISA. Ensure that the system is working properly. In addition to the mechanical device limit, software limit is also used in programming, and its threshold is slightly smaller than the mechanical limit range.

A large learning rate may cause the model to converge to a suboptimal solution, and a small increasing the convergence time. Therefore, in this test, the learning rate of RBF-PID is set to 0.8, and the learning rate of PID is set to 0.8. Then, a step signal and interference signal are entered to systems. According to the simulation results, the adaptive PID based on RBF neural network has smaller overshoot and better stability. Compared with conventional PID, it has better adaptability and better robustness. When the system is disturbed, the RBF-PID controller has a small oscillation amplitude and a fast recovery speed that improve that RBF-PID controller has stronger anti-interference ability.

A simulation was carried out on MATLAB R2018b to verify the tracking performance of the system based on PID or RBF-PID. The experiment steps as follows.

A known signal measuring for the healthy side of robotic arm is input into both systems, one uses PID only and the other uses RBF-PID, simultaneously to assess the difference between the signals from the two systems’ output.

(c)
Plot and compare two kinds of data.

The results are shown in Fig. 13. The red one is angular velocity signal of wrist joint of healthy side measured by IMU. RBF-PID is superior to conventional PID in terms of adjustment speed and tracking accuracy as shown in Fig. 11. There is almost no overshoot in the adjustment process, with good control accuracy and efficiency.

In this article, an experiment was carried out to verify the system's bilateral motion synergy. The performance of the system under different loading conditions is verified as shown in Figs. 14, 15 and 16. Three scenarios were designed in this experiment: (a). No loading on the affected side of symmetrical robotic arms. (b). Place a wooden prosthetic arm on the affected side of symmetrical robotic arms. (c). Place a realistic arm on the affected side of symmetrical robotic arm. The tracking ability of the affected side of robotic arm was tested through the above experimental scenarios. According to the experiment, the error range between robotic arms under movement is about 2°in cases of different loads.

Finally, a functional test for the whole system was carried out to verify whether the game-based rehabilitation program can work and whether cooperative training on both sides of the upper limbs can work. First, initialize the system, including training method, limit threshold, speed threshold, resistance, etc. Then turn to the game training content, the patient can use the healthy arm to drive the affected arm for training according to the game task goal. Figure 17 shows the training scene. By implementing the proposed method and related experiments, this system is proven to safely assist patients in completing game-based rehabilitation training.

Conclusions
The content and contribution of this article are summarized as follow:

Combined mirror therapy and visual stimulation, proposing the rehabilitation method of using the healthy limb to control the affected limb for rehabilitation training for hemiplegia.

The 3D model designed in the solid works environment was manufactured. The symmetrical robotic arm for coordinated movement was designed as a personalized adjustment device. And sensors system was designed to measure the rotation angle of robot joint.

A game-based human–computer interaction system was developed. It provides visual stimulation and guides hemiplegia in rehabilitation training. Virtual characters can track the movements of realistic human arms. And biofeedback training is achieved by visual stimulation.

Combining the movement characteristics of hemiplegia and the characteristics of mirror therapy, a rehabilitation program is proposed. Control the movement of the affected limb by the movement data of the healthy limb. Then, the difference signal between both sides was used as a feedback signal to control the affected side for bilateral coordinated movement.

An adaptive PID controller based on RBF neural networks was applied to the system. It was verified by experiments that the RBF-PID controller has better robustness and anti-interference ability than conventional PID. Using the RBF-PID controller, the affected side of symmetrical robotic can better track the healthy side of it.

The focus of future work will be on the optimization of the algorithm to further improve the synergy of bilateral movement. Some physiological signals may be adopted as feedback data to reflect the patient's active intention better, such as electromyography signal and electroencephalography signal, and to provide a variety of training modes and control strategies. AR or VR technology can be used for human–computer interaction to enhance immersion.
