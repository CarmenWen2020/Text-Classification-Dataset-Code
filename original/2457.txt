Suspicious volumetric tumor (SVT) segmentation of a CT-image (CT_{i}) and analysing changes in the volume of tumor is a significantly challenging task for the identification of lung cancer. In this regard, we design a two-step suspicious volumetric tumor segmentation (SVTS) approach based on an adaptive multiple resolution contour (AMRC) models for effective SVT segmentation. First, the high-intensity-pixels edge centroid of SVT (HECS) method is designed to identify the SVT location in CT_{i}, and these outcomes are subsequently conceding threshold values to fix the level set method (LSM). Second, HECS outcomes are recognised using particle swarm optimisation (PSO) which is harmonised twin support vector machines (TSVM) to achieve segmentation accuracy. An open-source tumor cancer imaging archive (TCIA) dataset, 529 abnormal tissues (ATs) of the lung from the lung image database consortium (LIDC), are conceded to assess the performance of the SVT segmentation approach. The average segmentation accuracy of NLTC, TCIA, and LIDC datasets are 73.19%, 76.21% and 75.89%, respectively, compared with standard benchmark approaches. Subsequently, our framework efficiently classified the normal and abnormal CT_{i} based on the SVT segmentation accuracy rate.

Introduction
Tissue cell breakdown in the lungs is the broadest infection, elevated mortality among all types of diseases. As per 2012 world records, 1.5 million deaths from around 1.83 million cases. The reason for tissue cell breakdown in the lungs is smoking, poisonous particles all around, maturing, and so on [1, 2]. Sadly, individuals feel unequipped findings and techniques would not be helpful to check the occurrence of disease, and then it is practically difficult to track down to fix the issue when patients are in the terminal phase of disease under the ebb and flow condition. The affirmed instances of lung disease are typically joined by proceeding with the rising of knobs/nodules. Early location of the disease can incredibly improve the endurance paces of patients. Unmistakably, the lung knob discovery in the underlying phase of computer-aided determination (CAD) plans is astounding and obligatory.

The disease identification and verification are carried out for decades based on the computed tomography (CT) images. The high pixel resolution, low distortions, and strong contrast of chest anatomical structures are significant factors during lung cancer detection [3, 4]; but the radiologist would further diagnose it. However, screening these enormous pathological images remain consumes plenty of time and effort.

Lung cancer is a deadlier disease and a primary concern of high mortality. Nowadays, machine learning strategies play a crucial role in detecting and predicting medical diseases at the early stages. The CAD remains an effective cancer prediction approach to examine the inner details of the body, restore and extract the information for lung cancer diagnosis. There are several stages of processing techniques, such as lung processing technique and segment processing technique which identify each part of the segment [5,6,7]. Various clustering methods and edge detection methods are utilized for the prediction of the affected region. These techniques extract the small segment features from the lungs to identify the affected area. Sometimes the high-frequency signals may not assess the same affected segment region but can accomplish with a dark background and signalling entropy to achieve robust results.

In this work, a novel multiple resolution contour-based high-intensity-pixels edge centroid of SVT (HECS) model is proposed for effective segmentation of dubious volumes of tumor regions. The proposed segmentation strategy adequately deals with the issues related to the division of SVT without human intercession. First, the high-intensity-pixels edge centroid of SVT (HECS) mechanism measures SVT location in CT_{i}, and these outcomes are subsequently conceded as threshold values to fix the level set method (LSM). Second, HECS outcomes are regulated particle swarm optimization (PSO) strategy, harmonized with twin support vector machines (TSVMs) to achieve segmentation accuracy. The segmentation outcomes are subjectively, quantitatively being analyzed through base realities. Our manuscript objectives are listed below

The remaining paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 describes the related work of segmentation and feature classifications models and their research gaps. The section describes the SVTS approach along with HECS and PSO-TSVM models. Detailed experimental setup and results have been discussed in Sect. 4. The concluding remarks are presented in Sect. 5.

Related work
AT detection is an important research domain; thus, the scholars have been focused on it for the past twenty years [8]. The existing region segmentation methods, such as comprise a clustering-based method, colour quantization-based method, active contour-based method (ACM), and Hybrid intelligence technique, are concentrated on contrast-based decision-making [9,10,11]. However, the Chan-Vese Level Set Method (CV-LSM) has an adaptive investigation for the segmentation of the AT classification. Frequently, the current level set methods are grouped into 2 types: edge-based methods (EMs) and region-based methods (RMs). However, the EMs often suffer from over, under-segmentation, and boundary leakage as in most of the CT images because of mysterious edge presence [12,13,14]. On the other hand, the RMs work on blurred object boundaries and noise. However, both the LSMs are sensitive to initialize the contour location. Typically, an improper initialization of the level set function (LSF) may increase the number of iterations which impacts overall execution time.

In [15], correlation learning mechanism (CLM) has been designed for tumor detection by changing the grids to extract the features for palettes in every iteration of CT images. A hybrid weighted fuzzy k-means (WFKM) tumor segmentation method has been designed based on a weight fuzzification strategy on spatial context to resolve the segmentation with exponential iteration increments in [16]. However, the weight fuzzification strategy is moderate and affects the accuracy rate. Subsequently, K-means clustering, integrated with Fuzzy C-Means (KMFCM) method [17] have been designed for automatic detection and segmentation of tumors. In [18], a novel tumor segmentation approach is designed based on the correlation among multi-modalities with encoder, but estimation or analysis of the background image correlation is not considered. A local direction of gradient (LDOG) encoding method is designed to assess the image features and z-score algorithm to measure the tumor boundary, but occlusion of organs region detection and image background constraints are not considered in [19]. A hard swish-based RELU activation function has been designed to classify the tumor types with features extracted from the histogram but has concentrated on classifying three tumors (meningiomas, gliomas, and pituitary tumors) and not considered the information loss optimization methods [20]. A quantum genetic algorithm has been designed with SVM to formulize multi-level thresholding based on Tsallis entropy for estimating the tumor edge in [21], but noise removal strategies are not considered, which leads to making an inadequate diagnosis.

In [22], based on filters, the nodule/abnormal tissue (AT) and vessel enhancement are classified by clustering approach with variant extracted features for differentiating false nodules with a genetic algorithm as well artificial neural networks (ANNs) during the classification stage. In [23], the anticipated three-dimensional shape feature extraction (FE) approach has been designed to identify lung ATs. The multi-scale dot and enrichment filter helps to identify AT images based on extracted nodules feature with support vector machine (SVM) classification. In [24], a 3D blob algorithm has been designed to segregate AT images based on connectivity algorithms. Here, 8- features are extracted to assess the true and false AT with SVM classifier.

In [25], a novel system was designed to provide intelligent identification of AT based on juxta-pleural, and 33-features are confined based on the shape and texture of AT detection. In [26], the author concentrated on the identification of small ATs (2-10 mm). The region growing (RG) technique is used to segment lung parenchyma and structures inside the lung with Gaussian mixture methods and Hessian matrix. As for texture features, Tsallis’s and Shannon’s entropy areas are confined to classifying suspect AT regions with SVM. In [27], a CAD system was designed for juxta-pleural AT identification. A stable 3D mass-spring model (MSM) enabled with a spline curve restoration was utilized to determine AT segmentation issues. In addition, the neural network (NN) was deployed to minimize false positives through grey value along with shape FE from AT images. In [28], adopted fuzzy-based clustering models have deployed AT segmentation, and SVM-based 3-kernel functions were used to attain accurate classification outcomes. In [29], thoraco-abdominal lymph AT apprehension and analysis have been processed based on convolution neural networks (CNN). In [30], 3D CNN features learning for AT apprehension, and unsupervised 3D regions remain deployed to measure AT in CT images.

All the above methods have concentrated on effective suspicious volumetric tumor (SVT) segmentation to assess the tumor size change during tumor volume orientation in CT-image (CT_{i}) but have not achieved expected accuracy. In this regard, there is scope to design a two-step suspicious volumetric tumor segmentation (SVTS) approach based on an adaptive multiple resolution contours (AMRCs) model for effective SVT segmentation. First, the high-intensity-pixels edge centroid of SVT (HECS) method is designed to identify the SVT location. The level set method (LSM) is designed based on a threshold value to assess the tumor edge. Second, particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is designed with twin support vector machines (TSVM) to achieve segmentation accuracy.

Proposed model
A SVT segmentation technique is designed based on two novel methods: the high-intensity-pixels edge centroid of SVT (HECS) method is designed to identify the SVT location in TLI, and these outcomes are subsequently conceded to assess the threshold value to fix the level set method (LSM). Second, HECS method outcomes are considered as an input for particle swarm optimisation (PSO). The PSO mechanism effectively classifies the non-linear pixels based on twin support vector machines (TSVM) to achieve segmentation accuracy. Figure 1 outlines the workflow of the proposed segmentation system. Initially, the greyscale image is fed to the HECS system, and the abnormal tissue is categorised into 2-types, tissue background region (TBR), abnormal tissue region (ATR).

Identification of suspicious regions
The SVT is associated with a substantial area that has an average intensity over the remaining CT image. It is profoundly homogeneous, and this homogeneity slowly diminishes towards the limit. The SVT size is generally light in contrast with the entire CT image. The TBR is non-consistently dispersed with a grave extent of homogeneity. Fixing the effective threshold mechanism is designed with the HECS model for accurate SVT segmentation of abnormal CT images.

The grey level histogram without background remains vital in concluding the edge of a peak with its pixel contrast. It is a challenging issue because every histogram has various peak and valley sizes. Our main concentration is on peak sizes to fix the threshold value during suspicious volume segmentation. Therefore, the grayscale without background is denoted with {I_p}, \mathbb {Q} = \{ {q_1},{q_2}, \ldots ,{q_{b - 1}}\}, where \mathbb {Q} refers gray level of {I_p}, b refers to gray levels. The segmentation of SVT remains estimated with the anticipated threshold value, and it is denoted with \Upsilon, which is estimated for each {I_p} based on its \mathbb {Q} vector.

The peak value of each {I_p} signifies to estimate the threshold value, but not vice versa. The peak selection purely depends on the concern issue. Hence, the peaks are finalized with less production threshold (PT), denoted with \mu. The notable point is that the peak region remains smaller than the area of SVT in CT images. This phenomenon motivated us to consider PSO instead of the valley context. Therefore, the production threshold (PT) estimates with Eq. 1.

\begin{aligned}&\mu = 0.35 \times \frac{{Max\left( {{q_1},{q_2}, \ldots ,{q_{b - 1}}} \right) }}{\hbar } - \lambda \end{aligned}	(1)
\begin{aligned}&\hbar = \frac{{{{\sum \limits _{j = 1}^b {{q_j}} } \Bigg / h}}}{{\sum \limits _{j = 1}^b {{q_j}} }},\,\,\,\,{q_j} > \lambda \end{aligned}	(2)
\begin{aligned}&\lambda = \left( {{1 / Q}} \right) \cdot \sum \limits _{j = 1}^b {{q_j}} \end{aligned}	(3)
where h refers peaks count, Q refers gray level (GL) count of image {I_p}. Let S = [{q_1},{q_2}, \ldots ,{q_{b - 1}}] refers GL array of every peak selected based on Eq. 1. Here, \lambda (S), \hat{\lambda } refers mean and standard deviation of array of GL, which are used to estimate the initial threshold and it is estimated with Eq. 4 based on a bounded condition represented in Eq. 5.

\begin{aligned}&{\Upsilon _\mathrm{{ini}}} = \lambda (S) - \hat{\lambda }(S) \end{aligned}	(4)
\Upsilon = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}l} {\lambda (I),} & {\Upsilon _{{{\text{ini}}}} < \lambda (I)} \\ {\Upsilon_{{{\text{ini}}}} ,} & {{\text{Otherwise}}} \\ \end{array} } \right.	(5)
The mean of {I_p} is estimated with below Eq. 6

\begin{aligned} \lambda (I) = \left( {{1 / {\left( {a,J} \right) }}} \right) \cdot \sum \limits _{i = 1}^a {\sum \limits _{j = 1}^b {{I_p}(i,j)} } \,\,\,\,\,\forall \,\,p \in P \end{aligned}	(6)
Each pixel in I_p remain classified as SVT or CT-image background volume (CBV) pixel based on the condition {I_p}(i,j) \geqslant {\Upsilon _\mathrm{{ini}}}, which is elaborated in below Eq. 7.

{\text{Pixel}}\;{\text{of}} = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}l} {{\text{SVT}},} & {I_{p} (i,j) \ge \Upsilon _{{{\text{ini}}}} l} \\ {{\text{CBV}},} & {{\text{Otherwise}}} \\ \end{array} } \right.	(7)
In other words, if {I_p}(i,j) \geqslant {\Upsilon _\mathrm{{ini}}}, then I{_p}(i,j) remain reflected under SVT pixel; otherwise, CBV pixel.

High-intensity-pixels edge centroid of SVT (HECS) approach separates the SVTs as per the below policy. Let consider \Theta _p^{{\Upsilon _{\text {ini}}}} is the fixed threshold image. The HECS (\varphi _p^r) of each region (r) of each image I_p is estimated with Eq. 8.

\begin{aligned} \varphi _p^r = \left( {\frac{{\sum {{\varphi ^r}(i,j) \times i} }}{{{\varphi ^r}(i,j) \times 0.25}},\frac{{\sum {{\varphi ^r}(i,j) \times j} }}{{{\varphi ^r}(i,j) \times 0.25}}} \right) \end{aligned}	(8)
where {{\varphi ^r}(i,j)} refers HECS values at (i, j) coordinates. Subsequently, the regions are delete to accomplish the nominated accuracy and it is carried out based on the bellow algorithm 1.

In some scenarios, HECS may violate the bounded suspicious volume because of the dipped shape region. To streamline this issue, a bounded region value is fixed which is between 1-to-4, can observe it in algorithm 2. The main objective of this algorithm to confine the HECS value MUST be within the suspicious volume (SV) of the region of the image.

The feature extraction (FE) and feature classification (FC) are two critical factors to enhance the accuracy of the proposed system with CT images, as can be observed in Fig. 2. The multiple confined features are less than 16-feature; since 16-feature models have exceptional accuracy. When the feature count is less, the computation complexity remains higher. The designed data normalization model avoids this issue by regulating the value between [0, 1].

Therefore, the region’s elongation, diameter, and perimeter factors are confined to assess the abnormality region in the CT image. Here, shapes and structural features play an important role during extraction. Edge-centroid area (ECA), edge-centroid longest diameter (ECLD), edge-entroid shortest diameter (ECLD), edge-centroid elongation (ECE), edge-centroid perimeter (ECP), edge-centroid roundness (ECR)(\phi) factors are playing a vital role to assess the SVT segmentation over suspicious regions of the Grayscale CT images. These factors are estimated with the below Eqs. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, respectively.

\begin{aligned}&\mathrm{{area}}= \sum \limits _{i = 1}^a {\sum \limits _{j = 1}^b {\varphi _p^r\,(i,j)} } \end{aligned}	(9)
\begin{aligned}&\mathrm{{ECLD}} = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{{{\left( {{i_1} - {i_2}} \right) }^2} + {{\left( {{j_1} - {j_2}} \right) }^2}} \end{aligned}	(10)
\begin{aligned}&\mathrm{{ECSD}} = \sqrt{{{\left( {{i_2} - {i_1}} \right) }^2} + {{\left( {{j_2} - {j_1}} \right) }^2}} \end{aligned}	(11)
{\text{ECE}} = \frac{{{\text{ECLD}}}}{{{\text{ECP}}}}	(12)
\begin{aligned}&\mathrm{{ECP}} = \mathrm{{EC}} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \mathrm{{OC}} \end{aligned}	(13)
\begin{aligned}&\phi = \frac{{4\pi \times \mathrm{{area}}}}{{{P^2}}} \end{aligned}	(14)
Redundancy remain play an important role in accuracy assessment. Therefore, the estimation of discrete coincidence between CT image coordinate values is carried out with the below Eq. 15.

\begin{aligned} {I_p}(i,j) = \sum \limits _{i = 1}^a {\sum \limits _{j = 1}^b {\log \left( {\frac{{\mathrm{X}(i,j)}}{{{\mathrm{X}_1}(i,j){\mathrm{X}_2}(i,j)}}} \right) } } \end{aligned}	(15)
where {\mathrm{X}(i,j)} refers i, j productive probability is also called distribution function (DF). {{\mathrm{X}_1}(i,j)} and {{\mathrm{X}_2}(i,j)} refers fringe of DF and where, i, j are random variables.

The {{F_s}[e]} is the opted as a feature set and {{F_s}} is the finalised features count. Equation 16 refers least redundancy stipulation and Eq. 17 refers most significance stipulation, both are play a vital role to assess the accurate feature to enhance the accuracy based on the phenomenal combination as defined in the following Eqs. 18 and 19.

\begin{aligned}&\begin{aligned} {\chi _p} = \frac{1}{{\sqrt{{F_s}} }}\sum \limits _{e = 1}^E {{I_p}\left( {{F_e},{F_{e + 1}}} \right) } \\ \mathrm{{Min}}\left( {{\chi _p}} \right) \\ \end{aligned} \end{aligned}	(16)
\begin{aligned}&\begin{aligned} {\gamma _p} = \frac{1}{{\sqrt{{{\left( {{F_s}} \right) }^2}} }}\sum \limits _{n = 1}^N {\sum \limits _{e = 1}^E {{I_p}\left( {{F_e},\overrightarrow{{V_n}} } \right) } } \\ \mathrm{{Max}} \left( {{\gamma _p}} \right) \\ \end{aligned} \end{aligned}	(17)
Based on the above equations, the estimation values are inputs to the PSO-TSVM classifier to assess the best features to accomplish the performance and accuracy of the proposed system.

\begin{aligned}&\mathrm{{Max}}\left( {{\gamma _p} - {\chi _p}} \right) \end{aligned}	(18)
\begin{aligned}&\mathrm{{Max}}\left( {\frac{{{\gamma _p}}}{{{\chi _p}}}} \right) \end{aligned}	(19)
The PSO method measures the threshold value based on HECS method outcomes. The main contribution is estimating the threshold fitness function with edge centroid pixel resolution, removing the image background pixels with a low information loss rate is a tangible issue, which is resolved by the PSO approach. PSO-based TSVM model mainly segregates two classes, one is the SVT pixel class which helps to identify the suspicious region, and the other is CBV pixel class which helps to reduce the region detection error rate and it formulates decision-making analysis. Subsequently, Algorithm 1 assesses the suspicious region; and the anticipated pixels are to be in the HECS bounded region, which is accomplished based on Algorithm 2 by identifying and removing dipped share region and image background pixels.

Experimental result analysis
The SVTS approach is developed in MATLAB, Python, and R languages with ML packages and library functions. All ML models' performance is trained and tested with confined datasets, including the LUNA’16 dataset. The artificial neural network (ANN), radial neural network (RNN), learning vector quantization (LVQ), PSO-TSVM models are confined for comparative classification study. Subsequently, global threshold (GT), Chan-Vese level set method (CV-LSM), region growing (RG), K-means, and HECS models have been confined for segmentation comparative analysis. The performance is simulated on a desktop PC equipped with 64-bit Intel\circledR Core i7-10700 CPU@ 3.80 GHz times 16 and NVIDIA GeForce RTX3090 GPU and 64 GB RAM and Windows 10 Pro 64-bit operating system.

Table 1 illustrates the segmentation efficiency of the HECS model along with state-of-art models. Our HECS model has exceptional accuracy over pixel examination and even has an adequate rate due to the interrelation of pixel analysis mechanism in all confined factors. The affected tissue cells prediction ratio of global threshold (GT) is 76%, region growing (RG) is 67%, K-means 82%, Chan-Vese level set method (CV-LSM) is 88%, HECS is 95%, respectively. Therefore, GT, RG methods not meet the targeted accuracy in segmentation. Figure 3 illustrates the segmentation graphical analysis.

Four different factors like dice similarity (DS), Tanimoto (TN), TP, FP have been considered to assess the segmentation quality of our approach along with remaining approaches. If TN and DS values are nearer to 1, it indicates a significant segmentation rate.

Figures 6 and 7 show that the HECS model has prompted exhibition support against the abnormal CT_{i} dataset by 85% regarding the average precision mean of PSO-TSVM. The outcomes show the points of interest of utilizing the HECS model for anisotropic CT_{i} segmentation by deteriorating greyscale image without background greyscale image to learn intra-cut features. The error rate analysis remains low contrasted with the rest approaches by concentrating on high-resolution pixels in the HECS model along with the PSO-TSVM model, as can be observed in Fig. 7.

Conclusion
The designed suspicious volumetric tumor segmentation (SVTS) approach effectively identifies lung cancer with CT_{i}. An adaptive multiple resolution contour (AMRC) models is a primary part of the SVT segmentation mechanism, diminishing 45% computation complicity as the simulation outcomes are evident. The designed SVTS approach has been accomplished in two steps. The high-intensity-pixels edge centroid of SVT (HECS) efficiently identifies SVT location based on threshold values to justify the level set method (LSM) efficiency. The particle swarm optimisation (PSO) model regulates the twin support vector machine (TSVM) to accomplish adequate segmentation accuracy. The 1024 non-small lung tumor cells (NLTC) and 350 abnormal tissue (AT) tumors from the open-source tumor cancer maging archive (TCIA), 529 lung ATs from the lung image database consortium (LIDC) are fed to examine the performance of the SVTS approach. The NLTC dataset accomplished 73.19% average accuracy, the TCIA dataset has 76.21% average accuracy, and LIDC has 75.89% average accuracy. Our approach has a 98.3% precision rate and 0.27% error rate contrasted with state-of-the-art approaches. Hence, the simulation results of segmentation accuracy conclude that the TSVM-based SVTS approach has adequate impact and plays an essential role in classifying abnormal lungs data.
