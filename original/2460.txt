A lot of research has validated that zeroing neural network (ZNN) model is a reliable tool for solving time-varying problems. Generally, convergent performance is often one of the most important measures for the practicability of the ZNN model. Besides, its practicability is also up to its anti-noise ability in the process of solving time-varying problems. It is worth noting that numerous existing ZNN models perform well in terms of the above two issues. In order to further enhance the robustness and convergence of the ZNN model, two novel activation functions (novel activation function-1 (NAF-1) and novel activation function-2 (NAF-2)) are designed. Based on the above two NAFs, two robust ZNN models (zeroing neural network-1 (ZNN-1) and zeroing neural network-2 (ZNN-2)) with fixed time convergence and strong robustness to noise for solving time-varying Sylvester equation (TVSE) are proposed in this paper. The robustness and convergence of the two proposed ZNN models are verified by rigorous mathematical analysis, and their practicability are validated by three simulation experiments (second-order and third-order TVSE solving and manipulator trajectory tracking). All the studies indicate that the two ZNN models can quickly find the accurate solution of TVSE in noiseless and noisy environment.

Introduction
Sylvester equation is an important matrix equation in algebra, and it often arises in many scientific and engineering fields such as multiple-input multiple-output systems [1], the integration of high performance many-core graphics processing unit accelerators [2], acoustic source localization [3] and so on. Therefore, quickly and effectively finding the solution of Sylvester equation becomes increasing important. In the past, researchers mainly focused on solving static Sylvester equation with low dimensions via numerical iterative methods such as Bartels-Stewart [4, 5] and Hessenberg-Schur iteration method [6, 7]. The numerical iterative methods are generally effective for solving static Sylvester equation with low dimension. However, the computional complexity of the above numerical iterative methods is closely related to the dimension of the corresponding matrix, and with the increase of matrix dimension, the total number of iterations will also increase greatly.

Afterwards, with the development of computing ability of computers, the recurrent neural networks (RNN) which possesses the characteristics of parallel processing and easy hardware implementation are widely applied in time-varying problems solving [8,9,10]. As a typical type of RNN, the gradient-based neural network (GNN) developed rapidly in recent years, and it had been broadly used in high-dimensional Sylvester equation which is difficult to be handled by the numerical iterative methods [11, 12]. Nevertheless, in the process of extending this method to the solution of time-varying problems, researchers have gradually discovered its potential shortcomings. Specially, as the GNN model fails to make full use of the derivative information of the time-varying coefficient matrice in its construction process, the residual errors of the GNN model cannot converge to 0 when it is applied to solve time-varying problems, which indicates that GNN model is not a feasible method for time-varying problems solving.

Later on, Zhang et al. proposed another classic RNN model (namely ZNN model). The ZNN model is a powerful tool for time-varying problems solving, and it fixes the drawbacks of GNN model [13]. As soon as this method is introduced, it has attracted great attention of researchers all over the world. In addition, it is well known that convergence is very important for dynamic systems. For example, S. I. Abdelsalam et al. considered the convergence effect of the algorithm in the study of fluid peristalsis [14,15,16]. Particularly, in ref. [14], they carried out a detailed theoretical analysis on the velocity, temperature, concentration and movement density of microorganisms by using homotopic method. And then, in order to demonstrate the reliability of this method, the convergence of this method is detaily analyzed and discussed. Similarly, as a pioneering achievement for time-varying problem solving, a lot of continuous expansion and development on the convergence and robustness of the ZNN model have been reported [17,18,19].

The convergence of dynamic system has experienced asymptotic convergence, exponential convergence, finite-time convergence and fixed-time convergence. As early as 1999, through the research on feedforward neural network, it was pointed out that the selection of different activation functions (AF) would eventually lead to the diversity about the solving effect of the neural network model [20]. Therefore, various new AFs have been proposed for optimizing the convergence of the ZNN model. At first, some AFs such as linear activation function [21], power-sum activation function [22] and power-sigmoid activation function [23] were designed to construct the ZNN model. The ZNN model activated by the above AFs achieve exponential convergence in the process of solving time-varying problems. However, the convergent time of exponential convergence is uncertain and infinite, which imposes a great limitation on the practical application of the model. To overcome the limitation, the sign-bi-power activation function (SBPAF) [24], modified sign-bi-power activation function [25] and tunable activation function [26] were proposed, and the ZNN model activated by these AFs realizes finite time convergence. But it is well known that finite time convergence depends on the initial state of dynamic system, and system initial state is unknown in many cases, which results unpredictable convergent time of the finite time convergence system. Soon afterwards, fixed time convergence ZNN models were proposed to deal with the constraint of the finite time convergence system. Specifically, Xiao et al. made a detailed analysis of finite time convergence and fixed time convergence [27].

Moreover, it is worth pointing out that noise tolerant ability is another important performance metrics of dynamic systems [28,29,30]. Noises are inevitable in reality, which will largely decrease the accuracy of dynamic system in problems solving. As a consequence, the ZNN model which only consider the convergence whereas ignore the robustness are hard to be applied to practical problems. To obtain the noise resisting ability, the PID control method is adopted. In other words, as introduced in the control principle, the integral has a certain adjustability and it can remove the steady-state errors of the system so as to improve the robustness of the corresponding system. Motivated by it, the integration-enhanced Zhang neural network (IEZNN) is designed to remove the influence of noise that has been overlooked by the original ZNN (OZNN) model [31, 32]. However, the IEZNN model only achieves exponential convergence rather than finite time convergence or fixed-time convergence. Then, other ZNN models with both of finite time convergence and robustness are proposed [33,34,35]. More importantly, the versatile activation function (VAF)-based ZNN model is designed to guarantee its fixed time convergence and robustness simultaneously [36,37,38].

On the basis of the existing AFs, two new nonlinear NAFs (NAF-1 and NAF-2) based ZNN models (ZNN-1 and ZNN-2) with both of fixed-time convergence and anti-disturbance characteristics are proposed, which further enhances the practical application ability of the ZNN model. Moreover, it is worth emphasizing that the proposed ZNN-1 model has sensitive convergent speed adjustability. The fixed time convergence and noise tolerance of the proposed new models for solving TVSE problem are verified by strict theoretical analysis in various scenarios (noisy and noiseless environment). Besides, comparative simulation results of the proposed ZNN-1 and ZNN-2 models with other recently reported existing ZNN models for second-order TVSE (SOTVSE) and third-order TVSE (TOTVSE) solving and robotic manipulator trajectory tracking under various conditions further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed new models.

The rest of the paper consists of five sections. Section 2 introduces the problem formulation of TVSE and the basic mathematical knowledge. In Sect. 3, the design process of the original ZNN (OZNN) and the proposed ZNN-1 and ZNN-2 models are described in detail. In Sect. 4, the reliable fixed-time convergence and robustness of the proposed ZNN-1 and ZNN-2 models are analyzed theoretically. In Sect. 5, three numerical simulation experiments for SOTVSE and TOTVSE solving and manipulator trajectory tracking are provided to further validate the superior convergence and robustness of ZNN-1 and ZNN-2 models. In Sect. 6, the main work of this paper is comprehensively summarized. At the end of this section, we briefly summarize the contribution of this work as follows.

Problem formulation
Time-varying Sylvester equation (TVSE)
The TVSE needs to be solved in this work is shown as follows.

ùê¥(ùë°)ùëã(ùë°)‚àíùëã(ùë°)ùêµ(ùë°)=‚àíùê∂(ùë°)‚àà‚Ñùùëõ√óùëõ
(1)
where ùë°‚àà[ùë°0,ùë°ùëì] stands for time, ùë°0 and ùë°ùëì represent the starting and ending time of the equation solution, respectively. In addition, A(t), B(t) and C(t) denote the known dynamic coefficient matrices, while X(t) is the unknown matrix to be solved. The main purpose of this work is to use the proposed ZNN-1 and ZNN-2 models to solve Eq.(1) within fixed time in noiseless and noisy environment.

Here, we assume Eq. (1) is solvable, and it only has one unique solution at any time. It is worth mentioning that this requirement is guaranteed in the second section of ref. [39]. Specifically, it is demanded that A(t) and B(t) do not have the same eigenvalue.

Mathematical preparation
The following lemma 1 and theorem 1 are provided in advance to facilitate the analysis in Sect. 4.

Lemma 1
([40,41,42]) Suppose there is a non-static system as shown below.

ùë•Àô(ùë°)=ùëì(ùë•(ùë°),ùë°),ùë°‚àà[0,+‚àû)
(2)
If the continuous radial unbounded function U(x) satisfies the condition ùëà(ùë§)=0, and each solution of w(t) satisfies the following inequality.

ùëàÀô(ùë°)‚â§‚àí(ùëéùëàùëù(ùë§(ùë°))+ùëèùëàùëû(ùë§(ùë°)))ùúÄ
(3)
where a, b, p, q, ùúÄ>0 and ùëùùúÄ>1, ùëûùúÄ<1.

In this case, system (2) is fixed-time stable, and the upper bound of its convergent time can be directly written as follows:

ùëáùëöùëéùë•‚â§1ùëéùúÄ(ùëùùúÄ‚àí1)+1ùëèùúÄ(1‚àíùëûùúÄ)
Theorem 1
Suppose there exists a dynamic system below.

ùë¢Àô=ùëèùë¢‚àíùëêùë¢ùëü1‚àíùëëùë¢ùëü2,ùë¢(0)=ùë¢0
(4)
where b, c, d, ùëü1, ùëü2 and ùëü1<1, ùëü2>1, ùëê>ùëè, ùëë>ùëè. Then, the above system is fixed-time stable, and the upper bound of its convergent time can be obtained below.

ùë°ùëìùëñùë•<1(ùëë‚àíùëè)(ùëü2‚àí1)+11‚àíùëü11ùëèln|ùëêùëê‚àíùëè|
The detailed proof of theorem 1 is presented in the appendix section.

Original ZNN (OZNN) and the proposed ZNN models
As the proposed ZNN models (ZNN-1 and ZNN-2) are developed on the basis of the OZNN model, the construction process of the OZNN model is provided. Then, two corresponding new models are presented in this section.

OZNN model
The following three steps are taken in sequence to present the concrete structure of the OZNN model.

Step 1

Define a time-varying error function E(t).

ùê∏(ùë°)=ùê¥(ùë°)ùëã(ùë°)‚àíùëã(ùë°)ùêµ(ùë°)+ùê∂(ùë°)‚àà‚Ñùùëõ√óùëõ
(5)
Based on Eq.(5) , it can be found that solving Eq. (1) is consistent with enforcing E (t) converging to 0. That is, the value of X(t) is the solution of Eq. (1) when ùê∏(ùë°)=0 [43, 44].

Step 2 The following evolution formula is constructed to enforce ùê∏(ùë°)=0.

ùëë(ùê∏(ùë°))ùëë(ùë°)=‚àíùúÇùêª(ùê∏(ùë°))
(6)
where ùúÇ>0 and its value will directly affect the convergent speed of the ZNN model. ùêª(‚ãÖ) stands for the activation function array.

Step 3

Finally, by combining Eqs. (5) and (6), the OZNN model (7) can be deduced below.

ùê¥(ùë°)ùëãÀô(ùë°)‚àíùëãÀô(ùë°)ùêµ(ùë°)=‚àíùê¥Àô(ùë°)ùëã(ùë°)+ùëã(ùë°)ùêµÀô(ùë°)‚àíùê∂Àô(ùë°)‚àíùúÇùêª(ùê¥(ùë°)ùëã(ùë°)‚àíùëã(ùë°)ùêµ(ùë°)+ùê∂(ùë°))
(7)
Activation functions (AF)
Summary and comparison of existing AFs
Based on the construction of the above OZNN model, it can be observed that the AF ùêª(‚ãÖ) is an important component of ZNN model. As mentioned in the introduction section, AF is closely related to the convergence of the ZNN model, and various AFs have been proposed for optimizing its convergence. The existing AFs in Table 2 are discussed and summarized to better highlight the uniqueness of our proposed AFs.

The ZNN model activated by LAF, PAF, BPAF, PSAF and HSAF in Table 1 achieves exponential convergence. As the limitation of exponential convergence in practical application, SBPAF was proposed later. The ZNN model activated by the SBPAF realizes finite time convergence. But, finite time convergent model always depends on the system initial state, then, other AFs for realizing fixed time convergent ZNN model are proposed. However, the ZNN model activated by all the above AFs does not consider the robustness of the model. Subsequently, the VAFs (VAF1, VAF2, VAF3) are proposed for the ZNN model to guarantee its fixed-time convergence and avoid the harm of noises.

NAF-1 and NAF-2
To continuously enhance the practicability of the ZNN model, two NAFs (NAF-1 and NAF-2) are designed on the basis of the existing AFs in Table 1. Specifically, the proposed NAF-1 is the extension of VAF2 (with exponential convergence characteristic) and VAF3 (with adjustable parameter k), and the proposed NAF-2 is derived from VAF1 with simpler structure.

(1)
NAF-1

ùëõ1(ùë•)=(ùõº1|ùë•|ùúå+ùõº2|ùë•|ùúë)ùë†sgn(ùë•)+ùõº4sgn(ùë•)+ùõº3exp(|ùë•|ùúÜ)|ùë•|1‚àíùúÜsgn(ùë•)/ùúÜ
(8)
where 0<ùúÜ<1,ùõº1,ùõº2,ùõº3,ùõº4,ùúå,ùúë,ùë†>0,ùúåùë†>1,ùúëùë†<1.

(2)
NAF-2

ùëõ2(ùë•)=(ùõΩ1|ùë•|ùúÉ+ùõΩ2|ùë•|ùëò)sgn(ùë•)+ùõΩ3ùë•
(9)
where ùõΩ1,ùõΩ2>0,ùõΩ3>0,0<ùúÉ<1,ùëò>1.

Similar to the construction process of OZNN model, the above two NAFs are respectively substituted into Eq. (7). Then, the following two ZNN models (ZNN-1 and ZNN-2) can be obtained. In addition, it should be noted that the noise is also considered in these two new models.

(1)
ZNN-1

ùê¥(ùë°)ùëãÀô(ùë°)‚àíùëãÀô(ùë°)ùêµ(ùë°)=‚àíùê¥Àô(ùë°)ùëã(ùë°)+ùëã(ùë°)ùêµÀô(ùë°)‚àíùê∂Àô(ùë°)‚àíùúÇùëÅ1(ùê¥(ùë°)ùëã(ùë°)‚àíùëã(ùë°)ùêµ(ùë°)+ùê∂(ùë°))+ùê∑(ùë°)
(10)
(2)
ZNN-2

ùê¥(ùë°)ùëãÀô(ùë°)‚àíùëãÀô(ùë°)ùêµ(ùë°)=‚àíùê¥Àô(ùë°)ùëã(ùë°)+ùëã(ùë°)ùêµÀô(ùë°)‚àíùê∂Àô(ùë°)‚àíùúÇùëÅ2(ùê¥(ùë°)ùëã(ùë°)‚àíùëã(ùë°)ùêµ(ùë°)+ùê∂(ùë°))+ùê∑(ùë°)
(11)
where the parameters and matrices are the same as those defined earlier. D(t) is the noise matrix, and ùëëùëñùëó(ùë°) stands for the ijth element of D(t).

As mentioned above, noises are inevitable in reality, and the robustness of dynamic systems should be considered. Therefore, various noises are considered in our theoretical discussion and simulation experiments to validate the robustness of the proposed ZNN models. Besides, the noises considered in our theoretical discussions and simulation experiments are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2 Noises

The effectiveness and robustness of the above two models will be verified through theoretical analysis as well as simulation experiments in the following sections.

Comprehensive theoretical analysis of the proposed ZNN-1 and ZNN-2 models
Inspired by the proof of the ZNN model for solving time-varying linear equations in [36,37,38], the analysis of ZNN-1 and ZNN-2 models for solving TVSE in noiseless and noisy environment is provided in this section.

Theoretical analysis of ZNN -1
Ideal environment without noise
The following theorem 2 ensures the fixed-time stability of ZNN-1 (10) in ideal no noise environment (ùê∑(ùë°)=0 in Eq. (10)).

Theorem 2
Suppose the solution of Eq. (1) exists, the neural state solution X(t) of ZNN-1 model (10) will converge to the theoretical solution of Eq. (1) in fixed-time ùë°ùëö independent on the system initial state X(0).

ùë°ùëö‚â§1ùúÇùõºùë†1(ùúåùë†‚àí1)+1ùúÇùõºùë†2(1‚àíùúëùë†)
where ùõº1,ùõº2,ùúÇ,ùë†,ùúå,ùúë>0 and ùúåùë†>1,ùúëùë†<1.

Proof
On the basis of the construction step 2 of the ZNN model, it can be clearly seen that as long as the evolution formula is proved to be fixed-time convergent, the newly constructed ZNN-1 model (10) are also fixed time convergence, therefore, the following detailed proof is provided.

Considering the evolution formula consists of ùëõ2 subsystems, so its ijth subsystems is presented below. There is no doubt that as long as the subsystem is fixed-time convergent, then the ZNN-1model (10) is fixed time stable.

ùëíÀôùëñùëó(ùë°)=‚àíùúÇùëõ1(ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)) with ùëñ,ùëó‚àà{1,2,‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,ùëõ}
Here, we choose the Lyapunov function ùëö(ùë°)=|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)| to prove the fixed time convergence of ZNN-1 model (10).

By substituting the evolution formula and the NAF-1 (8) into the derivative of m(t), the following inequality can be obtained.

ùëöÀô(ùë°)=ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)ùë†ùëîùëõ(ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°))=‚àíùúÇùëõ1(ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°))sgn(ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°))=‚àíùúÇ(ùõº1|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|ùúå+ùõº2|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|ùúë)ùë†+ùõº3+ùõº4exp(|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|ùúÜ)|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|1‚àíùúÜ/ùúÜ‚â§‚àíùúÇ(ùõº1|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|ùúå+ùõº2|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|ùúë)ùë†=‚àí[ùúÇ1ùë†(ùõº1|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|ùúå+ùõº2|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|ùúë)]ùë†=‚àí(ùúÇ1ùë†ùõº1ùëöùúå+ùúÇ1ùë†ùõº2ùëöùúë))ùë†
(12)
According to Lemma 1, it is obvious that the convergent time of the ijth subsystem ùë°ùëù can be obtained.

ùë°ùëù‚â§1ùúÇùõºùë†1(ùúåùë†‚àí1)+1ùúÇùõºùë†2(1‚àíùúëùë†)
Then, the upper bound convergent time ùë°ùëö of ZNN-1 model for solving TVSE is

ùë°ùëö=ùëöùëéùë•(ùë°ùëù)‚â§1ùúÇùõºùë†1(ùúåùë†‚àí1)+1ùúÇùõºùë†2(1‚àíùúëùë†)
The proof of theorem 2 is completed. ‚óª

In noisy environment
It is no doubt that noises are inevitable in reality. As a result, to present the robustness of the ZNN-1 model, the fixed-time convergence of the proposed ZNN-1 model in noise polluted environment are considered in this subsection.

(1)
Time varying bounded vanishing noise (TVBVN)

When the additional noise in Eq. (10) is TVBVN (such as ùëë(ùë°)=0.1ùëí‚àí0.1ùë°, the following theorem 3 is given to guarantee the fixed-time stability of ZNN-1.

Theorem 3
Assume there exists the TVBVN D(t), and its ijth element satisfies |ùëëùëñùëó(ùë°)|‚â§ùõø|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)| . Where ùëíùëñùëó stands for the ijth item of the error function E(t) and 0<ùõø<(ùúÇùõº3ùëí)/ùúÜ. Then, ZNN-1 model (10) can solve TVSE (1) in fixed time ùë°ùëö independent on the system initial state X(0) even if it is polluted by TVBVN D(t).

ùë°ùëö‚â§1ùúÇùõºùë†1(ùúåùë†‚àí1)+1ùúÇùõºùë†2(1‚àíùúëùë†)
where ùõº1,ùõº2,ùúÇ,ùë†,ùúå,ùúë>0 and ùúåùë†>1,ùúëùë†<1.

Proof
By analogy with the proof of theorem 2, the evolution formula in the presence of noise can be obtained below.

ùëíÀôùëñùëó(ùë°)=‚àíùúÇùëõ1(ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°))+ùëëùëñùëó(ùë°) with ùëñ,ùëó‚àà{1,2,‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,ùëõ}
Then, ùëö(ùë°)=|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|2 is adopted as the Lyapunov function for the following theoretical proof.

First of all, the derivative of m(t) can be presented below.

Let ùëû=|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|ùúÜ, and then we can get the simplified ùë§(ùë°)=ùë§(ùëû)=(ùúÇùõº4ùëíùëû)/(ùúÜùëû).

The derivative of w(t) is shown below.

Owing to ùõø<(ùúÇùõº3ùëí)/ùúÜ, it is clear that ùëì(ùë°)<0 is always satisfied, and the above inequality (13) can be further transformed to the following form.

Time-varying bounded nonvanishing noise (TVBNN)

When the additional noise D(t) in Eq. (10) is TVBNN (such as ùëë(ùë°)=cos(ùë°), the following theorem 4 is provided to ensure the fixed-time stability of ZNN-1.

Theorem 4
Assume there exists the TVBNN D(t), and its ijth element satisfies |ùëëùëñùëó(ùë°)|‚â§ùõø, where 0<ùõø<ùúÜùõº4. Then, ZNN-1 model (10) can solve TVSE (1) in fixed time ùë°ùëö independent on the system initial state X(0) even if it is polluted by TVBNN D(t).

(3)
Time-varying mixed random noise (TVMRN) When the MRN (such as ùëë(ùë°)=0.2sin(0.01ùë°)+0.1+0.002ùë°2) is considered, the following theorem 5 is applied to ensure the fixed time convergence of ZNN-1.

Theorem 5
If there exists the TVMRN D(t), and its ijth element satisfies |ùëëùëñùëó(ùë°)|‚â§ùõø|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|, Where ùëíùëñùëó stands for the ijth item of the error function E(t) and 0<ùõø<(ùúÇùõº3ùëí)/ùúÜ. Then, ZNN-1 model (10) can solve TVSE (1) in fixed time ùë°ùëö independent on the system initial state X(0) even if it is polluted byTVMRN D(t).

Proof
In this case, we still choose ùëö(ùë°)=|ùëíùëñùëó|2 as the Lyapunov function to further prove the fixed-time convergence of the ZNN-1 model. The derivative of m(t) is presented below.

Again, the following equivalent substitution in terms of Z(t) is adopted.

ùëç(ùë°)=2ùõø|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|2‚àí(2ùúÇùõº4/)exp(|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|ùúÜ)|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|2‚àíùúÜ
Similar to theorem 3, it is easy to prove ùëç(ùë°)<0, and the above Eq. (15) can be further simplified into the following form.

The proof of theorem 5 is completed. ‚óª

Theoretical analysis of ZNN -2
To be capable of revealing the benefits of ZNN-2 model, a range of theoretical analysis will be given in the second half of this chapter.

Ideal noiseless environment
The following theorem 6 ensures the fixed-time stability of ZNN-2 (11) in ideal no noise environment (ùê∑(ùë°)=0).

Theorem 6
Assume the solution of Eq(1) exists and the relevant parameters satisfy ùõΩ3<ùõΩ1, ùõΩ3<ùõΩ2. Then, ZNN-2 model (11) can solve the TVSE (1) whatever the initial state X(0) is. Besides, the required fixed-time convergent time is shown as follows.

ùë°ùëìùëñùë•<1ùúÇ(ùõΩ2+ùõΩ3)(ùëò‚àí1)‚àí1ùõΩ3(1‚àíùúÉ)ln|ùõΩ1ùõΩ1+ùõΩ3|
where ùõΩ1,ùõΩ2>0,ùõΩ3>0,0<ùúÉ<1,ùëò>1.

Proof
When TVSE is solved with ZNN-2, the ijth subsystem of the corresponding evolution formula is shown as follows.

ùëíÀôùëñùëó(ùë°)=‚àíùúÇùëõ2(ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)) with ùëñ,ùëó‚àà{1,2‚Ä¶,ùëõ}
We choose the Lyapunov function candidate ùëö(ùë°)=|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)| to complete the proof of fixed-time convergence of ZNN-2. Substituting NAF-2 (9) into the above equation, the derivative of m(t) can be obtained.

ùëöÀô(ùë°)=ùëíÀôùëñùëó(ùë°)sgn(ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°))=‚àíùúÇn2(eùëñùëó(ùë°))sgn(ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°))=‚àíùúÇ(ùõΩ1|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|ùúÉ+ùõΩ2|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|ùëò+ùõΩ3|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|)=‚àíùúÇùõΩ3ùëö(ùë°)‚àíùúÇùõΩ1ùëöùúÉ(ùë°)‚àíùúÇùõΩ2ùëöùëò(ùë°)

According to theorem 1, the predefined convergent time ùë°ùëì of the ijth subsystem of ZNN-2 is shown below.

Then, the upper bound convergent time ùë°ùëìùëñùë• of ZNN-2 model for solving TVSE in ideal noiseless environment is

In noisy environment
Similar to the above theoretical discussion on the ZNN-1 model, the following subsection also considers the reliability of the ZNN-2 model in various noises polluted environment.

(1)
Time-varying unbounded non-vanishing noise (TVUNVN)

When there is TVNVN (e.g., ùê∑(ùë°)=0.01ùë°), the following theorem 7 guarantees the fixed time convergence of the ZNN-2 model for solving TVSE (1).

Theorem 7
If there exists the TVNVN D(t), and its ijth element satisfies |ùëëùëñùëó(ùë°)|‚â§ùõø|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|, Where ùëíùëñùëó presents the ijth item of the error function E(t) and ùõø>0. Then, if the corresponding parameters satisfy ùõø>ùúÇùõΩ3,ùõø‚àíùúÇùõΩ3<ùúÇùõΩ1, ùõø‚àíùúÇùõΩ3<ùúÇùõΩ2, then, ZNN-2 model (11) also can find the solution of TVSE (1) in fixed time ùë°ùëìùëñùë• independent of the system initial state X(0) even if it is polluted by TVNVN D(t).

ùë°ùëìùëñùë•<1ùúÇùõΩ2‚àíùúé+ùúÇùõΩ3‚àí1(1‚àíùúÉ)(ùúé‚àíùúÇùõΩ3)ln|ùúÇùõΩ1ùúÇùõΩ1‚àíùúé+ùúÇùõΩ3|
where ùõΩ1,ùõΩ2>0,ùõΩ3>0,0<ùúÉ<1,ùëò>1.

Proof
The expression of the corresponding subsystem is shown below.

ùëíÀôùëñùëó(ùë°)=‚àíùúÇùëõ2(ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)+ùëëùëñùëó(ùë°)) with ùëñ,ùëó‚àà{1,2‚Ä¶,ùëõ}
The ùëö(ùë°)=|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)| is adopted as the Lyapunov function candidate, then the following equation can be obtained.

ùëöÀô(ùë°)=ùëíÀôùëñùëó(ùë°)sgn(ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°))=(‚àíùúÇùëõ2(ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°))+ùëëùëñùëó(ùë°))sgn(ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°))=‚àíùúÇ(ùõΩ1|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|ùúÉ+ùõΩ2|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|ùëò+ùõΩ3|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|)+ùúé|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|=(ùúé‚àíùúÇùõΩ3)|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|‚àíùúÇùõΩ1|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|ùúÉ‚àíùúÇùõΩ2|ùëíùëñùëó|ùëò=(ùúé‚àíùúÇùõΩ3)ùëö‚àíùúÇùõΩ1ùëöùúÉ‚àíùúÇùõΩ2ùëöùëò
(17)
On the basis of the theorem 1, it can be concluded that the convergent time ùë°ùëì of the ijth subsystem of ZNN-2 model is

ùë°ùëì<1ùúÇùõΩ2‚àíùúé+ùúÇùõΩ3‚àí1(1‚àíùúÉ)(ùúé‚àíùúÇùõΩ3)ln|ùúÇùõΩ1ùúÇùõΩ1‚àíùúé+ùúÇùõΩ3|
Then, the upper bound convergent time ùë°ùëìùëñùë• of ZNN-2 model for solving TVSE in TVNVN polluted environment is

The proof of theorem 7 is completed. ‚óª

Time-varying mixed random noise (TVMRN)

Assume there is TVMRN (such as ùê∑(ùë°)=0.5ùë†ùëñùëõ(0.1ùë°)+0.2) in dynamic system (11), the following theorem 8 ensures the predetermined time convergence of the ZNN-2 model (11).

Theorem 8
If there exists the TVMRN D(t) in dynamic system (11), and its ijth element satisfies |ùëëùëñùëó(ùë°)|‚â§ùõø|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|. Where the ùëíùëñùëó presents the ijth item of the error function E(t) and ùõø>0. Then, once the corresponding parameters satisfy ùõø>ùúÇùõΩ3, ùõø‚àíùúÇùõΩ3<ùúÇùõΩ1,ùõø‚àíùúÇùõΩ3<ùúÇùõΩ2, ZNN-2 model (11) can solve TVSE (1) independent of the system initial state X(0) even if disturbed by the TVMRN noise D(t).

ùë°ùëìùëñùë•<1ùúÇùõΩ2‚àíùúé+ùúÇùõΩ3‚àí1(1‚àíùúÉ)(ùúé‚àíùúÇùõΩ3)ln|ùúÇùõΩ1ùúÇùõΩ1‚àíùúé+ùúÇùõΩ3|
where ùõΩ1,ùõΩ2>0,ùõΩ3>0,0<ùúÉ<1,ùëò>1.

Here, we still choose ùëö(ùë°)=ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°) as the Lyapunov function to prove the fixed-time convergence of ZNN-2, and the similar proof procedure with the above theorem 7 is provided.

ùëöÀô(ùë°)=ùëíÀôùëñùëó(ùë°)sgn(ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°))=(‚àíùúÇùëõ2(ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°))+ùëëùëñùëó(ùë°))sgn(ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°))=‚àíùúÇ(ùõΩ1|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|ùúÉ+ùõΩ2|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|ùëò+ùõΩ3|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|)+ùúé|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|=(ùúé‚àíùúÇùõΩ3)|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|‚àíùúÇùõΩ1|ùëíùëñùëó(ùë°)|ùúÉ‚àíùúÇùõΩ2|ùëíùëñùëó|ùëò=(ùúé‚àíùúÇùõΩ3)ùëö‚àíùúÇùõΩ1ùëöùúÉ‚àíùúÇùõΩ2ùëöùëò
(18)
Then, according to theorem 1, the convergent time ùë°ùëì of the ijth subsystem of ZNN-2 model can be written as follows.

ùë°ùëì<1ùúÇùõΩ2‚àíùúé+ùúÇùõΩ3‚àí1(1‚àíùúÉ)(ùúé‚àíùúÇùõΩ3)ln|ùúÇùõΩ1ùúÇùõΩ1‚àíùúé+ùúÇùõΩ3|
Then, the upper bound convergent time ùë°fix of ZNN-2 model for solving TVSE in TVMRN polluted environment can be obtained below.

Simulation results
To further validate the advantages of ZNN-1 and ZNN-2 for solving time-varying problems, several comparative simulations under various circumstances based on the above theoretical analysis are provided in this section. In addition, the following two explanations are presented in advance to facilitate our analysis.

(1)
In the simulated transient solution Figures, the red dotted curves represent the theoretical solution of TVSE (1), and the solid blue curves represent the neural state solution of TVSE (1) generated by the ZNN models. Obviously, the criterion to measure the effectiveness of the models is the coincidence degree of the blue solid curves and the red dotted curves.

It has been proved that the convergence rate of ZNN model is limited by the parameterùúÇ, and the large value of the parameter ùúÇ will result in a reduction of the convergent time [45]. In order to ensure fair comparability between the simulation results, we uniformly set the parameter ùúÇ=1.

Example 1: Second-order time-varying Sylvester equation (SOTVSE) solving
In order to show the fixed-time convergence and noise tolerant property of the ZNN-1 and ZNN-2 models activated by NAF-1 and NAF-2, comparative simulation results of the two new proposed ZNN models with OZNN models activated by LAF, PSAF and SBPAF are all used to solve SOTVSE (1) with the following time-varying coefficient matrices.

ùê¥(ùë°)=(sin(3ùë°)‚àícos(3ùë°)cos(3ùë°)sin(3ùë°)),ùêµ(ùë°)=(2003),ùê∂(ùë°)=(ùë†ùëñùëõ(4ùë°)‚àíùëêùëúùë†(4ùë°)ùëêùëúùë†(4ùë°)sin(4ùë°))
In addition, three types of noises are taken into account in the following simulations to validate the robustness and effectiveness of the models.

The first considered noise is the DUNVN D(t) with its ijth element ùëë(ùë°)=0.01ùë°, and the corresponding simulation results of the proposed new models and OZNN models activated by LAF, PSAF and SBPAF for solving SOTVSE (1) with the above time-varying coefficient matrices in DUNVN D(t) polluted environment are presented in Fig.1. Besides, it is necessary to note that the parameter s in NAF-1 (8) are respectively set to be 0.25, 1, and 4 to demonstrate the characteristic of adjustable convergent speed of the proposed ZNN-1 model which is rarely reported in other OZNN models.

As can be observed in Fig.1, the residual errors ||ùê∏(ùë°)|| of proposed ZNN-1 model and ZNN-2 model all quickly converge to 0. Specially, the residual error of ZNN-1 model spends about 0.1s and ZNN-2 takes 0.5s. While the residual errors of the OZNN model activated by LAF, PSAF and SBPAF could not converge to 0, which indicates that the proposed ZNN-1 model and the ZNN-2 models successfully find the solution of the SOTVSE (1) in DUNVN ùê∑(ùë°)=0.01ùë° polluted environment, but other OZNN models fail at this time. The above comparative simulation experiments verify that the proposed ZNN-1 and the ZNN-2 model have better predefined time convergence and robustness than the other existing models.

Besides, by comparing the three blue solid curves in the above three subgraphs, it can be found that the time which the blue curve converges to 0 becomes shorter and shorter with the increase of parameter s. That‚Äôs to say, under the same conditions, the convergent time of ZNN-1 model for solving SOTVSE (1) could be shortened by increasing the value of s.

When there exists the TVBDN ùê∑(ùë°)=0.1ùëí‚àí0.1ùë°, the simulation results of the proposed ZNN-1 and ZNN-2 models and the OZNN model activated by LAF, PSAF and SBPAF for solving the above SOTVSE (1) are presented in Fig. 2.

As can be observed in Fig. 2a and b, the blue solid curves quickly coincide with the red dashed curves, which indicates the neural state solutions of ZNN-1 and ZNN-2 can converge quickly to the theoretical solution of SOTVSE(1). Moreover, the residual errors of ZNN-1, ZNN-2 and OZNN model activated by LAF, PSAF and SBPAF for solving SOTVSE (1) under the interference of ùê∑(ùë°)=0.1ùëí‚àí0.1ùë° is shown in Fig.2 (c). Obviously, the residual errors of ZNN-1 and ZNN-2 converge to 0 quickly. Specifically, the convergent time of ZNN-1 is about 0.1s and ZNN-2 model is 0.8s. However, the residual errors of other models cannot converge to 0, and they stay within a certain range and no longer attenuating. The above comparative simulation results validate the extraordinary convergence and anti-noise capacity of the proposed ZNN-1 and ZNN-2 models.

Finally, the more complex TVMRN ùê∑(ùë°)=2ùë°+0.2 is considered, and the residual errors of ZNN-1, ZNN-2 and OZNN model activated by LAF, PSAF and SBPAF for solving SOTVSE (1) in TVMRN polluted environment are presented in Fig. 3.

It can be intuitively observed in Fig. 3 that the residual errors of ZNN-1 and ZNN-2 reduce to 0 within about 0.1s and 0.55s respectively under the influence of TVMRN ùê∑(ùë°)=2ùë°+0.2, while the residual errors of the OZNN model activated by LAF, PSAF and SBPAF fluctuate up and down, and they fail to converge to 0, which further validates the significant improvement of the proposed ZNN-1 and ZNN-2 models over other existing models.

In order to further validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed models for high dimensional time-varying matrix equation solving, the comparative simulation results of the ZNN-1 and ZNN-2 models with OZNN model activated by LAF, PSAF and SBPAF for solving third order time-varying Sylvester equation (TOTVSE) with various noises are presented in the following example 2.

Example 2: Third-order time-varying Sylvester equation (TOTVSE) solving
In this subsection, the TOTVSE with the following coefficient matrice involved in the simulation experiment is considered.

ùê¥(ùë°)=ùê∂(ùë°)=‚éõ‚éù‚éú‚éúsin(3ùë°)‚àícos(ùë°)‚àísin(ùë°)cos(3ùë°)ùë†ùëñùëõ(3ùë°)‚àícos(2ùë°)sin(ùë°)cos(ùë°)sin(3ùë°)‚éû‚é†‚éü‚éü,ùêµ(ùë°)=‚éõ‚éù‚éú‚éú20000301510020‚éû‚é†‚éü‚éü,‚éõ‚éù‚éú‚éúsin(3ùë°)‚àícos(ùë°)sin(ùë°)cos(3ùë°)sin(3ùë°)cos(ùë°)sin(ùë°)cos(ùë°)sin(3ùë°)‚éû‚é†‚éü‚éü
Firstly, the influences of the constant noise ùê∑(ùë°)=0.5 on the solution of TOTVSE by using ZNN-1, OZNN model activated by LAF, PSAF and SBPAF are shown in Fig. 4. In addition, similar to Example 1, three subgraphs under different parameter s in NAF-1 (8) are taken into account to verify the convergent speed adjustability of the proposed ZNN-1 model.

Full size image
As shown in Fig.4, the proposed ZNN-1 obtains the exact solution of the above TOTVSE (1) quickly under the influence of constant noise ùê∑(ùë°)=0.5. But the OZNN model activated by LAF, PSAF and SBPAF fail, and their residual errors cannot converge to 0.The comparative simulation results indicate that the proposed ZNN-1 model achieve a more satisfactory convergence performance and noise tolerant ability than the existing OZNN models. Besides, through the specific analysis of the residual errors generated by the ZNN-1 model with different parameters s, we can again draw the conclusion that the larger the variable parameter s is, the higher the convergence speed of ZNN-1 model will be. Specifically, it can be observed in Fig.(c), the residual error of the proposed ZNN-1 model only spends about 0.3s to converge to 0, while ZNN-1 model takes almost sextuple and quadruple time, respectively, to achieve the same purpose in Fig.(a) and Fig.(b).

What‚Äôs more, the two situations of complex TVMRNs ùê∑(ùë°)=0.2sin(0.01ùë°)+0.1+0.002ùë°2 and ùê∑(ùë°)=0.5sin(0.1ùë°)+0.2) are also considered to further validate the robustness and effectiveness of the models for solving TOTVSE (1). The simulation results are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 below.

Full size image
As can be seen from Fig. 5a, the blue solid curves coincide with the red dashed curves very quickly. Besides, based on Fig. 5b, it is clear that the residual error generated by ZNN-1 converges to 0 within 0.3s, and the residual errors of OZNN model activated by LAF, PSAF and SBPAF are unable to reach 0. On the basis of above analysis, it can be known that the residual error of ZNN-1 decreases to zero in a very short time, and its transient neural state solution quickly converges to the theoretical solution of TOTVSE (1) in TVMRN ùê∑(ùë°)=0.2sin(0.01ùë°)+0.1+0.002ùë°2 polluted environment. Therefore, the proposed ZNN-1 model has significant improvements in terms of the convergent speed and noise tolerance ability compared with some existing OZNN models.

Based on the above Fig. 6a, it is obvious that the convergent speed of ZNN-2 is very satisfactory. Moreover, it can also be observed specifically that the OZNN model activated by LAF, PSAF and SBPAF are difficult to solve the TOTVSE in the TVMRN ùê∑(ùë°)=0.5sin(0.1ùë°)+0.2 polluted environment. specifically, on the basis of Fig. 6b, it is clear that the residual error of ZNN-1 model spends about 0.7s to converge to 0, while the residual error of the other models remain at a nonzero position, which indicates that the proposed ZNN-2 model also has more conspicuous robustness and convergence than the existing OZNN models.

The above two numerical simulation experiments further validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed models for high dimensional time-varying matrix equation solving in various environment. Additionally, to emphasize the practicability of the proposed new models, the simulation results of trajectory tracking of robotic manipulator using them are considered in the following subsection.

Example 3: Robotic manipulator trajectory tracking application
With the development of artificial intelligence, robots are widely used in machine manufacturing [46], fire extinguishing [47], architectural design [48] and so on. As one of the key development directions of the robots, robotic manipulator trajectory tracking becomes a hot spot in recent years [49,50,51,52,53].

Therefore, in order to show the practical value of the proposed ZNN-1 and ZNN-2 models, they are used to control the robotic manipulator for trajectory tracking under the perturbation of time-varying periodic noise ùê∑(ùë°)=cos(ùë°) in this subsection. Furthermore, the OZNN model activated by SBPAF is also used to complete the same robotic manipulator tracking task under the same conditions for the purpose of comparison.

Generally, complex practical problems can be simplified to mathematical equation solving [54,55,56,57,58,59]. Similarly, in order to study the manipulator trajectory tracking, the kinematics equation of the mobile manipulator at the position level is introduced in ref. [60].

ùëÖ(ùë°)=ùúâ(Œò(ùë°))
(19)
where R(t) is the position vector of the manipulator end-effector, ùúâ(‚ãÖ) is an nonlinear and differentiable mapping function and ùúÉ=[ùúë,ùúÉùëá]ùëá‚ààùëÖùëõ+2 is the joint angle of the manipulator which includes the angle vector and space vector.

Then, take derivative of the above position level equation, the following speed level kinematic equation is obtained.

ùëÖÀô(ùë°)=ùëä(ùúÉ)ŒòÀô(ùë°)
(20)
where ùëä(ùúÉ)=‚àÇùúâ(Œò)/‚àÇŒò stands for the Jacobian matrix.

It is worth notifying that ùëÖÀô(ùë°) is usually given in advance, and ŒòÀô(ùë°) needs to be solved. In order to successfully solve the above Eq. (20), the following ZNN-1-based model, ZNN-2-based model and OZNN-based model are constructed for the robotic manipulator trajectory tracking.

ùëä(Œò(ùë°))ŒòÀô=ùëÖÀô(ùë°)‚àíùúÜùëÅ1(ùëÖ(ùë°)‚àíùúâ(Œò(ùë°))+ùê∑(ùë°)

(23)
where ùëÅ1(‚ãÖ), ùëÅ2(‚ãÖ) and ùëÅ3(‚ãÖ) are NAF-1, NAF-2 and SBPAF, respectively. ùê∑(ùë°)=ùëêùëúùë†(ùë°) is the time-varying periotic noise.

The simulation results of the above three models for robotic manipulator trajectory tracking are shown in Figs. 7, 8, 9, 10.

Figures 7 and 8 are the manipulator trajectory tracking results of the OZNN-based model (23) and ZNN-1-based model (22) with periodic ùê∑(ùë°)=cos(t). It can be observed in Fig. 7, the manipulator controlled by the OZNN-based model (23) could not successfully complete the trajectory tracking task until the end of the simulation. As observed in Fig. 8, the manipulator controlled by the ZNN-1-based model (21) accurately moves along the pre-set honeybee path, and it completes the trajectory tracking task successfully.

Figures 9 and 10 are the manipulator trajectory tracking results of the OZNN-based model (23) and ZNN-2-based model (22) with periodic ùê∑(ùë°)=cos(ùë°). It can be observed in Fig.9, the manipulator controlled by the OZNN-based model (23) could not accurately track the pre-set double arc epicycloid path until the end of the simulation. However, as can be seen in Fig. 10, the manipulator controlled by ZNN-2-based model (22) can track the desired path accurately.

Based on the above analysis, it is clear that compared with the existing OZNN model, the proposed ZNN-1 and ZNN-2 models are the more trustworthy methods for solving practical time-varying problems due to their outstanding robustness and fixed time convergence.

Conclusion
In this paper, two ZNN models (ZNN-1 and ZNN-2) are proposed based on two new designed NAFs (NAF-1 and NAF-2). The robustness and convergence of the proposed new ZNN models are detailed analyzed through strict mathematical validation. In order to further verify the significant advantages of the new models, several comparative simulation experiments of the proposed new models with existing OZNN models are provided. Theoretical analysis and experiment both show that the proposed new models possess fixed time convergence and strong robustness to noise for time-varying problems solving. In addition, it is important to point out that the proposed ZNN-1 model has the convergent speed adjustability which is rarely reported in most of the existing OZNN models. Moreover, our future work will focus on solving time-varying problems with more complex noises and how to extend ZNN-1 and ZNN-2 models to the research field of complex value time-varying problems.
