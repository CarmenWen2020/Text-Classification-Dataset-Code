Automated continuous condition monitoring of industrial electrical machines to identify internal faults has become one of the critical research areas for the past decade. Among various defects, early-stage identification of insulation failure in stator winding is of notable demand as it often occurs and accounts for 37% of the overall motor failures. Identifying the current signature at its embryonic stage will effectively improve industrial machinery’s downtime and repair costs. Recent advances in computational performance and sensor technology concede advanced systems for achieving these goals. The design of an AI-based fault signature analyzer (FSA) has been developed in this paper. FSA uses real-time stator current data in the time and frequency domain from healthy and faulty induction motors to train the various AI-based machine learning classifiers to identify health conditions using wavelets. Comparing machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural network, random forest, fuzzy logic, neuro-fuzzy logic, K-nearest neighbors is performed, and various performance attributes are quantified. A reliable, automatic fault signature from a motor current is thus analyzed using the fusion of a wavelet-based feature extraction technique and a capable knowledge-based efficient artificial intelligence (AI) approach.

Introduction
Three-phase induction machines are primarily the workhorses of most manufacturing industries. Therefore, induction machines are vital electromechanical devices used for various applications ranging from fans to large-scale manufacturing [1]. The machine’s unstable operating conditions, such as a sudden load shift, misalignment, and insufficient maintenance, result in a shortened lifetime, inevitably leading to substantial monetary losses and inefficiencies. It is challenging to diagnose stator turn–turn fault in an industrial machine during its working condition, as unscheduled motor downtime causes losses in production. When a stator turn–turn failure occurs, very high currents flow in the short-circuited coil, causing isolation deterioration and fault dissemination. The stator turn–turn fault has an indistinct effect on the motor’s performance in the early stages. However, if not detected at its embryonic stage, it can result in phase-to-phase or phase-to-ground short-circuits’ fault. Faults are unacceptable and thus must be witnessed to prevent all these failures [2, 3].

According to the industry standard, most of the failures are introduced by the stator, rotor, and bearings. A similar survey was carried out by the IEEE Industrial Applications Society and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI); insulation failure in the stator winding accounts for more than 37% of overall industrial machines’ failures [4,5,6]. Therefore, the current research has designed and developed an AI-based FSA for the automated monitoring of stator winding insulation failures in the industrial system in real-time conditions. Preventive and corrective are primary aspects of conventional maintenance methods. Most manufacturing industries are currently dependent on preventive maintenance, which operates before a breakdown occurs. Data models are important for detecting and diagnosing faults to avoid machine failures. Most data-driven methods make use of Fourier transform, fast Fourier transform, short-time Fourier transform. Likewise, machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural network [7], random forest [8], fuzzy logic [9], neuro-fuzzy logic [10], K-nearest neighbor [11] for industrial machine health monitoring are observed. Fourier series, Fourier transforms, and fast Fourier transforms can only obtain information in one domain, i.e., on time or a frequency. From the experimental setup, it was found that when a stator winding insulation failure occurs, there is also a significant change in time and frequency components. Because of the scalability and translation of the stator current signal, frequency-time-based data-driven wavelet transforms are used over short-time Fourier transforms. Most of the works have centered either on the time domain or the frequency domain [12, 13]. However, only a few works based on the time-frequency diagnostic method identify the faults at early stage [14,15,16,17]. Such a few strategies adopted are complicated, expensive, and intrusive. Only a few works have centered on the time-frequency domain approach. Also, the proposed work has compared various machine learning algorithms to examine their real-time implementation possibility for hardware-in-the-loop or HIL. However, HIL is out of scope for this work but considered various assessment attributes for software-in-the-loop or SIL such as time, speed, and computational complexity. The algorithm checks the accuracy of three downs to stop the learning process for classifier models when performance in generalization decreases. This check has drastically reduced the computational complexity as it turned out to be a robust model to avoid unhidden iterations for no profit at the end. It helped in tuning parameters accordingly much before the iterations to be stopped.

The proposed AI-based fault signature analyzer or FSA for automatic real-time condition monitoring diagnostic approach, on the contrary, is most straightforward and cheapest compared to others, as the system is non-intrusive and needs only current sensors. The proposed work makes a novel contribution to identifying stator faults in their early stages, using a wavelet-based diagnostic approach to validate the time and frequency domain results altogether. Firstly, the stator turn–turn fault was introduced in induction motor I. The current and frequency signatures were extracted by integrating modular and virtual instruments. Consequently, the proposed algorithms were evaluated with different performance parameters such as the number of features, the number of epoch runs, activation functions, learning rate, model loss function, and accuracy. A more careful discussion has been made in the proposed work about theoretical and practical contributions. For example, the accuracy of the techniques used today in the literature as compared to solution proposed by the authors. Also, to compare the performance of this approach with other state-of-the-art solutions. Regardless of the size of the motors, the fault signature remains the same. The same phenomenon was performed on five motors of various sizes (2 Hp, 5 Hp, 10 Hp, 20 Hp, 50 Hp) and parameters [34]. However, the proposed work has used two three-phase star-connected squirrel cage induction motor. There are three datasets used for the classifier model: training, testing, and validation data. Training and testing data were used from induction motor-I and evaluation measure using induction motor-II.

Other failures such as bearing, inner and outside race, tooth split, rotor bar failure can apply to the proposed technique. These failures can be outlined entirely, and an adaptive integrated condition monitoring scheme will be implemented shortly. There will be a few other minor improvements in the modular and virtual instruments, such as the sampling rate of the acquired signal, the sensors to be used for any specific faults, and the testbed to particular faults, when considering any other faults than what is presented in this work. FSA can be applied to any industrial problem related to their health condition, provided they should meet specific requirements with a few limitations. For example, compressor or pump monitoring systems require data from pressure transmitter, flow meter, vibration sensors, bearing and winding temperatures, and energy meters. To apply FSA to these applications, the sampling rate at which data to be captured have to be analyzed to avoid any misidentification, selection of sensors, and data acquisition module should have a proper environment that is adequate shielding for the outer casing and operating temperature. A summary of fault detection and diagnosis methods from the literature in Table 1.

AI-based fault signature analyzer
The conventional fault detection and diagnostic techniques use various motor signals such as voltage [35], flux and instant power [21], vibration [22], acoustic signal [36], temperature [23], current signature, electromagnetic or mechanical torque for continuous automated monitoring [37]. Vibration analysis is one of the most popular methods used in industrial motor condition monitoring. The vibration technique takes data from an accelerometer (to measure the casing vibrations) and eddy current transducers that monitor the rotating shafts directly to measure the radial shaft displacement [38]. The main problem with vibration analysis is that it needs costly expertise in condition monitoring and relevant experience. The vibration data are prone to error due to its impulsive nature but performs better with a stationary signal. In temperature-based analysis, the temperature is used as an indicator for identifying faults using thermography techniques. Suppose electrical equipment works in healthy conditions for a longer period in severe conditions due to power requirements. In that case, the motor may recognize it as a failure due to the temperature difference, although the motor runs in a healthy condition.

Nevertheless, the stator current signature is used in practice due to its noninvasive nature [28, 39]. Various studies have shown that artificial neural network can identify patterns and the fault current signature compared to any other machine learning algorithms with a greater identification accuracy [40,41,42]. An artificial neural network is among the most widely used classifiers for fault diagnosis. Therefore, a reliable, automatic fault signature from a motor current is analyzed using a fusion of wavelet-based feature extraction technique with a knowledge-based artificial neural network is shown in Fig. 1.

The proposed methodology’s complete process is thoroughly examined to find faults at an early stage. The motor was first designed with a stator turn–turn fault. The current signature was acquired from both healthy and faulty induction motors and fed to the local controller to extract wavelet coefficients. The pattern recognition method uses feature extraction, selection of features, and classification techniques to recognize the fault signature. The extracted wavelet coefficients are then fed to the central controller through a ZigBee module wirelessly. As the next step, feature selection and classification were performed on the central controller, and the performance of each classifier model was evaluated. The fault signature analyzer uses stator current from both healthy and faulty three-phase induction motors to train the classifier models using a wavelet-based feature extraction along with a knowledge-based efficient AI technique. The numerical model’s first and third harmonics’ frequency and amplitude are taken from the resulting spectrum of the real sequence positive part. The ratio of the third and the first harmonics was known as an indication of fault. The stator turn–turn fault decision is made with a wavelet-based diagnostic strategy shown in Fig. 2. Since the FFT range is not usually fixed to the first harmonic part of the analyzed signal, a window function is used to process the FFT input. The window feature adds a smooth fade in and out, resulting in a better and consistent spectrum output.

When a stator turn-to-turn fault occurs, the three-phase parameters (say resistance in each phase, self-inductance, magnetizing inductance) are different for different motor phases. However, under faulty conditions, the phase currents are unequal, and also their phase shifts. The induction motor’s different phase currents both before and after the turn–turn short-circuit fault have been investigated. When a fault is detected in one of the three phases, the current that appears mainly in the corresponding phase increases to its peak value compared with other motor winding phases. Thus, it is clear that a turn–turn short-circuit fault affects the faulty phase’s stator current in peak value where the different stator phase currents have more negligible influences. FSA has considered harmonics to be constant throughout the analysis, i.e., 3𝑟𝑑 harmonic. The fault signature considered for identifying stator winding failure is irrespective of harmonic conditions. Therefore, the type and degree of the fault entirely depend on the fundamental frequency present alongside the fault conditions. A vital component of an artificially intelligent system is the ability to explain the decisions, recommendations, predictions, or actions and the process through which they are made. Intuitively, a justification explains why a decision is good, but it may or may not do so by explaining exactly how it was made. Unlike introspective explanations, justifications can be produced for non-interpretable systems. However, numerous works show from the literature section how a few machine learning models such as neural network, fuzzy/neuro-fuzzy logic, K-nearest neighbor, random forest are well known from past decades to identify failures in industrial machinery.

Random forest
Random forest is an ensemble algorithm that uses multiple decision tree algorithms to predict the output [43]. For example, it can train M various trees on different subsets of the data, randomly selected with replacement, and then compute the ensemble as f(x) ; where f m is the m’th tree.

𝑓(𝑥)=∑𝑚=1𝑀1𝑀𝑓𝑚(𝑥)

Random forest algorithm is made up of many decision trees which classify the data frame individually. Each decision tree classifies the same data into the training and test data according to its own best split (obtained for different sequences of a set of conditions applied for splitting). The following tree then classifies the same data and not the previous decision tree training data. The decision tree structure is obtained based on the Gini index values. Gini index is the calculation of variance from the precision of each node in the form of the decision tree. The root node has thus the lowest Gini index in the decision tree, and each subsequent node in the tree has lower Gini indexes. Each node in the tree diagram has four features. Gini represents the Gini index of that node in the tree. Samples represent the total number of training data considered for that node. Value is an array that represents the number of training data of each class for that particular node. The first feature is the basic condition on which that particular node is split. The 𝑖∗ for every X[i] shown in the tree of Fig. 3 is the index of the time statistical features for all the phase currents, and X[i] represents the training dataset column corresponding to the 𝑖𝑡ℎ index. The predicted accuracy for the random forest algorithm at 5𝑡ℎ tree is 84.2%

K-nearest neighbor
K-nearest neighbors are one of the most basic yet essential classification algorithms in machine learning. It is widely used in real scenarios as it is nonparametric. It does not take any predefined distribution for data—the relationship from the given labeled dataset between xand y. To find a function h: X→Y, for example, so that h(x) can confidently predict the corresponding output y given an unknown observation x. The K-nearest neighbor algorithm forms a majority vote among the most similar instances in the K to the new observation given [44].

A similarity between two data points is defined according to a distance metric. The distance metric is the Euclidean distance and thus given by 𝑑(𝑥,𝑥′) in Eq (16). The predicted accuracy for the KNN algorithm for K value equal ten is 83.6% shown in Fig. 4.

Neuro-fuzzy logic
Fuzzy logic or FL requires manual intervention for defining rules and membership functions. In contrast, the AI-based neuro-fuzzy logic or NFL can generate rules and membership functions independently with a given set of experimental data. The identification of faulty data is also performed by designing a suitable neuro-fuzzy system [45]. In fuzzy, membership functions and rules should be provided to make decisions and predict the result. The fusion of neural network and fuzzy logic will give the perfect blend in decision making and the least manual intervention, automatizing the complete process. NFL facilitates data training and the generation of membership functions and rules without manual intervention. The experimental data are loaded into the neuro-fuzzy designer by specifying NFL performance parameters such as input and output membership function type, neural network optimization algorithm, tolerance error, and the number of epochs before training model type. The stator winding faults were introduced in the model and have been predicted correctly with 93.3% for neuro-fuzzy logic is shown in Fig. 5.

Artificial neural network
An artificial neural network (ANN) is a supervised learning method. The primary objective is to minimize the error in the output layer by searching for a set of connection strengths that cause the ANN to produce outputs equal to or closer to the targets [46]. The acquired experimental stator current data are split into training and testing. The test data ensure that the model should not go biased against training data. Next, initialize the weights for each layer at random, and carry out forward propagation for all input data. The output layer error was calculated using SGD, RMSprop, Adagrad, Adam, and Adamax. A back-propagation technique was implemented to update the weights to reach the targets closer [47]. In general, the number of hidden layers in the network depends on how complex the problem is. The larger the network’s trainable parameters, the higher the degree of polynomials needed to fit the data. Various activation functions are used in artificial neural network models, such as sigmoid function, tanh function, relu function, leaky relu function, and softmax function to impart nonlinearity. Nonlinearity enables efficient back-propagation of errors in updating weight concerning output errors to create network learning effectively. The proposed work has developed FSA-I NN, and FSA-II NN architecture for early identification of stator winding faults in the industrial machine is shown in Fig. 6.

Descriptions of the architecture, layer-wise parameters, and FSA model output shape are shown in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. The proposed FSA model architecture makes a novel contribution in terms of network size, hyper tuning parameters, and fault identification accuracy. Keras Tuner is a distributed platform for hyperparameter optimization. Keras Tuner makes it easy to define a search space and leverage included algorithms to find the best hyperparameter value.

Experimental investigation
The experimental setup has been laid out for both healthy and faulty squirrel cage induction motors (SCIMs). Current signatures have been acquired at a 10 kHz sampling rate using virtual and modular instruments. It consists of a hall-effect current transducer (LA-25P), USB-6210 bus-powered M series data acquisition module, and the LabView environment is shown in Fig. 7. The data acquisition module is eight differential or 16 single-ended (16-Bit, 250 kS/s), four digital input, four digital output USB multi-function I/O devices. The rated parameters for an induction motor are listed in Table 4.

Dataset
The experimental data were acquired from both healthy and faulty three-phase squirrel cage induction motors under various stator winding failure synopses, such as initial stage failure, development stage failure, and faulty stage under different loading conditions. The number of data points for all states is listed in Table 5. Consequently, it obtained 36 million data points at a sampling rate of 10 kHz. The FSA has considered all the three-phase currents for training the classifier models. The number of data points acquired from the experimental setup shows that all three-phase currents 𝐼𝑎 𝐼𝑏 and 𝐼𝑐 have been considered for identification of fault as manifested in the tabular columns. FSA could take only no-load condition for one faulty case as the fault current has exceeded the motor’s rated current, although a rheostat was used to restrict the fault current.

Data preprocessing
The proposed algorithm ensures a decent ordering of the data. The algorithm also ensures that it gathers enough data to train and test the models for the classification. It aims to obtain an accurate, fast, and adaptable model, characterized at the same time by low computational complexity.

Wavelets
Wavelet transform uses a window that can be used to translate or scale the requisite signal. Wavelet uses space-based functions, both real and Fourier. Wavelets can approximate high frequencies with smaller time-domain windows and allow a proportionally larger window for lower frequencies. Wavelet can have excellent time resolution for high-frequency signals and adequate frequency resolution for low-frequency signals; the fusion of both constraints is ideal for real-time applications. Continuous wavelet transformation, or CWT, is used to analyze time-frequencies, and discrete wavelet transformation, or DWT, is used to denoise a signal. The proposed work uses discrete wavelet transformation over continuous wavelet transformation. The number of coefficients obtained after the transformation is the same as the input sample, and no data are lost. CWT contains many coefficients, but most are redundant, resulting in computationally inefficient work with continuous wavelet transformation coefficients. Haar wavelet, Daubechies wavelet, Symlets, Coiflets, biorthogonal wavelet, reverse biorthogonal wavelet, and discrete Meyer wavelet are the various types of wavelets available for discrete wavelet transformation. The proposed AI-based fault signature analyzer for real-time condition monitoring for industrial machines uses several wavelet decomposition levels to identify internal failures at their incipient stages.

Pattern recognition
Any pattern recognition problem essentially comprises feature extraction, feature selection, and classification to recognize the signature of fault from both healthy and faulty motors. The next step, DWT, is to obtain wavelet coefficients and take statistical features to train classifier models from the obtained coefficients. The wavelet-based function extraction significantly reduces the computational complexity compared to training the classifier models with the raw stator current data. To reduce the number of input variables is prudent to both lessen the modeling computational costs and, in some cases, improve the model’s performance. Hence, the selection of statistical features from the wavelet’s coefficients uses a decision tree algorithm. The decision tree is a tree-based learning methodology used to represent classification rules. A conventional decision tree induced with the C4.5 algorithm consists of one root, several branches, nodes, and many leaves. Each node includes one attribute, and one branch is a chain of nodes from the root to a leaf. A feature in the tree provides learning about the significance of the associated attribute [48]. J48 algorithm (WEKA implementation of C4.5) is a generally used one to build the decision tree. The machine learning model then used the best prominent selected features from the decision tree. The proposed work uses different machine learning models, such as neuro-fuzzy logic, random forest, K-nearest neighbor, fuzzy logic, artificial neural network, to classify stator winding faults in industrial machines. These machine learning models are compared in detail with statistical features and without them. Finally, an efficient model was selected using an AI-based FSA to give the extensive fault signature under various operating conditions such as loading and fault stipulations.

Numerical modeling
In one of the phases of stator winding for a motor, the stator turn–turn fault was identified, and the frequency domain analysis was thoroughly examined. The stator turn–turn fault was introduced into the motor by tapping the stator windings at 25%, 50%, and 75%, corresponding to initial and development stage failures, respectively. The induction motor was numerically modeled with and without a stator turn–turn problem. The numerical model parameters are summarized in Table 6. The configuration of the winding stator with a turn–turn fault is shown in Fig. 8. A dynamic numerical model of a three-phase squirrel cage induction motor (SCIM) in a healthy operating condition was implemented in Eqs. 1–6. A dynamic numerical model was analyzed and depicted in the abc and 𝛼𝛽0 coordinates of a three-phase squirrel cage induction motor with a stator turn–turn fault. The zero sequence component has zero stator current for the star-connected winding configuration. The choice between stationary, rotating, and synchronous frames depends on the machine fault in its working condition. The induction motor’s numerical model was developed in the 𝛼𝛽0 stationary reference frame (stator voltage is either unbalanced or discontinuous).

(11)
A winding could replace the Nr rotor bars with Nr phases for the motor. The complete distribution of magnetomotive rotor force can be accomplished concerning space harmonics given by 𝐹𝑟(𝑡,𝑥) [49],

𝐹𝑟(𝑡,𝑥)=∑𝜈=1∞𝑁𝑟𝐼𝑟𝜈max𝜋∑𝛾=1∞1𝛾sin(𝛾𝜏𝑐𝑟2)×sin(𝛾𝑁𝑟𝑥±𝑠𝜈𝜔𝑡)
(12)
where 𝐼𝑟𝜈max is the maximum value of the 𝜈th harmonic rotor current, and 𝜏𝑐𝑟 is the rotor equivalent coil pitch. The flux produced by the 𝛾th harmonics in the bth stator coil is determined as follows:

𝛷𝑟𝑠,𝑏,𝛾(𝑡)=𝛷max𝑏,𝛾sin{𝛾𝑁𝑟𝜔𝑟𝑝𝑡±𝜈𝜔𝑡+𝛾2𝜋(𝑏−1)3}
(13)
where 𝜔𝑟 is the rotor speed in electrical radians/s. Subsequently, the frequencies caused in the stator coils by the MMF rotor’s space harmonics can be expressed as;

𝑓stator=[𝛾𝑁𝑟𝑝(1−𝑠)±𝜈]𝑓supply
(14)
where 𝛾 is 0, 1, 2, 3,  and so on. The experimental setup has limitations over-analyzing multiple failures at a minute change in the inter-turn short-circuited turns. Therefore, the numerical model has at first validated results from the experimental setup for possible failure conditions. Thus, any number of inter-turn short information can be obtained from the numerical model. Predicting time to failure will require a lot of data by running the motor to analyze the propagation of failure from one point to another.

Results and discussions
All models have some predictive error, given the data sample’s statistical noise, the incompleteness of the data sample, and the shortcomings of each variant model type. Therefore, the assumption of a perfect or best model is not applicable. Instead, we must explore a model that is good enough. A model meets the requirements and constraints, sufficiently competent given the time and resources available, skilled compared to other models evaluated, and capable of state-of-the-art models. In this work, various machine learning models were implemented, and different performance attributes for each algorithm were analyzed with and without statistical features. The performance of each algorithm was tested in real-time by collecting stator current signals from both healthy and faulty induction motors under different operating conditions. The stator current was collected at a 10 kHz sampling rate to avoid loss of information, i.e., present in stator current signature. Previous works reported that the artificial neural network model could classify healthy and faulty motors with greater accuracy. An extensive network with more complexity can lead to overfitting, and a small network with insufficient parameters can lead to underfitting. Therefore, the following two model designs are used after examining out multiple models with various degrees of depth. It has been found that ANN performed better when compared to any other machine learning algorithms. Hence, two ANN models, FSA-I NN and FSA-II with and without statistical featured current data, classify different industries’ faults. Also, various performance attributes were analyzed in detecting fault signatures, such as accuracy, loss, time/epoch.

The proposed work has concluded that the wavelet transform is a reliable solution to identify stator winding faults, and if so, what are the parameters on which it depends? The window size determines how many samples to take at a time to evaluate the wavelet transition. Wavelet level; the wavelet used for the change was made to vary—e.g., db1, db2, db3, and so forth, and hold where relevant reliability information is accessible. To reduce the number of input variables is prudent to both lessen the modeling computational costs and, in some cases, improve the model’s performance. Hence, the selection of statistical features from the wavelet’s coefficients using a decision tree algorithm. Thus, the decision tree algorithm evaluated the performance of the model on each feature. The machine learning model then used the best prominent selected features from the decision tree. The topmost node of the decision tree is the most notable feature for fault identification. Fig. 9, it can be concluded that features such as maximum, minimum, and range provide accuracy of up to 91%, while median, kurtosis, and the average rate of change are minimal precision. However, the combination of these functions provided an identification accuracy of up to 99%, as listed in Table 7. It can be observed that the proposed FSA-II NN has exhibited better accuracy in identification than the FSA-I NN classifier model.

The proposed FSA-II NN classifier model was trained against 36M datasets for different epoch sizes, such as 100, 150, 200, and 250. FSA-II NN was found to have greater accuracy at 200 epoch runs with learning rates of 0.002, decay 1e-6, Ada optimizer. Hence, the FSA-II NN analyzed for different wavelets is shown in Fig. 10.

The accuracy saturation with respect to the wavelet levels

Full size image
The validation error graph is generally U-shaped in machine learning, whereas the training error graph saturates to a minimum in terms of epochs [? ?]. When the minimal validation error is reached, the number of epochs or iterations must be terminated. The training error of different wavelets is represented in Fig. 10 using a more significant number of epochs. When the findings of Fig. 10 and Table 7 are combined, it is clear that all wavelets will eventually provide the best classification accuracy. Certain wavelet families, on the other hand, can achieve maximal accuracy with fewer training epochs.

A comparison of the classifier model results is made and tabulated with and without statistical features of the experimental stator current data from both healthy and faulty induction motors in Table 8. Table 9 displays several wavelets, such as Daubechies (DB), Symlet (sym), Coiflets (coif), biorthogonal (bior), Fejér-Korovkin (fk), reverse biorthogonal (rbio) at different levels of decomposition for stator fault identification. It can be established that the lower the DWT level, the better features are obtained that represents the degree of a fault condition and lead to better accuracy irrespective of the type of the wavelets. The decomposition of the discrete wavelet with different wavelet levels may explain how each wavelet that follows is identical to the previous wavelet. The lower the wavelet level, the greater the accuracy—e.g., fk4 gives better accuracy than fk6, which gives better accuracy than fk8. FSA-I NN and FSA-II NN with and without statistical features can be depicted from Fig. 11.

The wavelets sym1, db1, and bior1.1 with a window size of 10000 have better accuracy in identifying fault signatures. These are best-suited wavelets accompanied by Rbio, Coif, and FK for identifying stator fault. The multiple mother wavelets are assessed on the experimental stator current signal. The best for fault detection in an induction motor is bior1.1 at level 2 DWT with a window size of 10000. After a certain number of epochs, the accuracy for all wavelets, i.e., 200 epochs, was saturated irrespective of the wavelet chosen. From the above results, it can be concluded that specific wavelets can give better accuracy with fewer epochs. Still, after some degree, they all provide the saturated accuracy as shown in Fig. 12. The proposed method is also evaluated under working conditions such as the gradual variation of the load, and satisfactory results are shown in Fig. 13. The sideband components at frequencies 685–790 Hz under fault stipulations have relatively equal values as evaluated from the numerical model, supporting the theoretical and numerical analysis. The experimental induction motor’s current signatures at different operating conditions are shown in Fig. 14. The performance comparison of the machine learning classifier models from the literature review is also performed and tabulated in Table 10. Artificial neural network model fed with statistical featured stator current data has been found to have outperformed raw data. FSA-II NN has provided a much higher classification accuracy of 98% with a minimal acceptable training and validation loss.

The proposed research aims to determine the optimal mother wavelet using statistical characteristics extracted from experimental setup data. The proposed work has done extensive literature on various wavelets with their families with and without statistical features. The authors were unable to locate any relevant works in the literature. However, there have been a few recent papers that use wavelet technology. Still, they are limited in assessing different wavelets and ultimately determining the accuracy rate for stator turn–turn fault diagnosis. The performance comparison of the proposed study with available research on wavelet technology has been incorporated in the revised article. Using various wavelets and their families, the proposed work evaluated the performance of the proposed FSA-I NN and FSA-II NN architectures with and without statistical features. As demonstrated in Table11, Bior1.1 at level 2 DWT with a window size of 10,000 achieved detection accuracy of 98.43% from the proposed architectures.

Conclusions
A comparison of different machine learning algorithms such as neural network, random forest, fuzzy logic, neuro-fuzzy logic, K-nearest neighbors is performed with and without statistical features, and various performance attributes are quantified. Besides that, the accuracy of the techniques used in today’s literature was compared to the authors’ solution to evaluate the proposed method’s results with other state-of-the-art solutions. The experimental setup observed that the stator current exceeded the rated value while the motor was operated under the half-loading condition for a 50% stator turn–turn winding short. Therefore, an external rheostat was connected across short-circuit winding to restrain it to the rated current and examine the motor under different fault stipulations. Although external rheostat was bound to control the short-circuit current in the circuit, the development, and faulty stage data were not acquired at some loading conditions as they exceeded the motor’s rated current. However, the proposed work has considered half-load operating conditions for healthy and fault stipulations, thereby meeting the industry’s requirements. It can also be suggested that identifying stator failure using a wavelet-based extraction method is accurate since it could identify healthy and faulty industrial induction motors with 98% accuracy. Therefore, a reliable, automatic fault signature from a motor current is analyzed using a fusion of wavelet-based feature extraction techniques along with a knowledge-based FSA-II NN.
