An adaptive leader-following consensus tracking control approach is considered for strict-feedback nonlinear multi-agent systems, which contain unknown parameters and dynamic leader with both input and output. An adaptive tracking controller and adaptive consensus controllers are designed for nonlinear leader agent and follower agents by backstepping control technique, respectively. Compared to the control methods in the existing literature, only a few adaptive laws need to be constructed by tuning function approach, and the number of design parameters is greatly reduced also. Furthermore, through the Lyapunov stability principle, the tracking error and consensus errors asymptotically converge to zero, and other signals in nonlinear multi-agent systems are bounded. A simulation example shows the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control method at the end of this paper.

Introduction
Over the last few decades, the cooperative control problem of multi-agent systems (MASs) has attracted wide attention from scholars because of its wide applications, for instance, sensor networks, unmanned aerial vehicle formation, disaster emergency response and so on (see [1,2,3,4]). For MASs, the leader only depends on its own states, but affects the behavior of all followers. Because of different control targets of MASs, it can be divided into containment control [5,6,7,8,9], synchronous control [10], consensus control [11,12,13,14,15], flocking control [16] and formation control [17, 18] and so on. In the cooperative control of MASs, the consensus control as the basis of cooperative control between agents has important practical significance and theoretical value. Consensus control means that a certain state of all agents tends to be consistent after a period of time. Based on neural network and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, an adaptive consensus control method was proposed to solve the consensus control problem of nonlinear MASs with state delays in [11]. For nonlinear stochastic MASs with high-order strict-feedback form, a leader-following consensus control method was investigated in [12]. Based on weighted edge dynamics, a fault-tolerant consensus control approach was studied for uncertain MASs with completely unknown system model in [15]. Although the above control method can solve the problem of cooperative control of multi-agent systems, they are not effective for the systems with unknown parameters.

It is well known that imperfections are unavoidable in production processes of real devices, for example, the control method of an imperfect electromechanical round system was investigated in [19]. Compared to linear systems, most practical industrial problems can be modeled as nonlinear systems, so it is more practical to study the cooperative control of nonlinear MASs with unknown parameters. Due to the complex structure of nonlinear MASs, model errors or system uncertainties often need to be transmitted to each other. This is likely to cause control performance degradation and even system instability. So far, the controller design of nonlinear systems with uncertain unknown parameters is still a difficult point and challenge in the control field. Adaptive control technique has become an effective approach to solve the above problems. Literature [20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29] proposed some adaptive control methods for nonlinear MASs. In [26], an adaptive consensus tracking iterative learning control approach was investigated for the nonlinear MASs by using distributed disturbance compensation. Based on nonidentical control directions and unknown identical, two effective adaptive fuzzy leader-following consensus control approaches were studied for nonlinear first-order MASs in [27]. To avoid congestion, a sufficient condition of lag group adaptive consensus was considered for second-order nonlinear MASs, which can be divided into multiple subgroups in [29]. It can be clearly seen that all system models were first- or second-order MASs in [27,28,29]. According to the laws of physics, such as Newton’s laws of motion, Euler’s equations, Lagrange’s equations, Gilkhoff’s law, etc., many models of real industrial systems are higher-order differential equations. For example, the jerk system [29] was modeled as a third-order nonlinear dynamic, and a single-link flexible manipulator [30] was described by a fourth-order differential equation. For the leaders of existing MASs control, either the trajectories of leaders were given directly [6, 7], or the dynamic differential equations of leaders with no control inputs were provided [8, 9], and [11]. But for many practical problems, the leader is composed of dynamic equations with input and output, therefore it is of practical value and theoretical significance to research the adaptive consensus control for nonlinear high-order MASs with unknown parameters and dynamic leader.

So far, there is no result regarding adaptive tracking consensus control of strict-feedback high-order nonlinear MASs, which contains unknown parameters and dynamic leader with both input and output. In this paper, the proposed adaptive backstepping consensus tracking control method will be divided into two parts. First, for the leader, an adaptive tracking controller is constructed so that the output of leader can track a given reference trajectory. Second, for the followers, adaptive consensus controllers are designed; hence the outputs of the followers can achieve consensus performance with the leader. The main contributions are summarized as follows:

1.
Compared with the existing literatures [31,32,33,34,35,36], the number of adaptive laws is greatly reduced by introducing tuning function for the controller design in this paper, and the number of adjustment parameters is also very small.

2.
For the existing literature on MASs control, the leader’s trajectories are given directly [6, 7], or the leader’s dynamic differential equations with no control inputs are provided [8, 9], and [11]. Therefore, it is not required for the leaders to design controllers to achieve their own tracking performance. In this paper, it is assumed that the leader’s dynamic equations are described by strict-feedback nonlinear systems with both input and output, which contain unknown parameters. To the authors’ knowledge, it is more practical.

Problem formulation and preliminaries
Problem formulation
The MASs are made of with N followers and one leader. The dynamic equations of the 𝜏th agent are given as:

⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪𝑥˙𝜏,𝜉=𝑓𝜏,𝜉(𝑥−𝜏,𝜉)+𝜃𝑇𝜏𝜑𝜏,𝜉(𝑥−𝜏,𝜉)+𝑥𝜏,𝜉+1,1≤𝜉≤𝑛−1,𝑥˙𝜏,𝑛=𝑓𝜏,𝑛(𝑥−𝜏,𝑛)+𝜃𝑇𝜏𝜑𝜏,𝑛(𝑥−𝜏,𝑛)+𝑢𝜏,𝑦𝜏=𝑥𝜏,1.
(1)
where 𝑥⎯⎯𝜏,𝜉=[𝑥𝜏,1,𝑥𝜏,2,…,𝑥𝜏,𝜉]𝑇∈𝑅𝜉 and 𝑥⎯⎯𝜏,𝑛=[𝑥𝜏,1, 𝑥𝜏,2,…,𝑥𝜏,𝑛]𝑇∈𝑅𝑛 are the state vectors. 𝑦𝜏 and 𝑢𝜏 are the output and input of the 𝜏th (𝜏=0,1,2,…,𝑁) agent, respectively. 𝑓𝜏,𝜉(𝑥⎯⎯𝜏,𝜉)∈𝑅 stands for the smooth function. 𝜑𝜏,𝜉(𝑥⎯⎯𝜏,𝜉)∈𝑅𝑛 is the smooth vector function. 𝜃𝜏∈𝑅𝑛 denotes the unknown parameter vector. The agent is leader when 𝜏=0, otherwise the agent is follower.

Assumption 1 [33,34,35]: Both the leader’s reference signal 𝑦𝑟 and its derivative 𝑦𝑟, 𝑦˙𝑟,..., 𝑦(𝑛)𝑟 are continuous and bounded.

To model the information exchange between agents, the graph theory is introduced. The exchange of information between the followers is described by 𝛩=(𝜛,𝛾,𝛯), in which 𝜛={𝑙1,…𝑙𝑁} is the set of agents, the edge set is denoted as 𝛾={(𝑙𝜏,𝑙𝑗)}∈𝜛×𝜛, and 𝛯=[𝑎𝜏𝑗]∈𝑅𝑁×𝑁 is defined as the adjacency matrix. (𝑙𝜏,𝑙𝑗)∈𝜚 means that follower j is able to gain the information of its neighbor agent 𝜏. If (𝑙𝜏,𝑙𝑗)∉𝜚, 𝑎𝜏𝑗=0; if not 𝑎𝜏𝑗=1. 𝛬=[𝛬𝜏𝑗]∈𝑅𝑁×𝑁=𝐺−𝛯 described the Laplacian matrix, and 𝛬𝜏𝑗=−𝑎𝜏𝑗 if 𝜏≠𝑗. 𝐺=𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔(𝑑1,…,𝑑𝑁) denotes the degree matrix of agent 𝜏. Every follower agent owns at least a neighbor, meanwhile, the leader does not own neighbors.

Let 𝐵:=𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔{𝑏1,𝑏2,...,𝑏𝑁} denote the communication weight matrix between agents and leader. 𝑜𝜏=∑𝑁𝑗=1,𝑗≠𝜏𝑎𝜏𝑗+𝑏𝜏. If there exists the information exchange between agents 𝜏 and leader, then 𝑏𝜏=1. Otherwise, 𝑏𝜏=0. It is stipulated that at least one follower connects with leader, i.e., 𝑏1+𝑏2+⋯+𝑏𝑁>0.

Adaptive tracking controller design for leader
An adaptive tracking controller will be constructed first though backstepping control technique for the dynamic model of leader with both input and output. The controller design will be divided into n steps. In the first (𝑛−1)th steps, the virtual controllers will be designed. Then, the actual controller will be designed at the nth step.

The following coordinate transformation of the dynamic leader is expressed as

𝑠0,1=𝑠0,𝜉=𝑦0−𝑦𝑟,𝑥0,𝜉−𝛼0,𝜉,𝜉=2,...,𝑛
(2)
Step 1: From Eqs. (1) and (2), 𝑠˙0,1 is obtained as

𝑠˙0,1=𝑓0,1+𝜃𝑇0𝜑0,1+𝑥0,2−𝑦˙𝑟
(3)
Consider the Lyapunov function candidate as

𝑉0,1=12𝑠20,1+12𝑟0𝜃̃ 𝑇0𝜃̃ 0
(4)
where 𝑟0 is a positive design parameter, 𝜃̃ 0=𝜃0−𝜃̂ 0, and 𝜃̂ 0 is the estimate of 𝜃0.

The derivative of 𝑉0,1 is given by

𝑉˙0,1==𝑠0,1(𝑓0,1+𝜃𝑇0𝜑0,1+𝑥0,2−𝑦˙𝑟)−1𝑟0𝜃̃ 𝑇0𝜃̂ ˙0𝑠0,1(𝑓0,1+𝜃𝑇0𝜑0,1+𝑠0,2+𝛼0,2−𝑦˙𝑟)−1𝑟0𝜃̃ 𝑇0𝜃̂ ˙0
(5)
The first virtual controller 𝛼0,2 is chosen as

𝛼0,2=−𝑘0,1𝑠0,1−𝑓0,1−𝜃̂ 𝑇0𝜑0,1+𝑦˙𝑟
(6)
where 𝑘0,1 is a positive design parameter.

A tuning function 𝛥0,1 is chosen as

𝛥0,1=𝑠0,1𝜑0,1
(7)
then, one has

𝑉˙0,1≤−𝑘0,1𝑠20,1+𝑠0,1𝑠0,2+𝜃̃ 𝑇0(𝛥0,1−1𝑟0𝜃̂ ˙0)
(8)
Step 𝜉: It follows from Eqs. (1) and (2) that 𝑠˙0,𝜉 can be determined by

𝑠˙0,𝜉=𝑓0,𝜉+𝜃𝑇0𝜑0,𝜉+𝑥0,𝜉+1−𝛼˙0,𝜉
(9)
Based on the last backstepping step, 𝛼˙0,𝜉 can be given as follows

𝛼˙0,𝜉=∑𝜎=1𝜉−1∂𝛼0,𝜉∂𝑥0,𝜎𝑥˙0,𝜎+∂𝛼0,𝜉∂𝜃̂ 0𝜃̂ ˙0+∑𝜎=0𝜉−1∂𝛼0,𝜉∂𝑦(𝜎)𝑦(𝜎+1)
(10)
Define the Lyapunov function candidate as

𝑉0,𝜉=𝑉0,𝜉−1+12𝑠20,𝜉
(11)
With (9) and (10), the derivative of 𝑉0,𝜉 can be given by

𝑉˙0,𝜉=≤𝑉˙0,𝜉−1+𝑠0,𝜉𝑠˙0,𝜉−∑𝜎=1𝜉−1𝑘0,𝜎𝑠20,𝜎+𝑠0,𝜉−1𝑠0,𝜉+𝜃̃ 𝑇0(𝛥0,𝜉−1−1𝑟0𝜃̂ ˙0)+∑𝜎=2𝜉−1𝑟0𝑠0,𝜎∂𝛼0,𝜎∂𝜃̂ 0(𝛥0,𝜉−1−1𝑟0𝜃̂ ˙0)+𝑠0,𝜉(𝑓0,𝜉+𝜃𝑇0𝜑0,𝜉+𝑠0,𝜉+1+𝛼0,𝜉+1−∑𝜎=1𝜉−1∂𝛼0,𝜉∂𝑥0,𝜎𝑥˙0,𝜎−∂𝛼0,𝜉∂𝜃̂ 0𝜃̂ ˙0−∑𝜎=0𝜉−1∂𝛼0,𝜉∂𝑦(𝜎)𝑦(𝜎+1))
(12)
Now lets define the following virtual control

𝛼0,𝜉+1=−𝑘0,𝜉𝑠0,𝜉−𝑠0,𝜉−1−𝑓0,𝜉−𝜃̂ 𝑇0𝜑0,𝜉+∑𝜎=1𝜉−1∂𝛼0,𝜉∂𝑥0,𝜎(𝑓0,𝜎+𝑥0,𝜎+1)+∑𝜎=1𝜉−1∂𝛼0,𝜉∂𝑥0,𝜎𝜃̂ 𝑇0𝜑0,𝜎+𝑟0∂𝛼0,𝜉∂𝜃̂ 0𝛥0,𝜉−1+∑𝜎=0𝜉−1∂𝛼0,𝜉∂𝑦(𝜎)𝑦(𝜎+1)+∑𝜎=2𝜉𝑟0𝑠0,𝜎∂𝛼0,𝜎∂𝜃̂ 0(𝜑0,𝜉−∑𝜎=1𝜉−1∂𝛼0,𝜉∂𝑥0,𝜎𝜑0,𝜎)
(13)
and introduce the variable

𝛥0,𝜉=𝛥0,𝜉−1+𝑠0,𝜉𝜑0,𝜉−𝑠0,𝜉∑𝜎=1𝜉−1∂𝛼0,𝜉∂𝑥0,𝜎𝜑0,𝜎
(14)
where 𝑘0,𝜉 is a positive design parameter.

Then, it can be proved that 𝑉˙0,𝜉 is expressed as

𝑉˙0,𝜉≤−∑𝜎=1𝜉𝑘0,𝜎𝑠20,𝜎+𝑠0,𝜉𝑠0,𝜉+1+𝜃̃ 𝑇0(𝛥0,𝜉−1𝑟0𝜃̂ ˙0)+∑𝜎=2𝜉𝑟0𝑠0,𝜎∂𝛼0,𝜎∂𝜃̂ 0(𝛥0,𝜉−1𝑟0𝜃̂ ˙0)
(15)
Step n: The derivative of 𝑠0,𝑛 can be expressed by

𝑠˙0,𝑛=𝑓0,𝑛+𝜃𝑇0𝜑0,𝑛+𝑢0−𝛼˙0,𝑛
(16)
where

𝛼˙0,𝑛=∑𝜎=1𝑛−1∂𝛼0,𝑛∂𝑥0,𝜎𝑥˙0,𝜎+∂𝛼0,𝑛∂𝜃̂ 0𝜃̂ ˙0+∑𝜎=0𝑛−1∂𝛼0,𝑛∂𝑦(𝜎)𝑦(𝜎+1)
(17)
Consider the Lyapunov function candidate as

𝑉0,𝑛=𝑉0,𝑛−1+12𝑠20,𝑛
(18)
Then, by using (16) and (17), the derivative of 𝑉0,𝑛 can be written as

𝑉˙0,𝑛=≤𝑉˙0,𝑛−1+𝑠0,𝑛𝑠˙0,𝑛−∑𝜎=1𝑛−1𝑘0,𝜎𝑠20,𝜎+𝑠0,𝑛−1𝑠0,𝑛+𝜃̃ 𝑇0(𝛥0,𝑛−1−1𝑟0𝜃̂ ˙0)+∑𝜎=2𝑛−1𝑟0𝑠0,𝜎∂𝛼0,𝜎∂𝜃̂ 0(𝛥0,𝑛−1−1𝑟0𝜃̂ ˙0)+𝑠0,𝑛(𝑓0,𝑛+𝜃𝑇0𝜑0,𝑛+𝑢0−∑𝜎=1𝑛−1∂𝛼0,𝑛∂𝑥0,𝜎𝑥˙0,𝜎−∂𝛼0,𝑛∂𝜃̂ 0𝜃̂ ˙0−∑𝜎=0𝑛−1∂𝛼0,𝑛∂𝑦(𝜎)𝑦(𝜎+1))
(19)
The actual controller and tuning function of the leader are designed as

𝑢0=−𝑘0,𝑛𝑠0,𝑛−𝑠0,𝑛−1−𝑓0,𝑛−𝜃̂ 𝑇0𝜑0,𝑛+∑𝜎=1𝑛−1∂𝛼0,𝑛∂𝑥0,𝜎(𝑓0,𝜎+𝑥0,𝜎+1)+∑𝜎=1𝑛−1∂𝛼0,𝑛∂𝑥0,𝜎𝜃̂ 𝑇0𝜑0,𝜎+𝑟0∂𝛼0,𝑛∂𝜃̂ 0𝛥0,𝑛−1+∑𝜎=0𝑛−1∂𝛼0,𝑛∂𝑦(𝜎)𝑦(𝜎+1)+∑𝜎=2𝑛𝑟0𝑠0,𝜎∂𝛼0,𝜎∂𝜃̂ 0(𝜑0,𝑛−∑𝜎=1𝑛−1∂𝛼0,𝑛∂𝑥0,𝜎𝜑0,𝜎)
(20)
and

𝛥0,𝑛=𝛥0,𝑛−1+𝑠0,𝑛𝜑0,𝑛−𝑠0,𝑛∑𝜎=1𝑛−1∂𝛼0,𝑛∂𝑥0,𝜎𝜑0,𝜎
(21)
where 𝑘0,𝑛 is a positive design parameter.

Then, one has

𝑉˙0,𝑛≤−∑𝜎=1𝑛𝑘0,𝜎𝑠20,𝜎+𝜃̃ 𝑇0(𝛥0,𝑛−1𝑟0𝜃̂ ˙0)+∑𝜎=2𝑛𝑟0𝑠0,𝜎∂𝛼0,𝜎∂𝜃̂ 0(𝛥0,𝑛−1𝑟0𝜃̂ ˙0)
(22)
Choose the adaptive law in the following

𝜃̂ ˙0=𝑟0𝛥0,𝑛
(23)
Then, it is easy to obtain that

𝑉˙0,𝑛≤−∑𝜎=1𝑛𝑘0,𝜎𝑠20,𝜎
(24)
Remark 1
For the cooperative control of nonlinear MASs in [13, 17, 27], all of the leaders equations do not have uncertainties and control input. However, in this paper, the adaptive consensus controllers for nonlinear MASs with behaviors of both leader and followers are governed by nonlinear strict-feedback control systems with unknown parameters. The consensus control problem with a dynamic leader is more practical and more challenging in controller design than that with a fixed leader.

Adaptive consensus controllers for followers
Similar to the adaptive backstepping control of the leader, the number of steps for an adaptive backstepping controller design is the same as the order of each follower. For the 𝜏th follower, the coordinate transformation is designed as

𝑠𝜏,1=𝑠𝜏,𝜉=∑𝑗=1,𝑗≠𝜏𝑁𝑎𝜏𝑗(𝑦𝜏−𝑦𝑗)+𝑏𝜏(𝑦𝜏−𝑦0),𝑥𝜏,𝜉−𝛼𝜏,𝜉,𝜉=2,...,𝑛
(25)
Step 1: It follows from (1) and (25) that 𝑠˙𝜏,1 can be determined by

𝑠˙𝜏,1==∑𝑗=1,𝑗≠𝜏𝑁𝑎𝜏𝑗𝑦˙𝜏+𝑏𝜏𝑦˙𝜏−∑𝑗=1,𝑗≠𝜏𝑁𝑎𝜏𝑗𝑦˙𝑗−𝑏𝜏𝑦˙0𝑜𝜏(𝑓𝜏,1+𝜃𝑇𝜏𝜑𝜏,1+𝑠𝜏,2+𝛼𝜏,2)−∑𝑗=1,𝑗≠𝜏𝑁𝑎𝜏𝑗(𝑓𝑗,1+𝜃𝑇𝑗𝜑𝑗,1+𝑥𝑗,2)−𝑏𝜏(𝑓0,1+𝜃𝑇0𝜑0,1+𝑥0,2)
(26)
Select the Lyapunov function candidate

𝑉𝜏,1=12𝑠2𝜏,1+12∑𝑗=1,𝑗≠𝜏𝑁𝑎𝜏𝑗1𝑟𝜏𝑗𝜃̃ 𝑇𝜏𝑗𝜃̃ 𝜏𝑗+12𝑟𝜏𝜃̃ 𝑇𝜏𝜃̃ 𝜏+𝑏𝜏2𝛽𝜏0𝜃̃ 𝑇𝜏0𝜃̃ 𝜏0
(27)
where 𝑟𝜏𝑗, 𝑟𝜏 and 𝛽𝜏0 represent positive design parameters, 𝜃̃ 𝜏𝑗=𝜃𝑗−𝜃̂ 𝜏𝑗, 𝜃̃ 𝜏=𝜃𝜏−𝜃̂ 𝜏 and 𝜃̃ 𝜏0=𝜃0−𝜃̂ 𝜏0, 𝜃̂ 𝜏𝑗, 𝜃̂ 𝜏 and 𝜃̂ 𝜏0 are the estimations of 𝜃𝑗, 𝜃𝜏 and 𝜃0, respectively.

By (26), one has

𝑉˙𝜏,1=𝑠𝜏,1(𝑜𝜏(𝑓𝜏,1+𝜃𝑇𝜏𝜑𝜏,1+𝑠𝜏,2+𝛼𝜏,2)−∑𝑗=1,𝑗≠𝜏𝑁𝑎𝜏𝑗(𝑓𝑗,1+𝜃𝑇𝑗𝜑𝑗,1+𝑥𝑗,2)−𝑏𝜏(𝑓0,1+𝜃𝑇0𝜑0,1+𝑥0,2))−1𝑟𝜏𝜃̃ 𝑇𝜏𝜃̂ ˙𝜏−∑𝑗=1,𝑗≠𝜏𝑁𝑎𝜏𝑗1𝑟𝜏𝑗𝜃̃ 𝑇𝜏𝑗𝜃̂ ˙𝜏𝑗−𝑏𝜏𝛽𝜏0𝜃̃ 𝑇𝜏0𝜃̂ ˙𝜏0
(28)
The first virtual controller 𝛼𝜏,2 is chosen as

𝛼𝜏,2=1𝑜𝜏(−𝑘𝜏,1𝑠𝜏,1−𝑜𝜏𝑓𝜏,1−𝑜𝜏𝜃̂ 𝑇𝜏𝜑𝜏,1+∑𝑗=1,𝑗≠𝜏𝑁𝑎𝜏𝑗(𝑓𝑗,1+𝑥𝑗,2)+∑𝑗=1,𝑗≠𝜏𝑁𝑎𝜏𝑗𝜃̂ 𝑇𝜏𝑗𝜑𝑗,1+𝑏𝜏(𝑓0,1+𝑥0,2)+𝑏𝜏𝜃̂ 𝑇𝜏0𝜑0,1)
(29)
where 𝑘𝜏,1 is a positive design parameter.

Substituting the virtual controller (29) into (28) yields

𝑉˙𝜏,1≤−𝑘𝜏,1𝑠2𝜏,1+𝑜𝜏𝑠𝜏,1𝑠𝜏,2+𝜃̃ 𝑇𝜏(𝑜𝜏𝑠𝜏,1𝜑𝜏,1−1𝑟𝜏𝜃̂ ˙𝜏)−∑𝑗=1,𝑗≠𝜏𝑁𝑎𝜏𝑗𝜃̃ 𝑇𝜏𝑗(𝑠𝜏,1𝜑𝑗,1+1𝑟𝜏𝑗𝜃̂ ˙𝜏𝑗)−𝑏𝜏𝜃̃ 𝑇𝜏0(𝑠𝜏,1𝜑0,1+1𝛽𝜏0𝜃̂ ˙𝜏0)

(32)
𝛤𝑗,1=𝑠𝜏,1𝜑𝑗,1
(33)

(39)
where 𝑘𝜏,2 is a positive design parameter.

Substituting (39) into (38), one has

Remark 2
For the traditional backstepping control method, the adaptive law must be designed at each step, such as [13, 31] and [33]. But in this paper, only one adaptive law needs to be designed for each agent by introducing tuning function. Especially for the higher order of the system, the advantage is more significant. At the same time, the number of design parameters has been greatly reduced.

Stability analysis
So far, according to the backstepping technique, the adaptive tracking controller and adaptive consensus controllers have been completed for strict-feedback nonlinear MASs. Then, by using the above control approach, a theorem can be summarized as follows.

Theorem 1
Consider the adaptive consensus controllers, composed of the virtual controllers (6), (13), (29), (39), (48), the actual controllers (20), (57), and adaptive laws (23), (58), (59), (60). If the parameters 𝑘𝜆,𝜎 satisfy 𝑘𝜆,𝜎>0, then the tracking error and consensus errors asymptotically converge to zero, all the other signals in the systems are bounded, and the consensus control performance is achieved.

Proof
The Lyapunov function V is selected as

𝑉=𝑉0,𝑛+∑𝜏=1𝑁𝑉𝜏,𝑛
(65)
From (24) and (64), one has

𝑉˙=−∑𝜏=0𝑁∑𝜎=1𝑛𝑘𝜏,𝜎𝑠2𝜏,𝜎
(66)
From equation (66), it can be clearly seen that 𝑠𝜏,𝜉, 𝜃̃ 𝜏, 𝜃̃ 𝜏𝑗 and 𝜃̃ 𝜏0 are bounded. As 𝜃𝜏 are bounded, 𝜃̂ 𝜏 are bounded. Because of the boundedness of 𝑦𝑟 and 𝛼𝜏,𝜉 , one can get that all states 𝑥𝜏,𝜉 are bounded.

Due to the boundness of the errors 𝑠𝜏,𝜉, 𝑠˙𝜏,𝜉 are bounded. Therefore, 𝑉¨ is bounded, which implies that 𝑉˙ is uniformly continuous, and

lim𝑡→∞∫𝑡0𝑉˙(𝜍)𝑑𝜍=lim𝑡→∞𝑉(𝑡)−𝑉(0)<∞
(67)
Through the Barbalat’s Lemma, one has

lim𝑡→∞𝑉˙(𝑡)=0
(68)
which means that

lim𝑡→∞𝑠𝜏,𝜉=0
(69)
Therefore, the adaptive tracking error and consensus errors asymptotically converge to zero.

Simulation example
In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method, an example with one leader and four followers is considered as follows

where 𝜃𝑇0=[1,2], 𝜃𝑇1=[4,1], 𝜃𝑇2=[2,3], 𝜃𝑇3=[3,5], 𝜃𝑇4=[5,2], 𝜑0,1=[𝑥20,1,cos(𝑥0,1)]𝑇, 𝜑0,2=[sin(𝑥0,1𝑥0,2),𝑥0,2]𝑇, 𝜑1,1=[𝑥1,1,𝑥21,1]𝑇, 𝜑1,2=[cos(𝑥1,1),𝑥1,2]𝑇, 𝜑2,1=[sin(𝑥2,1),𝑥2,1]𝑇, 𝜑2,2=[𝑥2,2𝑥22,1,sin(𝑥2,2)cos(𝑥2,1)]𝑇, 𝜑3,1=[cos(𝑥3,1)2,𝑥3,1sin(𝑥3,1)]𝑇, 𝜑3,2=[sin(𝑥3,2),𝑥3,2sin(𝑥3,1)]𝑇, 𝜑4,1=[sin(𝑥4,1),𝑥4,1cos(𝑥4,1)]𝑇, 𝜑4,2=[cos(𝑥4,1)sin(𝑥4,2),𝑥4,2]𝑇. The agent is leader when 𝜏=0, otherwise the agent is follower. The reference signal of the leader is 𝑦𝑟=2sin(𝑡)+sin(0.5𝑡).

Choose the initial values as 𝑥0,1(0)=0.5, 𝑥0,2(0)=0.2, 𝑥1,1(0)=0.1, 𝑥1,2(0)=0.3, 𝑥2,1(0)=0.2, 𝑥2,2(0)=0, 𝑥3,1(0)=0.5, 𝑥3,2(0)=0, 𝑥4,1(0)=0.3, 𝑥4,2(0)=0. The initial value of the adaptive law for the leader is chosen as 𝜃̂ 𝑇0(0)=[0,0]. The initial values of the adaptive laws for follower 1 are chosen as 𝜃̂ 𝑇1(0)=[1,2] and 𝜃̂ 𝑇10(0)=[1,2].

By using the above adaptive consensus control approach of nonlinear MASs, the simulation results are given in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Fig. 2 shows that it has good tracking performance of the leader. The good consensus tracking performance of the followers is displayed in Fig. 3. The adaptive tracking controller of leader and adaptive consensus controllers of followers 1–4 are given in Fig. 4. The adaptive laws norm are shown in Fig. 5. Adaptive laws of information exchange followers are displayed in Fig. 6. Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 show that the stability of the MASs is guaranteed by using the above adaptive consensus tracking control approach. Besides, the consensus control performance is achieved.

Conclusion
For strict-feedback nonlinear MASs with unknown parameters and dynamic leader, an adaptive tracking controller and adaptive - have been designed for the leader and followers, respectively. By tuning function method, the number of designed adaptive laws and design parameters has been greatly reduced. The tracking error of the leader and consensus errors of the followers have been proved to asymptotically converge to zero through Lyapunov stability analysis. It has been demonstrated that the proposed adaptive consensus control approach can ensure that all the signals of the systems are bounded. And the consensus control performance is achieved by the dynamic leader output.
