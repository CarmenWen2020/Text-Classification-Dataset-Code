The undrained shear strength of the sensitive clays is an important parameter for the design of the foundation of the civil engineering structures. In this study, novel hybrid machine learning approaches, namely ANFIS-CA and ANFIS-PSO, are developed to predict the undrained shear strength of the sensitive clays. These approaches are based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and two metaheuristic optimizations techniques including cultural algorithm (CA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Unlike other empirical methods that relied on accurate determination of the pre-consolidation pressure, the proposed approaches are based on five reliable input parameters: depth, effective vertical stress, natural water content, liquid limit, and plastic limit. For this purpose, data of 216 sensitive clay samples obtained from different parts of Southern Finland were used for validating and training models. Standard statistical measures were used to evaluate performance of the models. The results show that the proposed hybrid ANFIS-PSO model obtained reasonably good accuracy (correlation coefficient: R = 0.715), in comparison with ANFIS-CA model (R = 0.6) in predicting the undrained shear strength of the sensitive clays. Therefore, the ANFIS-PSO model is very promising to predict the undrained shear strength of the sensitive clays with limited input parameters.

Introduction
Soft sensitive clays are predominant in Scandinavia and Canada. These soils are characterized by high compressibility and low undrained shear strength. In terms of stability calculation, the undrained shear strength should be evaluated carefully for a reliable stability assessment of foundation structures. In practice, the undrained shear strength of sensitive clays is determined using laboratory tests or using the field tests. The accuracy of laboratory tests such as direct shear test or undrained triaxial compression test significantly relies on the quality of the collected sensitive undisturbed clay samples [1, 2], or considerably depends on the friction coefficient of the penetrometers at depth [3, 4]. On the other hand, the field tests’ results (field vane test, piezocone cone penetration test—CPTU) are affected by the adopted experiment techniques [5]. In case the measurement of the undrained shear strength is not available or not reliable, empirical correlation models for sensitive clays are commonly used based on clay properties such as vertical pre-consolidation pressure [6,7,8]. D’Ignazio et al. [9] adopted linear regression analysis for the Finnish sensitive clays to construct the correlation models based on vertical effective stress and over-consolidation ratio. In these empirical correlation models, the pre-consolidation pressure is critical for the correlation. A correct evaluation of the pre-consolidation pressure is critical to assess the undrained shear strength of sensitive clays. However, Mataic et al. [10] showed that the pre-consolidation pressures can vary significantly due to the soil disturbances during sampling which sometimes leads to unreliable values of the pre-consolidation pressures. As such, it is desirable to develop a model to predict the undrained shear strength of the sensitive clays without relying on the value of the pre-consolidation pressure.

In recent years, machine learning (ML) methods have been widely used in geotechnical engineering such as support vector machine (SVM) to predict the friction capacity of driven piles [11] or the shear strength of soil [12], artificial neural network (ANN) to predict bearing capacity of shallow foundations [13] or peak friction angle of soils [14] and regression tree analysis to predict the shear strength of soil [15]. In recent years, hybrid ML models are also widely used in geotechnical studies to improve the prediction capability of combined models in comparison to individual ML models such as the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) and the cuckoo search optimization (CSO) to predict the shear strength of the soil [16], combined XGBoost and RF models, XGBoost-MAPE and RF-MAPE, combined SVR and PSO model [17]. Other hybrid models which have been used to estimate the shear strength of soil include elephant herding optimization (EHO), shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA), salp swarm algorithm (SSA), and wind-driven optimization (WDO) [18]. These hybrid ML models show high potential to predict the shear strength of the insensitive soil; however, they have not been applied so far to predict the undrained shear strength of the sensitive clays which is required for solving geotechnical problems such as slope stability, railway construction and other civil engineering structures, especially in Scandinavian countries.

Therefore, in this study, we have developed two hybrid ML models: ANFIS-CA and ANFIS-PSO, which combine adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with two metaheuristic optimizations techniques, namely cultural algorithm (CA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). We adopt these models, respectively, to estimate the undrained shear strength of the Finnish sensitive clays (F-CLAY/7/216). The advantages of these models are to estimate the undrained shear strength with optimum input parameters in order to avoid the soil disturbance effects on the collected sensitive clays samples. For example, these models do not require to use the pre-consolidation pressures which is a mandatory input of other empirical correlation models. The accuracy of the models was evaluated using the coefficient of correlation method and compared with the results of existing correlation models available in the published literature.

Materials and methods
Data used
Sensitive clays are present in a major part of Southern Finland. These clays were formed in marine sediments during the last glaciations period through slow geological processes. For the model study, 216 soil samples were collected from different areas in Southern Finland (Fig. 1). These data were collected by D’Ignazio et al. [9] and officially used with permission in this study. The data set includes laboratory test results: effective vertical stress (𝜎′v), natural water content (w), liquid limit (LL), and plastic limit (PL) at depth (z). Table 1 shows the initial statistical analysis of the dataset. The depth of samples varied from 0.5 to 24 m. The vertical effective stress is related to the depth, varying from 7.5 to 163 kPa. The distribution of the water content ranges from 25 to 150%, the liquid limit from 22 to 125%, the plastic limit from 10 to 50%. Figure 2 shows the correlation analysis of the parameters used in the modeling.

Methods used
Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)
ANFIS is a hybrid algorithm proposed by Jang [19], which is a combination of fuzzy systems and neural networks, thus, it can have merits of both methods [20]. This algorithm is employed to simulate model performance of nonlinear problems. In general, there are five layers in the ANFIS model, where nodes and node functions (fixed and adaptive nodes) are used to establish each layer [21]. Figure 3 shows a diagram of ANFIS structure with one output (f) and two input values x and y. Two equations of “if … then” rules in the Takagi–Sugeno model can be written as flows:

If𝑥is C1and𝑦is D1, then𝑓1=ℎ1𝑥+𝑙1𝑦+𝑠1(rule1)

If𝑥is C2and𝑦is B2,then𝑓2=ℎ2𝑥+𝑙2𝑦+𝑠2(rule 1)

Particle swarm optimization (PSO)
PSO was primarily recommended by Kennedy and Eberhart [22], which is the most popular algorithm for optimizing parameters of regression and classification problems [23]. The fundamental of the PSO algorithm is based on the biological and social behavior of animals such as a group of birds when searching for food. Each particle treated as a bird in the PSO serves as a potential solution to the problem, and this particle travels randomly in the search space. In this search space, a disruption of a particle is the product of its knowledge and the knowledge of its neighbor particles. Thus, the way of particle seeking is influenced by other particles in the swarm. Specifically, particles learn and exchange knowledge with each other in a flock and advance to the best position based on the knowledge of the swarm. The combination model of PSO optimization technique and other ML models like ANFIS could be very potential in estimating and solving problems [24].

PSO initiates a random flock of particles, in which each particle represents a given answer to the problem. The position of each particle is influenced by the relative distances of surrounding particles during their traveling [25]. For every repetition phase, the location of each individual is amended concerning its existing place and velocity [26]. The following swarm is produced through the position-update of particles that concern the greatest position of each particle (Ibest) and the greatest location of the swarm (Sbest) [27]. The velocity and position of particles can be determined as follows.

𝑉𝑡+1𝑖=𝑤𝑉𝑡𝑖+𝑎1𝑞1(𝐼𝑡best,𝑖−𝑋𝑡𝑖)+𝑎2𝑞2(𝑆𝑡best,𝑖−𝑋𝑡𝑖)
(9)
𝑋𝑡+1𝑖=𝑋𝑡𝑖+𝑉𝑡+1𝑖
(10)
where 𝑉𝑡+1𝑖 and 𝑉𝑡𝑖 denote the velocity at reiteration t and t + 1, respectively; 𝑋𝑡+1𝑖 and 𝑋𝑡𝑖 indicate positions at repetition t and t + 1; a1, a2, and w denote the cognitive influence, social influence parameters, and inertia weight parameter, respectively; q1and q2 indicate random values ranging from 0 to 1; 𝐼𝑡𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡,𝑖 and 𝑆𝑡𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡,𝑖 mean the best individual position and best position of the swarm respectively.

In order to minimize problems, the best locations of individual and swarm in the subsequent repetition are defined using flowing equations [27].

𝐼𝑡+1best,𝑖={𝑋𝑡+1𝑖,𝑓(𝑋𝑡+1𝑖)<𝑓(𝐼𝑡best,𝑖)𝐼𝑡best,𝑖,𝑓(𝑋𝑡+1𝑖)≥𝑓(𝐼𝑡best,𝑖)
(11)
𝑆𝑡+1best=argmin{𝑓(𝐼𝑡+1best,0),...,𝑓(𝐼𝑡+1best,ns),𝑓(𝑆𝑡best)}
(12)
where ns is the number of particles in the swarm. Figure 4 shows a typical structure of PSO algorithm, and Fig. 5 represents pseudocode of PSO.

Cultural algorithm (CA)
Reynolds primarily proposed a cultural algorithm (CA), which was stimulated via human sociology and established to model the development of the cultural constituent of a computational system overtime based on accumulated knowledge [28]. The CA was used to simulate cultural and social changes [29]. Each CA includes two parts namely belief space and population space. These spaces progress and exchange with each other via given protocols. Consequently, CA could generate a precise mechanism for universal knowledge and a valuable algorithm scheme to simulate self-adaption in a system of group intelligence [30, 31], such as PSO [22], genetic algorithm [32], and ant colony optimization [33]. As presented in Fig. 6, CA mainly has three components: communication protocol, population space, and belief space.

Framework of cultural algorithms

The population space is used to model the biological development process from a microscopic point of view, whereas belief space is employed to model society derivation process that includes the establishment and spread of culture from a macroscopic viewpoint. In the progress of evolution, population and belief spaces evolve at the same time and influence each other. The communication process comprises two functions: influence and acceptance function. The individuals contribute their experience to the belief spaced according to the acceptance function, and the individuals in the population are also affected by belief space through influence function. Thus, knowledge of belief and population space interacts as well as helps each other. Even it may take more cost on preserving exchanging knowledge and the belief space, however, if the knowledge that accumulated from the exchange process could guide the optimization process more successfully, and more valuable knowledge can be generated to tackle the problem; as a result, the search process may be needed fewer generations. Thus, it can be said that cultural algorithms may have higher efficiency compared to other biological evolutionary algorithms [29]. CA has some main processes as defined in the following steps. The pseudocode of CA is shown in Fig. 7.

Step 1 Generate belief and population space, then compute randomly all individuals in two spaces; after that, fitness of every individual is evaluated.

Step 2 When the stopping criteria are satisfied, the CA is stopped, otherwise continue step 3.

Step 3 All individuals in both spaces are updated based on their regulations, and the fitness of each individual is assessed.

Step 4 Using acceptation function to update belief space.

Step 5 Using the influence function to update population space.

Step 6 Return back to Step 2.

Quantitative statistical indices
In this research, the common indicators namely root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and correlation coefficient (R) were adopted to compare and validate the predictive ability of algorithms used [34, 35]. Lower values of RMSE and MAE indicate the higher accuracy of the models, whereas a higher value of R means higher accuracy of the models. The value of R ranges from −1 to 1. These statistical indicators (RMSE, MAE, and R) can be computed using the below equations:

𝑅=∑𝑚𝑖=1(𝑦cai−𝑦ca⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯)(𝑦mei−𝑦me⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯)∑𝑚𝑖=1(𝑦cai−𝑦ca⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯)2(𝑦mei−𝑦me⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯)2‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾√

(14)
MAE=1𝑚∑𝑖=1𝑚|𝑦cai−𝑦mei|
(15)
where, 𝑦cai and 𝑦ca⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ are the output value of the specimen ith and the average value of output that computed from the modelling, respectively; 𝑦mei and 𝑦me⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ mean the measured value of the specimen ith and the measured mean value, respectively; and n represents the sum of samples.

Random forest for attribute importance
Random Forest (RF) is a classifier that uses a bagging algorithm to build tree ensembles, with a randomization system for the development of each tree [36]. Particularly, this algorithm is appropriate for datasets with high-dimensional and small-sample [37,38,39]. In RF, variable importance is evaluated by comparing the performance of the predictor from the original data and that obtained from the Out-Of-Bag (OOB) data [40]. It was reported that the accuracy of OOB is always employed to assess the performance of the RF [41]. RF is known as a state-of-art technique of machine learning because of higher accuracy with lower bias compared to other common tree-structured methods such as CART, C4.5, and ID3 [42]. RF generates two variable importance measures, namely mean decrease accuracy (MDA) and mean decrease Gini (MDG). The feature ranking provided by MDG or MDA assists as a sieve to remove inappropriate features, and they have been used in varied domains [38, 43,44,45].

Examining learning circumstances, the data are expressed as z = (x, y), in which x means an example and y indicates the label. The example can be further written as x = (x1, x2, …, xd) ∈ X, where 1, 2, …, d denotes the primary continuation numbers of a feature and d indicates the magnitude of a feature group. A VIM system is implemented, and each feature will be set using an importance score. As a result, the ranking of a feature can be achieved by ordering the score of importance. The ranking of features can be expressed as follows:

RankFeature=(𝑥𝜒(1),𝑥𝜒(2),...,𝑥𝜒(𝑑))
(16)
where 𝜒(𝑗), j = 1, 2, …, d denotes the subsequent index of feature 𝑥𝑗 in the descendant ranking.

In the process of building RF modeling, MDG and MDA have been suggested to assists as variable importance techniques. Assume 𝑘𝑡(𝑥𝑖) and 𝑘𝑡(𝑥𝑗𝑖) denote the estimated label for OOB example xi before and post feature transformation, respectively. The importance of a feature xj is measured by MDA via computing the average decrease the accuracy of OOB before and post the permutation of feature xj; in other words, the importance score (VI) can be calculated as follows.

𝑉𝐼(𝑥𝑗)=1𝑛tree∑𝑡=1𝑛tree∑𝑖∈𝑂𝑂𝐵𝐼(𝑦𝑖=𝑘𝑡(𝑥𝑖))−∑𝑖∈𝑂𝑂𝐵𝐼(𝑦𝑖=𝑘𝑡(𝑥𝑗𝑖))|OOB|
(17)
In terms of MDG, the overall reduction in node impurities (e.g., Gini index) from splitting on the feature, and averaged over all trees is measured.

Presume the Gini index of xj feature is indicated as Gini(j), and ndotre represents the number of tree nodes; thus, the score of importance by MDG is determined as below.

𝑉𝐼(𝑥𝑗)=1𝑛dotre[1−∑𝑘=1𝑛dotreGini(𝑗)𝑘]
(18)
where Gini(𝑗)𝑘 denotes Gini index kth amidst ndotre node of trees.

Methodology
In this study, the CA and PSO methods were used to regulate the value of ANFIS membership functions. Figure 8 presents a diagram and steps of these hybrid models. The optimization process is done as in the following steps:

Step 1 Firstly, the input dataset is loaded and generated, and then these datasets are randomly split into two groups in the ratio of 70:30 for training (70%) data and testing (30%) data. The training data are employed to train the model and testing data to validate the accuracy of the models.

Step 2 All datasets including training and testing are generated and normalized with an interval range of [0,1], to improve the prediction ability of models used. Attribute importance using random forest is employed to evaluate the variable importance of input parameters.

Step 3 FIS generation is implemented. In this phase, the properties of input and output membership function s are defined.

Step 4 FIS generation is used to determine the training algorithms. In this research, two algorithms CA and PSO were used to optimize the ANFIS parameters and to construct the hybrid models (ANFIS-CA and ANFIS-PSO). In the hybrid models, the hyper-parameters used in the training of the models are presented in Tables 2 and 3.

Results and discussion
Selection of important features using random forest (RF)
The selection of important features or attributes plays an important role in selecting input parameters and presenting important relationships between inputs and outputs [17]. RF is considered to be one of the most popular methods of performing this task [46]. Table 4 shows that the vertical effective stress (σ′𝑣) is the most important parameter (weight: 283.330), followed by natural water content (weight: 225.12), plastic limit (weight: 202.74), depth (weight: 164.5), and liquid limit (weight: 127.01), respectively, in the prediction of the undrained shear strength of the sensitive clays using RF method in this study.

Performance evaluation of ANFIS-PSO hybrid model
In this study, 70% of the data were used for training the model to predict the undrained shear strength. The value of RMSE at 500 iterations is in the range of 0.08 to 0.12, which is satisfactory and stable (Fig. 9). However, similar observations for the MAE and R values show that these values vary from 0.06 to 0.09 for MAE and from 0.06 to 0.8 for R. From these results, we can conclude that the ANFIS-PSO performance is satisfactory to predict the undrained shear strength. We also analyzed the correlation analysis of actual and predicted outputs (Fig. 10). The results show that R = 0.9 for the training data and R = 0.715 for the testing data. Error analysis was applied in this study to evaluate performance of the model. Figure 11 shows actual and predicted values of ANFIS-PSO using training dataset and testing dataset, and Fig. 12 shows the error analysis of the model which indicates that RMSE = 0.0713, and MAE = 0.047 for the training data. For validation data, these values are 0.109 for RMSE, and 0.072 for MAE.

Performance evaluation of ANFIS-CA hybrid model
Performance of the ANFIS-CA model was evaluated using the values of RMSE, MAE and R. The values for 500 iterations of RMSE vary from 0.15 to 0.2, and from 0.11 to 0.14 of MAE and from 0.6 to 0.7 of R (Fig. 13). These values indicate that performance of this model is satisfactory in the prediction of the undrained shear strength of sensitive clays. Figure 14 shows that the correlation value of R was 0.673 for training data and 0.601 for testing data. This value is lower than the ones obtained from the ANFIS-PSO model. Figure 15 shows the actual and predicted values of ANFIS-CA using the training dataset and the testing dataset, and Fig. 16 shows the error analysis of the model which indicates the errors less than 10% with RMSE = 0.155, and MAE = 0.123 for the training data. In terms of validation data, these values were 0.185 for RMSE, and 0.121 for MAE.

Comparison of ANFIS-CA, ANFIS-PSO and other machine learning methods
The results show that the CA and PSO succeeded in training the ANFIS algorithm. ANFIS-PSO had a higher accuracy compared to the ANFIS-CA by comparing the errors of the actual data and the prediction data (Fig. 10 and Fig. 14). Also, in the process of 500 iterations, the ANFIS-PSO model exhibits better performance with the set of training data and validation data than the ANFIS-CA model. Other studies also confirm the high accuracy of the ANFIS-PSO model. For example, Le et al. [47] used the ANFIS optimized by Genetic Algorithm (ANFIS-GA) and ANFIS-PSO to predict the critical buckling load of steel columns. The results show that ANFIS-PSO is more effective than ANFIS-GA in training the ANFIS algorithm. The finding of this study is reasonable as ANFIS has the advantages in the learning capacity, more flexible and fewer adjustable parameters than other neural networks due to the benefits of both neural network and fuzzy logic [48]. However, there are disadvantages in determining the membership function. One of the most difficult tasks is the indefinite optimal parameters in the fuzzy neural model [49]. Therefore, we combined ANFIS with PSO and also with CA and developed two hybrid models to overcome these problems. In the case of the PSO algorithm, the particles have been updated with the internal speed with the memories. In addition, this algorithm automatically searched for optimal alternatives in the solution spaces [50]. On the other hand, the CA algorithm has the lowest power to train the ANFIS model compared to the PSO, but it has the lowest processing speed and the highest convergence speed [51].

Furthermore, we have also compared the proposed methods with other existing hybrid methods available in the published literature (Table 5). This study highlighted that the hybrid models commonly gave higher accuracy than the individual models. For example, combining artificial neural network with other optimization methods [52] can increase the accuracy of R from approximately 0.7 to more than 0.9. Overall, the R accuracy of the hybrid methods range from 0.7 to 0.9. Our proposed methods have shown lower accuracy of R compared with other existing hybrid methods in the literature. Reason is that they used to predict the unstructured soils with the clay content of approximately 30%. On the other hand, the sensitive clay in this study is the structured clays which is more challenging to predict the shear strength because this clay is sensitive to the soil disturbance which can change the shear strength significantly to 20–50 times. Thus, despite challenges to predict accurately undrained shear strength of sensitive clays, performance of the proposed model is satisfactory with limited requirement of geotechnical parameters. In addition, there is the potential improvement by new developed fuzzy systems for the prediction modeling in general and for prediction of the geotechnical problems in particular [53,54,55].

Comparison of the results of ANFIS-CA and ANFIS-PSO with correlation equations
The existing correlation among the undrained shear strength (𝑠FVu), the pre-consolidation pressure (𝜎′p) and the liquid index (LL) is suggested by Hansbo (1957) [6] for Scandinavian clays based on the fall cone tests as:

𝑠FVu′p≈0.45LL
(19)
Other correlations are based on the plasticity index (PI) rather than the liquid index (LI). For example, Chandler (1988) [7] suggested a correlation for over-consolidated clays as:

𝑠FVu′p≈0.11+0.0037PI
(20)
On the other hand, Larsson [8] also came up with a similar correlation based on the measurement data of the field vane shear tests as follows:

𝑠FVu′p≈0.08+0.0055PI
(21)
D’Ignazio et al. [9] adopted the linear regression model to develop a set of transformation models for Finnish sensitive clays using vertical effective stress (𝜎′v), over consolidation ratio (OCR = 𝜎′p/𝜎′v) and either of index variables (plasticity index PI, liquid limit LL, water content w, liquid index LI, and sensitivity 𝑆t). For example, one can use the OCR as:

𝑠FVu′𝑣≈0.296OCR0.788w0.337
(22)
Figure 17 shows the correlation results of correlation equations for Finnish sensitive clays. The accuracy of these equations is measured using the coefficient of correlation (R). The correlation coefficient ranges from 0.67 to 0.71 (Table 6). Indeed, these correlation models predict more accurate than the ANFIS-CA model (R = 0.673 for training and R = 0.6 for prediction). On the other hand, the performance of the ANFIS-PSO model (R = 0.9 for training and R = 0.715 for prediction) in predicting the undrained shear strength of the sensitive clays is better than the performance of correlation equations without requiring the pre-consolidation pressure as the input parameters, which is better than other correlation models.

Table 3 summarizes the prediction accuracy of all the models in this study. Based on the results of this study, the key factor of the ANFIS-CA model is the vertical effective stress which is the most important factor to predict the undrained shear strength. The study shows that the ANFIS-PSO model is a promising tool to predict the undrained shear strength of the sensitive clays in case the value of pre-consolidation pressure is not available or not reliable due to sampling disturbances.

Conclusion
In this study, two machine learning hybrid models, namely ANFIS-PSO and ANFIS-CA, were developed to predict the undrained shear strength of the Finnish sensitive clays using five input factors: depth of sample (z), effective vertical stress (𝜎′v), natural water content (w), liquid limit (LL), and plastic limit (PL). Analysis of statistical indices including correlation analysis shows that performance of both the proposed models is satisfactory in predicting the undrained shear strength of the sensitive clays, but the ANFIS-PSO is better than the ANFIS-CA. The implication of this study is that the ANFIS-PSO model can be a good alternative tool to predict the undrained shear strength with limited geotechnical parameters for designing the civil engineering structures in sensitive clays not only in Finland but also in other Scandinavian countries. Further refinement of the models’ performance will be done after the availability of more reliable validated soil testing data. In addition, the further improvement by new developed fuzzy systems can be explored for prediction of the undrained shear strength of soil.
