This paper handles the issue of adaptive control and faults estimation of a class of T-S singular fractional order systems(SFOSs) with 𝐻∞ performance, where the fractional order belongs to (0, 1). Firstly, a novel observer for SFOSs is proposed, which estimate unmeasurable or partially measurable state and faults, simultaneously. Secondly, regarding to the information obtained by the above observer and the designed adaptive parameters, an adaptive controller is proposed to estimate actuator faults of the SFOSs. Further, it is indispensable to ensure the admissibility of the proposed fuzzy SFOSs with 𝐻∞ performance, novel sufficient conditions are obtained by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), Finally, to illustrate the method proposed above is available, simulation examples are presented.

Introduction
In recent years, due to the description is more in line with real life, singular systems, that is, descriptor systems or generalised systems, have been widely conducted in various aspects of control field, such as electromagnetic systems, biological systems, flexible structures [1,2,3]. Generalized systems, which are more superior to complex phenomena than the normal system, so it has attracted the attention of many scholars [4,5,6]. Nevertheless, with the deepening of research, generalized system is far from meeting the needs of normal applications, so the fractional order system has slowly entered our sight. The industrial process has been refined under the fractional derivatives and calculus, which makes the research of fractional order systems(FOSs) very meaningful [7,8,9]. For an operating system, maintaining stable performance is the most valued actual issue. Lots of efficient stability conditions of FOSs have been established in [10,11,12,13]. According to LMIs, the stability analysis of fractional commensurate order systems with the cases of 0<𝛼<2 was presented in [10]. As stated in [13], a novel conceptual unified framework for fractional neural networks was proposed because of fractional calculus has been classified as artificial neural networks. Since these two systems both play a vital role in control theory, the two systems are combined into a complex system, singular fractional order system, which is a new area worthy researching and have achieved abundant research results in recent years [14,15,16]. Guo et al. [14] focused on the stabilization problem for SFOSs by LMIs and a static output feedback controller was designed. In [15], a superior criteria have been put forward by strict LMI approach without equality constraints to obtain the stability of SFOS.

As we all know, in practice, most physical models are nonlinear. The control approach based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems is an efficient way to discuss complex nonlinear systems. Up to now, fuzzy systems have gained widespread attention and significant results have been published for T-S fuzzy systems [17,18,19,20]. With a novel fuzzy observer and membership functions, Wang et al. [17] designed an algorithm and a novel controller to guarantee the asymptotically stable of the fuzzy 𝐻∞ systems. Han et al. [18] addressed the application of multi-dimensional T-S fuzzy systems to eliminate the impact of failures. In [19], the novel descriptor observer and controller were designed to estimate faults, external noise and promoted the transformed closed-loop system to be asymptotically stable. Afterwards, an adaptive sliding mode controller strategy, whose sliding surface has already been constructed to process T-S fuzzy SFOSs with unknown constants in [21]. In order to be more realistic and achieve better performance, Asemani et al. [22] proposed sufficient conditions for stabilizing and designed a robust 𝐻∞ observed-based controller for T-S fuzzy systems with uncertainty by LMI.

In fact, due to engineering and practical applications, it is inevitable that faults always exist, which requires many experts to spend a lot of energy to eliminate [23,24,25,26]. Compared with traditional feedback control, adaptive control design can better deal with the uncertainties in system dynamics and failures that may occur during system operation. In [26], a novel way is proposed to rape with the unknown singular systems by transforming it into the non-singular form with faults. Furthermore, an adaptive neural network approximation model for a nonlinear function is given. The key to the design task is to find a suitable adaptive law and a matched controller, so that under the condition of model matching, the adaptive controller still automatically adjust the remaining controller even though other actuators in the control system have unknown failures, which eventually achieve the desired control objective [27,28,29]. For the in-depth study, it is necessary to research the specific system, whose development is not completed, and there are still some aspects worth complementing.

Motivated by the above discussions, as a result of the increase in engineering accuracy requirements, it is inevitable to study the issue of adaptive observer for T-S fuzzy singular FOSs, which have not been studied completely. The contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:

1.
A new adaptive observer based on fault-tolerant control for SFOSs is proposed by designing sliding mode reaching law, which ensure that the stability of T-S fuzzy SFOSs and the regular condition towards the sliding surface has been improved.

2.
A convex combination technique is developed, such that the proposed fault-tolerant control way is valid for the fuzzy systems with faults.

3.
Due to the information obtained by the above observer and the designed adaptive parameters, according to the adaptive control law, an adaptive observer-based controller is proposed, which is more practical to estimate actuator faults of the SFOSs. The stability conditions in this paper reduce the conservatism and computational burden.

4.
Further, novel sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the stability ofthe proposed T-S fuzzy SFOSs with 𝐻∞ performance in terms of LMI. Compared with the existed references, the 𝐻∞ control method is more concise and more convenient for calculation with faults. Finally, to illustrate the proposed method is available, numerical examples are presented.

The rest of the paper is divided into the following sections. Section 2 presents some basic formula expressions. Section 3 gives an account of main results of the paper. In Sect. 4, numerical examples are given to display the validity of the theorem we proposed and Sect. 5 is the conclusion of the paper.

Notation: Here, it gives the definition of the symbols used in this paper. 𝑋𝑇 expresses the transposition of the matrix X. sym{𝑋} means the form of 𝑋+𝑋𝑇. ∗ notes a corresponding symmetric matrix. If there is no special description, for the dimensions of the matrix, which should be compatible.

Problem formulation and preliminaries
In this part, some preliminary for T-S fuzzy singular fractional order systems are given.

Definition 1
[11] The Caputo derivative of f(t) is expressed as follows , where 𝛼 belongs (0, 1) : 

𝑐𝐷𝛼𝑡𝑥(𝑡)=𝑑𝛼𝑓(𝑡)𝑑𝑡𝛼=1𝛤(𝜍−𝛼)∫𝑡0𝑓(𝜍)(𝜏)(𝑡−𝜏)𝛼+1−𝜍𝑑𝜏,
(1)
where 𝜍−1<𝛼≤𝜍,𝜍∈𝑍+, and 𝛤(𝑥)=∫∞0𝑒−𝑡𝑡𝑥−1𝑑𝑡 is gamma function. For convenience, we simplify 𝑐𝐷𝛼𝑡𝑥(𝑡) to  𝐷𝛼𝑥(𝑡).

Immediately afterwards, the continuous-time fuzzy T-S singular fractional order systems is given as follows:

𝑅𝑖(𝑡): IF 𝜇1(𝑡) is 𝐷1𝑖, 𝜇2(𝑡) is 𝐷12,..., 𝜇𝑗(𝑡) is 𝐷1𝑗, THEN

{𝐸𝐷𝛼𝑥(𝑡)=𝐴𝑖𝑥(𝑡)+𝐵𝑖(𝑢(𝑡)+𝑓𝑎(𝑡)),𝑦(𝑡)=𝐶𝑖𝑥(𝑡).                 
(2)
where i is the number of IF-THEN rules, 𝑖=1,2,...,𝑟. 𝐷𝑖𝑗 are the fuzzy sets, 𝑥(𝑡)∈ℝ𝑛 stands state vector, 𝑢(𝑡)∈ℝ𝑚 represents control input, 𝑓𝑎(𝑡) means actuator faults. 𝐴𝑖,𝐵𝑖,𝐶𝑖 are constant matrices. 𝐸∈ℝ𝑛 and rank(𝐸)=𝑟<𝑛, which is singular. Afterwards, the overall T-S fuzzy SFOSs are expressed as follows:

⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪𝐸𝐷𝛼𝑥(𝑡)=∑𝑖=1𝑟ℎ𝑖(𝜇(𝑡)){𝐴𝑖𝑥(𝑡)+𝐵𝑖(𝑢(𝑡)+𝑓𝑎(𝑡))},𝑦(𝑡)=∑𝑖=1𝑟ℎ𝑖(𝜇(𝑡))𝐶𝑖𝑥(𝑡).                    
(3)
where ℎ𝑖(𝜇(𝑡))=𝜛𝑖(𝜇(𝑡))∑𝑟𝑖=1𝜛𝑖(𝜇(𝑡)), 𝜛𝑖(𝜇(𝑡))=∏𝑝𝑗=1𝐷𝑖𝑗(𝜇𝑗(𝑡)), in which 𝐷𝑖𝑗(𝜇𝑗(𝑡)) are the grade of membership of 𝜇𝑗(𝑡) in 𝐷𝑖𝑗. If 𝜛𝑖(𝜇(𝑡))>0, then, ∑𝑟𝑖=1𝜛𝑖(𝜇(𝑡))≥0. Therefore, ℎ𝑖(𝜇(𝑡))≥0, ∑𝑟𝑖=1ℎ𝑖(𝜇(𝑡))=1.

In addition, the fault-tolerant control problem is investigated. The next step is to devise an adaptive control law that forces the system state to reach the sliding surface under possible actuator fault. The detailed flow diagram of the proposed approach is shown in Fig. 1 to clarify the design procedure and structure.

Next, in order to achieve our objective, some Lemmas are needed in the sequel.

Definition 2
[30] For a generalized fractional order system 𝐸𝐷𝛼(𝑡)=𝐴𝑥(𝑡), which is said to be regular if det(𝑠𝛼𝐸−𝐴) is not identially zero. When deg(det(𝑠𝐸−𝐴))=rank(𝐸), unforced SFOSs are impulse free, which is also stable as the generalized eigenvalues of det(𝜆𝐸−𝐴)=0 lying in 𝐷𝛼={𝜆:|𝑎𝑟𝑔(𝜆)|>𝛼𝜋2}. SFOSs are admissibile if the above three conditions are fulfilled.

Lemma 1
[15] The singular FOS in Definition 2 with 0<𝛼<1 is admissible iff there exist matrices X and Y, P satisfying

[𝐸𝑋−𝐸𝑌𝐸𝑌𝐸𝑋]=[𝑋𝑇𝐸𝑇𝑌𝑇𝐸𝑇−𝑌𝑇𝐸𝑇𝑋𝑇𝐸𝑇]≥0,
(4)
and

sym{𝑟𝐴𝑇𝑃}<0.
where 𝑟=𝑒𝑗(1−𝛼)𝜋2.

Lemma 2
[14] Suppose SFOS in Definition 2 is regular, and M and N are invertible matrices such that

𝑀𝐸𝑁=[𝐼𝑚00𝑁𝑛−𝑚], 𝑀𝐴𝑁=[𝐴1¯00𝐼𝑛−𝑚],
(5)
where 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝐴1¯)>0,𝑁𝑛−𝑚 is nilpotent matrix.

When the regularity of SFOS in definition 2 is unknown, and M and N are invertible matrices such that

𝑀𝐸𝑁=[𝐼𝑚000],𝑀𝐴𝑁=[𝐴11𝐴21𝐴12𝐴22]
(6)
Lemma 3
[31] A, B are known matrices and 𝛩∈H𝑛,𝛷∈H2,𝛺∈H2. Define 𝛬 as follows,

𝛬(𝛷,𝛺)={𝜆∈𝐶|[𝜆1]∗𝛷[𝜆1]=0,[𝜆1]∗𝛹[𝜆1]≥0}.
Then, there exist 𝑃,𝑄>0 such that

[𝐴𝐸𝐵0]∗(𝛷⊗𝑃+𝛹⊗𝑄)[𝐴𝐸𝐵0]+𝛩<0
Lemma 4
[30] Suppose 𝑆1 and 𝑆3 are symmetric matrices and 𝑆2 is constants matrix, then 𝑆1+𝑆2𝑆−13𝑆𝑇2<0 iff

[𝑆1𝑆𝑇2𝑆2𝑆3]<0.
Lemma 5
[9] Suppose D and E are constant matrices and S is a symmetric matrix, which satisfy the following inequality 𝑆+𝐷𝐹𝐸+(𝐷𝐹𝐸)𝑇<0 with F satisfying 𝐹𝑇𝐹≤𝐼, if and only if for some 𝜀>0,

𝑆+[𝐸𝑇𝐷][𝜀−1𝐼00𝜀𝐼][𝐸𝐷𝑇]<0
Main results
Adaptive observer design
First, based on the adaptive control strategy, an observer is designed.

⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪𝐸𝐷𝛼𝑥̂ (𝑡)=∑𝑖=1𝑟ℎ𝑖(𝜇(𝑡)){𝐴𝑖𝑥̂ (𝑡)+𝐿𝑖(𝑦(𝑡)−𝑦̂ (𝑡))},𝑦̂ (𝑡)=∑𝑖=1𝑟ℎ𝑖(𝜇(𝑡))𝐶𝑖𝑥̂ (𝑡).                  
(7)
Subsequently, 𝑒(𝑡)=𝑥(𝑡)−𝑥̂ (𝑡) means the error of state variable and 𝑒𝑦(𝑡)=𝑦(𝑡)−𝑦̂ (𝑡) represents the error of output variable. Therefore, the above-mentioned equivalent adaptive fuzzy controller can be rephrased into the following form:

𝑢𝑎(𝑡)=∑𝑗=1𝑟ℎ𝑗(𝜇(𝑡)){𝑖𝑥̂ (𝑡)−(𝐻𝑗𝐵𝑗)−1𝐻𝑗𝐴𝑗𝑒(𝑡)−𝑓𝑎(𝑡)},
(8)
where 𝐻𝑖,𝑖 are constant matrices under the constraint condition det(𝐻𝑖𝐵𝑖)≠0. Next, the error system is given as follows:

⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪𝐸𝐷𝛼𝑒(𝑡)=∑𝑖=1𝑟ℎ𝑖(𝜇(𝑡)){(𝐴𝑖−𝐿𝑖𝐶𝑖)𝑒(𝑡)+𝐵𝑖𝑖𝑥̂ −𝐵𝑖(𝐻𝑖𝐵𝑖)−1𝐻𝑖𝐴𝑖)𝑒(𝑡)},𝑒𝑦(𝑡)=∑𝑖=1𝑟ℎ𝑖(𝜇(𝑡))𝐶𝑖𝑒(𝑡).                                                       
(9)
Substituting the equivalent control law (8) into (3) and defining 𝜉(𝑡)=[𝑥𝑇(𝑡)𝑒𝑇(𝑡)]𝑇, the error dynamic can be acquired as:

𝐸𝐷𝛼𝜉(𝑡)=∑𝑖=1𝑟ℎ𝑖(𝜇(𝑡))𝐴¯𝑖𝜉(𝑡)
(10)
where 𝐴¯𝑖=[𝐴𝑖+𝐵𝑖𝑖𝐴𝑖−𝐿𝑖𝐶𝑖−𝐵𝑖𝑖−𝐺𝑖𝐴𝑖−𝐵𝑖𝑖−𝐺𝑖𝐴𝑖𝐵𝑖𝑖,], 𝐺𝑖=𝐵𝑖(𝐻𝑖𝐵𝑖)−1𝐻𝑖.

Admissibility analysis
In this section, we consider the issue of the admissibility of closed-loop error dynamic system (10). In order to simplify, we make the following equivalent transformation of the symbol. ℎ𝜇=∑𝑖=1𝑟ℎ𝑖(𝜇(𝑡)),𝐴¯ℎ=ℎ𝜇𝐴¯𝑖,𝐶ℎ=ℎ𝜇𝐶𝑖,𝐺ℎ=ℎ𝜇𝐺𝑖,𝐿ℎ=ℎ𝜇𝐿𝑖,ℎ=ℎ𝜇𝑖.

Theorem 1
T-S singular FOS (3) is asymptotically stable with adaptive controller (8) and the fractional order belongs to 0<𝛼<1 if X is symmetric matrix and 𝑃1𝑖>0,𝑃2𝑖>0,𝑌 are constant matrices and a scalar 𝛽>0 satisfying the following LMIs:

[𝐸𝑋−𝐸𝑌𝐸𝑌𝐸𝑋]=[𝑋𝑇𝐸𝑇𝑌𝑇𝐸𝑇−𝑌𝑇𝐸𝑇𝑋𝑇𝐸𝑇]≥0,
(11)
sym(𝑟(𝐴¯𝑇ℎ𝑃)<0.
(12)
where

𝑃=[𝑃1𝑖00𝛽𝑃2𝑖],𝑟=𝑒𝑗𝜋2𝛼𝜔𝛼.
Proof
Substituting 𝐴¯ℎ, and P into (12), we can obtain the inequality (13), then, the following results are given:

sym[𝑟(𝐴𝑖+𝐵𝑖𝑖)𝑇𝑃1𝑖−𝑟(𝐵𝑖𝑖+𝐺¯𝑖𝐴¯𝑖)𝑇𝑃1𝑖−𝑟𝛽(𝐵𝑖𝑖)𝑇𝑃2𝑖𝑟(𝐴𝑖−𝐿𝑖𝐶𝑖−𝐵𝑖𝑖−𝐺¯𝑖𝐴𝑖)𝑇𝑃2𝑖𝑟(𝐵𝑖𝑖)𝑇𝑃2𝑖]<0,
(13)
𝑟(𝐴ℎ+𝐵ℎℎ)𝑇𝑃1𝑖+𝑟∗𝑃𝑇1𝑖(𝐴ℎ+𝐵ℎℎ)<0.
(14)
As a result of lemma 1, T-S singular FOS (10) is asymptotically stable.

Remark 1
It is obvious that the inequality (11) in Theorem 1, is not strict LMIs, which contains constraints condition and make calculation difficult. To solve the problem, matrix S is given, satisfying 𝐸𝑆=0 and we give the following Theorem.

Theorem 2
T-S singular FOS (3) is asymptotically stable with adaptive controller (8) and the fractional order belongs to 0<𝛼<1 if there exists real symmetric matrices X, Y,  𝑃,𝑄𝑖 satisfying the following LMIs:

[𝑋−𝑌𝑌𝑋]>0,
(15)
sym{𝑟𝐴¯𝑇ℎ(𝑃𝐸𝑇+𝑆𝑄ℎ)+𝑟∗𝐴¯ℎ𝑌𝐸𝑇}<0.
(16)
After that, since the proof method is similar to Theorem 1, it will not be explained in detail herein.

Adaptive laws design
In this part, an adaptive law is designed to guarantee the error system reach stability state in a limited time. In order to be necessary, we pull in the following assumption.

Assumption 1
The subsystem of the error dynamic system (9) is bounded and satisfying

sup0≤𝑡<∞‖𝑒(𝑡)‖≤𝛿𝑖,𝑖=1,2,...,𝑟
where 𝛿𝑖 are known positive constant.

Subsequently, we give the adaptive control laws, whose parameters are given below. The adaptive parameters 𝛿̂ 𝑖,𝛾̂ 𝑖1,𝛾̂ 𝑖2 to estimate 𝛿𝑖,𝛾𝑖1,𝛾𝑖2, respectively. The estimation errors are expressed as follows:

𝛿̃ 𝑖=𝛿̂ 𝑖−𝛿𝑖,𝛾̃ 𝑖1=𝛾̂ 𝑖1−𝛾𝑖1,𝛾̃ 𝑖2=𝛾̂ 𝑖2−𝛾𝑖2.
Then, we propose the adaptive controller laws such that the reachability condition is obtained.

𝑢𝑖𝑐(𝑡)=𝑖𝑥(𝑡)−(𝐻𝑖𝐵𝑖)−1{−𝐻𝑖𝑇𝑖𝐶𝑖𝑒(𝑡)+𝜈𝑖(𝑡)‖𝜈𝑖(𝑡)‖ (‖𝐻𝑖𝐴𝑖+𝑇𝑖𝐶𝑖‖𝛿̂ 𝑖+‖𝐻𝑖𝐵𝑖‖𝛾̂ 𝑖1+‖𝐻𝑖𝐵𝑖‖‖𝑦(𝑡)‖𝛾̂ 𝑖2+𝜀0)}
(17)
⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪𝐸1𝐷𝛼𝛿̂ 𝑖=𝜎1𝑖‖𝜈𝑖(𝑡)‖‖𝐻𝑖𝐴𝑖+𝑇𝑖𝐶𝑖‖,𝐸1𝐷𝛼𝛾̂ 𝑖1=𝜎2𝑖‖𝜈𝑖(𝑡)‖‖𝐻𝑖𝐵𝑖‖,𝐸1𝐷𝛼𝛾̂ 𝑖2=𝜎3𝑖‖𝜈𝑖(𝑡)‖‖𝐻𝑖𝐵𝑖‖‖𝑦(𝑡)‖.
(18)
where 𝜎1𝑖,𝜎2𝑖,𝜎3𝑖,𝜀0 are positive scalar, 𝐸1=𝑀𝐸𝑁=[𝐼𝑚00𝑁𝑛−𝑚] is defined in lemma 2, 𝜈𝑖(𝑡) is continuous differentiable function, whose expression is given in (19) below and 𝑇𝑖 is constant known matrix.

Afterwards, in order to prove that the designed controller make the system stable in a finite time, we propose a Lyapunov functional candidate.

𝑉𝑖(𝑡)=12𝜈𝑇𝑖(𝑡)𝜈𝑖(𝑡)+12𝜎1𝑖𝛿̃ 2𝑖+12𝜎2𝑖𝛾̃ 2𝑖1+12𝜎3𝑖𝛾̃ 2𝑖2
(19)
Calculating the fractional derivative of 𝑇𝑖(𝑡), then

{𝐸1𝐷𝛼𝑉𝑖(𝑡)=𝐸1𝐷𝛼{𝜈𝑇𝑖(𝑡)𝜈𝑖(𝑡)+1𝜎1𝑖𝛿̃ 𝑖𝛿̂ 𝑖+1𝜎2𝑖𝛾̃ 𝑖1𝛾̂ 𝑖1+1𝜎3𝑖𝛾̃ 𝑖2𝛾̂ 𝑖2},𝜈𝑖(𝑡)=ℎ𝜇{𝐻𝑖𝐸1𝐷𝛼−1𝑒(𝑡)−𝐻𝑖∫𝑡0𝐿𝑖𝐶𝑖𝑒(𝑠)𝑑𝑠}.
(20)
Substituting (17) into (19), the following inequality is given.

⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪𝐸1𝐷𝛼𝑉𝑖(𝑡)≤∥𝜈𝑖(𝑡)∥𝑇𝐸1𝐷𝛼∥𝜈𝑖(𝑡)∥+𝐸1𝐷𝛼{1𝜎1𝑖𝛿̃ 𝑖𝛿̂ 𝑖+1𝜎2𝑖𝛾̃ 𝑖1𝛾̂ 𝑖1+1𝜎3𝑖𝛾̃ 𝑖2𝛾̂ 𝑖2}=∥𝜈𝑖(𝑡)∥{‖𝐻𝑖𝐴𝑖+𝑇𝑖𝐶𝑖‖𝛿̃ 𝑖       +‖𝐻𝑖𝐵𝑖‖𝛾̃ 𝑖1+‖𝐻𝑖𝐵𝑖‖‖𝑦(𝑡)‖𝛾̃ 𝑖2+𝜀0}   +1𝜎1𝑖𝛿̃ ˙𝑖𝛿̂ ˙𝑖+1𝜎2𝑖𝛾̃ ˙𝑖1𝛾̂ ˙𝑖1+1𝜎3𝑖𝛾̃ ˙𝑖2𝛾̂ ˙𝑖2  
(21)
Then, to exchange (18) into (21), it obtains,

𝐸1𝐷𝛼𝑉𝑖(𝑡)≤−𝜀0∥𝜈𝑖(𝑡)∥<0.
(22)
After that, it prove that the designed controller make the error system stable in a finite time.

Remark 2
In practical applications, Under normal circumstances, e(t) is unknown or difficult to obtain directly, so we usually find 𝑒𝑦(𝑡) to obtain e(t) according to the equation 𝑒𝑦(𝑡)=𝐶𝑒(𝑡).

𝐻∞ performance control of T-S singular FOS
The control problem of continuous time T-S fuzzy SFOSs with 𝐻∞ performance is considered in this section.

Definition 3
[31] The 𝑇𝑤𝑧 is defined as the transfer function of the system (3) in the following form:

𝑇𝑤𝑧=𝐶𝑖(𝑠𝛼𝐸−𝐴𝑖)−1𝐵𝑖+𝐷𝑖,
(23)
   Then, in frequency domain, the 𝐻∞ norm is defined as follows:

‖𝑇𝑤𝑧‖∞=sup𝜔𝜎¯(𝑇𝑤𝑧(𝑗𝜔)),𝜔≥0.
(24)
Theorem 3
Continuous time T-S singular FOS (10) is asymptotically stable with fractional order belonging 0<𝛼<1 and ‖𝑇𝑤𝑧‖∞<𝛾, if there exists matrices 𝑃1𝑖>0,𝑃2𝑖>0,𝑍1𝑖>0,𝑍2𝑖>0 and a scalar 𝛽>0 such that (15) and the follow LMIs satisfied:

⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢sym{𝑟𝐴¯𝑇ℎ𝑃}+𝛬∗∗𝑟∗(𝑍𝑇−𝑃𝑇)−𝛾𝐼∗𝐶¯𝑇𝐷¯𝑇−𝛾𝐼⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥<0,
(25)
where 𝐴¯ℎ is consistent with Theorem 1, and

𝑍=[𝑍1𝑖−𝛽𝑃2𝑖𝑍2𝑖𝛽𝑃2𝑖],𝑃=[𝑃1𝑖00𝛽𝑃2𝑖],𝐶¯ℎ=[𝐶𝑖00𝐶𝑖],𝐷¯=[𝐷𝑖00𝐷𝑖],𝛬=[000−𝛾𝐼].
(26)
Proof
Substituting 𝐴¯ℎ,𝐶¯ℎ,𝑍,𝐷¯,𝑃,𝛬 into (25), it obtains that:

[⋁∗𝑟∗(𝑍𝑇−𝑃𝑇)−𝛾𝐼]<0.
(27)
where

⋁=sym{𝑟𝐴¯𝑇𝑖𝑃}+𝛬+𝛾−1𝐷¯𝑇𝐷¯+𝛾−1𝐶¯𝑇𝐶¯.
(28)
due to the inequality (27), it obtains that: ⋁<0, which is expressed in (29), ⋁=

sym{𝑟⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢(𝐴𝑖+𝐵𝑖𝑖)𝑇𝑃1𝑖−(𝐵𝑖𝑖+𝐺¯𝑖𝐴¯𝑖)𝑇𝑃1𝑖−𝛽(𝐵𝑖𝑖)𝑇𝑃2𝑖∗                                             (𝐴𝑖−𝐿𝑖𝐶𝑖−𝐵𝑖𝑖−𝐺¯𝑖𝐴𝑖)𝑇𝑃2𝑖(𝐵𝑖𝑖)𝑇𝑃2𝑖∗𝑍1𝑖−𝑃1𝑖−𝛽𝑃2𝑖−𝛾𝐼⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥}<0,
(29)
𝛩=sym{𝑟𝛾(𝐴¯𝑖+𝐵𝑖𝑖)𝑇𝑃1𝑖}+𝐷¯𝑇𝐷¯,
(30)
then,

−𝛩−𝐶¯𝑇𝐶¯>0.
(31)
   Since the continuous time system (10) is admissibile, pre- and post-multiplying (31) by 𝐵𝑇𝑖(𝑠𝛼𝐸−𝐴¯𝑖)−𝑇 and its transform, respectively, we have that,

𝛶=𝛾2𝐼−𝐵𝑇𝑖(𝑠𝛼𝐸−𝐴¯𝑖)−𝑇𝐶¯𝑇𝐶¯(𝑠𝛼𝐸−𝐴¯𝑖)𝐵𝑇𝑖,
(32)
where 𝛾2𝐼>0. Then, the above inequality can be converted into

𝛶−𝐵𝑇𝑖(𝑠𝛼𝐸−𝐴¯𝑖)−𝑇𝛩(𝑠𝛼𝐸−𝐴¯𝑖)𝐵𝑇𝑖>0,
    From lemma 3 and substitute 𝛹,𝛺, we have that:

[𝐴¯𝑖𝐸𝐵𝑖0]𝑇(𝛷⊗𝑍+𝛹⊗𝑃)[𝐴¯𝑖𝐸𝐵𝑖0]+[𝛩00−𝛶]<0,
(33)
where

𝛷=[0𝑒−𝑗𝜃𝑒𝑗𝜃0],𝛹=[0𝑒𝑗𝜃𝑒−𝑗𝜃0].
    Further, 𝛶>0, it means that ‖𝑇𝑤𝑧‖∞<𝛾. The proof of the theorem has been completed.

Theorem 4
Continuous time T-S singular fractional order system (10) is output-feedback stabilizable if there exists matrices 𝑃1𝑖>0,𝑃2𝑖>0, and 𝑍𝑗𝑖(𝑗=1,2,...,6),𝑄𝑗𝑖(𝑗=1,2,...,8),𝐽,𝑀,𝑁, are constant matrices and a scalar 𝛽>0 such that (15) and the LMI (34), which is at the top of next page, satisfied:

Theorem 4 can be regarded as the extension of Theorem 3, so the proof is not expressed in detail.

Numerical examples are given to show the validity of the above approach in this section.

The following fuzzy singular fractional order systems are considered with two fuzzy rules and the parameter matrices are described as follows.

(35)
where

Figures 1a–c shows 𝑥𝑖(𝑡)(𝑖=1,2,3) can be estimated and tracked accurately under observer-based adaptive fault-tolerant controller, whose curves are depicted in Fig. 2. After that, under the effect of the adaptive parameters, which is shown in Fig. 3, we get that the error system in Fig. 1d converges to zero, so that dynamic system (35) is asymptotically stable and Theorem 3 is valid.

Example 2
Considering electrical circuit shown in Fig. 5, which are widely used, including the following circuit element, a load resistance R,  source voltage 𝑒1,𝑒2, and capacitances 𝐶1,𝐶2,𝐶3. Then, the circuit symbols are given , 𝑢1(𝑡),𝑢2(𝑡),𝑢3(𝑡) represent the voltage of capacitances, respectively. Afterwards, the state equation is given as follows,

⎡⎣⎢⎢𝑅𝐶1𝐶100𝐶200−𝐶30⎤⎦⎥⎥⎡⎣⎢⎢𝐷𝛼𝑢1(𝑡)𝐷𝛼𝑢2(𝑡)𝐷𝛼𝑢3(𝑡)⎤⎦⎥⎥=⎡⎣⎢⎢010−1−21220⎤⎦⎥⎥⎡⎣⎢⎢𝑢1(𝑡)𝑢2(𝑡)𝑢3(𝑡)⎤⎦⎥⎥+⎡⎣⎢⎢100001⎤⎦⎥⎥[𝑒1𝑒2]
where 𝛼=0.25, 𝐶1=𝐶2=𝐶3=1, 𝑅=1, 𝑓𝑎(𝑡)={0,1𝑠𝑖𝑛(0.5𝑡−5),𝑡<2𝑡≥2, 

ℎ1(𝜇(𝑡))=1+𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑥1(𝑡))6,ℎ2(𝜇(𝑡))=1−ℎ1(𝜇(𝑡)).
Due to Theorem 2 and solving inequalities (15) and (16), it obtains a series of feasible solutions as follows:

𝑋=⎡⎣⎢⎢2.6613−0.88710.0534−0.88710.2957−0.01780.0534−0.01783.1853⎤⎦⎥⎥,𝑌=⎡⎣⎢⎢1.1978−0.4285−0.50390.4285−0.3406−1.21050.50391.2105−3.0381⎤⎦⎥⎥,𝑃=⎡⎣⎢⎢2.77783.9200−0.82963.92001.14220.5348−0.82960.5348−2.7944⎤⎦⎥⎥,𝑄=[−0.30380.3467−1.2055],𝐿=[0.4854−0.6179−0.1441]𝑇.

Remark 3
Through the above table, We extend the stability of the SFOS to fuzzy T-S systems. Compared with [15], our approach is easy to solve. We reduce the conservative for stabilization and own practical applications. [9] constructed a sliding surface with reduced dimension by the method of state transformation but increases the computational burden. In general, our result is better and stronger than the existing results.

Conclusion
This paper deals with the issue of adaptive control of T-S singular FOSs with faults and 𝐻∞ performance, where the fractional order belongs to (0, 1). Firstly, according to adaptive laws and fuzzy approximation technology, an adaptive observer has been given to dedicate to guarantee the preset tracking performance, which keep the estimation of the unmeasurable or partially measurable state and faults, simultaneously. Secondly, a controller has been designed through constructing the sliding mode surface of fuzzy singular fractional order systems with adaptive sliding mode control strategy. Moreover, a convex combination technique has been developed, such that it is shown that the proposed approach is valid for the systems with faults and unknown disturbances. Further, in order to ensure the stability of the proposed system with 𝐻∞ performance, novel sufficient conditions have been obtained by LMIs, Finally, to illustrate the availability of the presented method, numerical simulation and practical examples have been presented.
