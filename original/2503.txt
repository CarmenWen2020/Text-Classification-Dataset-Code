This paper considers the stabilization of stochastic delayed networks with Markovian switching via aperiodically intermittent control (AIC). The concepts of average control ratio and average control period are proposed to characterize the distributions of control and rest intervals of AIC. It should be noted that the averaging technique used here is more general and less restrictive than the quasi-periodicity condition and minimum control ratio condition used in previous works. Then two kinds of stabilization criteria are obtained: (1) the upper bound of time delay should be less than the average control width; (2) the upper bound of time delay has no relationship with the average control width. Finally, the results are applied to studying the stabilization of coupled stochastic neural networks with Markovian switching via AIC. Numerical simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of obtained results.

Introduction
Over the past decade, much effort has been dedicated to investigating the dynamics of complex networks due to their wide applications in different fields [1, 37, 40]. It should be noted that networks in real-world applications are often subjected to stochastic perturbations, which may be caused by external random fluctuations or other random factors in the process of transmission [14, 29, 39, 42, 43, 50]. For the constructive role of noise in nonlinear dynamical systems, please refer to [9] for details. On the other hand, in order to model the abrupt variations in systems’ structure, Markovian switching systems have also received much attention [32]. In many situations, stochastic perturbations and Markovian switching phenomena are found existing in one process simultaneously [30, 48]. Therefore, it is of great interest to study the dynamics, like stability, synchronization, eta., of stochastic complex networks with Markovian switching. Some related results have been reported (see, e.g., [17, 21]).

In recent years, a kind of discontinuous control named intermittent control has been widely used for the stabilization and synchronization of networks since this control strategy can reduce the cost and prolong the controller’s working life. In existing works, the intermittent control is mainly classed into the event/state-driven intermittent control (the controller is activated when a pre-given event occurs) [7, 12] and time-driven intermittent control (the controller is activated at pre-specified time intervals) [2, 24, 31, 52]. As for the time-driven intermittent control, according to the pre-specified time intervals, it can be classified into periodically intermittent control (PIC) [2, 8, 31] and aperiodically intermittent control (AIC) [24, 52]. In [26,27,28], Liu and Chen first studied the synchronization of coupled networks with and without time delay via AIC. Then based on [26,27,28], various extensions have been made for the stabilization or synchronization of different types of coupled networks via AIC. For example, in [3], based on a matrix omega-measure approach, the synchronization of switched complex networks with unstable modes was investigated via AIC. In [11], the synchronization of neural networks with reaction-diffusion terms via AIC was investigated. In [19], the stabilization analysis of coupled hybrid stochastic networks with multiple delays via AIC was carried out. It should be noted that in above references about the time-driven AIC, the quasi-periodicity condition (see, e.g., [3, 19, 27, 45, 49]) or the minimum control ratio condition (see, e.g., [11, 27, 44, 45, 53]) is imposed to characterize the aperiodicity of AIC. Actually, the two constraints are still conservative and may not satisfy the requirements in many real applications. For example, wind power generation is typically aperiodically intermittent and is completely irregular. It is usually unreasonable to require the length of each wind time. But we can approximately obtain the average length of wind over a unit time [47]. Therefore, it may be more practical to describe the distribution of control and rest intervals of AIC from the average sense, which will make the results more effective for wider applications.

On the other hand, it is well known that time delay is often encountered in many practical systems [41]. The existence of time delay may result in undesired dynamics. Ignoring them may bring about incorrect analytical conclusions. So, it is necessary to take time delay into account when investigating the stability of stochastic networks. In [3, 19, 45, 49], the authors considered the stabilization or synchronization of coupled stochastic networks with time-varying delay via AIC, respectively, where the upper bound of the time-varying delay was required to be less than the lower bound of all control widths. In [11, 45], no restriction was imposed on the upper bound of time-varying delay and the control (and/or rest) widths of AIC. In [27], both the two types of time delay were studied, but the quasi-periodicity condition or the minimum control ratio condition mentioned in above paragraph was imposed.

Motivated by above discussions, this paper aims to investigate the stabilization problem of stochastic delayed networks with Markovian switching via AIC from the average viewpoint. Two concepts, average control ratio and average control period, are proposed to characterize the aperiodicity of AIC. Then several novel stabilization criteria are given for ‘small’ time delay and ‘large’ time delay, respectively, where the scale of ‘small’ or ‘large’ time delay is measured by the average control interval instead of the lower bound of all control intervals. For the case of ‘small’ time delay, it does not require the upper bound of ‘small’ time delay to be less than the lower bound of control widths. For the case of ‘small’ time delay, it does not require the upper bound of ‘small’ time delay to be less than the lower bound of control widths. Actually, this paper can be seen as an extension of recent paper [46] from the single system to the coupling networks.

Preliminaries and model descriptions
In this paper, let ℝ=(−∞,∞), ℝ+=[0,∞), ℕ={0,1,⋯}, 𝕊={1,⋯,𝑆} and 𝕃={1,⋯,𝐿}. Denote by (Ω,,{𝑡}𝑡≥0,ℙ) a complete probability space with a filtration {𝑡}𝑡≥0 satisfying the usual conditions. Let W(t) be a one-dimensional Brownian motion on the aforesaid probability space. Let r(t) be a right-continuous Markov chain on (Ω,,{𝑡}𝑡≥0,ℙ) and take values in 𝕊 with generator Γ=(𝛾𝑘ℎ)𝑆×𝑆 satisfying 𝛾𝑘ℎ≥0 for 𝑘≠ℎ and 𝛾𝑘𝑘=−∑ℎ≠𝑘𝛾𝑘ℎ. Suppose that r(t) is independent of W(t). Let 𝐿2𝑡([−𝜏,0];ℝ𝑛) be the family of all 𝑡-measurable ([−𝜏,0];ℝ𝑛)-valued random variables 𝜙={𝜙(𝑠):−𝜏≤𝑠≤0} such that 𝔼‖𝜙‖2=sup−𝜏≤𝑠≤0𝔼|𝜙(𝑠)|2<∞, where 𝔼{⋅} is the mathematical expectation of ℙ.

Consider the following stochastic delayed network with Markovian switching:

⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪d𝑥𝑙(𝑡)=𝑥𝑙(𝑡)=[𝑓𝑙(𝑡,𝑥𝑙(𝑡),𝑥𝑙(𝑡−𝜏(𝑡)),𝑟(𝑡))+∑𝑗=1𝐿ℎ𝑙𝑗(𝑥𝑙(𝑡),𝑥𝑗(𝑡),𝑟(𝑡))+𝑢𝑙(𝑡)]d𝑡+𝑔𝑙(𝑡,𝑥𝑙(𝑡),𝑥𝑙(𝑡−𝜏(𝑡)),𝑟(𝑡))d𝑊(𝑡),𝑡∈ℝ+,𝜙𝑙(𝜃), 𝜃∈[−𝜏,0],𝑙∈𝕃,
(1)
where 𝑥𝑙(𝑡)∈ℝ𝑛 is the state vector of the lth vertex system, 𝜏(𝑡) is the time varying delay satisfying 0≤𝜏(𝑡)≤𝜏, where 𝜏>0 is a constant, ℎ𝑙𝑗:ℝ𝑛×ℝ𝑛×𝕊→ℝ𝑛 is the coupling function representing the influence of vertex j on vertex l, 𝑢𝑙(𝑡) is the intermittent control of the following form:

𝑢𝑙(𝑡)={−𝐾𝑙𝑥𝑙(𝑡),0,𝑡∈[𝑡𝑖,𝑠𝑖),𝑡∈[𝑠𝑖,𝑡𝑖+1),𝑖∈ℕ,
(2)
where 0=𝑡0<𝑠0<𝑡1<𝑠1<⋯, lim𝑖→∞𝑡𝑖=∞, lim𝑖→∞𝑠𝑖=∞, 𝐾𝑙>0 (𝑙∈𝕃) are the given control gains. Functions 𝑓𝑙,𝑔𝑙:ℝ+×ℝ𝑛×ℝ𝑛×𝕊→ℝ𝑛 and ℎ𝑙𝑗 are assumed to satisfy local Lipschitz and linear growth conditions with 𝑓𝑙(𝑡,0,0,𝑘)≡0, 𝑔𝑙(𝑡,0,0,𝑘)≡0, ℎ𝑙𝑗(0,0,𝑘)≡0, ∀𝑘∈𝕊, 𝑡∈ℝ+, 𝜙=(𝜙T1,⋯,𝜙T𝑙)T∈𝐿20([−𝜏,0];ℝ𝑛𝐿) is the initial value. Let 𝑟(𝑡)=𝑟0∈𝕊 for 𝑡∈[−𝜏,0]. Therefore, for any initial value 𝜙∈𝐿20([−𝜏,0];ℝ𝑛𝐿) and 𝑟0∈𝕊, system (1) admits a unique global solution 𝑥(𝑡)=𝑥(𝑡;0,𝜙). Moreover, one can see that system (1) admits a trivial solution 𝑥(𝑡)=0, 𝑡∈ℝ+, with 𝜙(𝑡)≡0, 𝑡∈[−𝜏,0].

Remark 1
It should be noted that in model (1), we just consider the multiplicative noise. Actually, many practical phenomena in real world are observed in the presence of multiplicative noise (see [4, 35, 36] for example). In the following analysis, we consider the noise as a role of destabilizing factor (noise disturbance). In [20], Li et al. consider the stabilization of systems by intermittent multiplicative noise.

Before giving the main results, we provide the following definitions and lemmas.

Definition 1
The trivial solution of system (1) is said to be exponentially stable in mean square, if there are two positive constants M and 𝛾 such that for any initial values 𝜙∈𝐿20([−𝜏,0];ℝ𝑛𝐿) and 𝑟0∈𝕊, it holds that

𝔼|𝑥(𝑡)|2≤𝑀𝔼‖𝜙‖2exp{−𝛾𝑡}, 𝑡∈ℝ+.
In the following, we provide the concepts of average control ratio and average control period to specify the intermittent controls. The two concepts are possible to capture many different types of intermittent controls, including PIC studied in [2, 31], AIC studied [24, 26,27,28, 52]. For any 𝑡>𝑠≥0, let 𝐿̃ (𝑡,𝑠) stand for the total control interval length of intermittent control (2) and 𝑁̃ (𝑡,𝑠) be the number of control intervals [𝑡𝑖,𝑠𝑖) on [s, t), respectively.

Definition 2
[47] Intermittent control (2) is said to have an average control ratio 𝜃∈(0,1), if there is 𝐿̃ 0≥0 such that

𝐿̃ (𝑡,𝑠)≥𝜃(𝑡−𝑠)−𝐿̃ 0,  ∀𝑡>𝑠≥0.
(3)
Let 𝐿̃ 𝑐(𝑡,𝑠) denote the total rest interval length on [s, t). Then we can easily get from (3) that

𝐿̃ 𝑐(𝑡,𝑠)≤(1−𝜃)(𝑡−𝑠)+𝐿̃ 0, ∀𝑡>𝑠≥0.
Definition 3
Intermittent control (2) is said to have an average control period 𝜔>0 if there is 𝑁̃ 0≥0 such that

𝑁̃ (𝑡,𝑠)≤𝑡−𝑠𝜔+𝑁̃ 0,  ∀𝑡>𝑠≥0.
Remark 2
Actually, the definitions of average control ratio and average control period are parallel to the average time-ratio constraint and the average dwell-time constraint for the switched systems [22, 33] because intermittently controlled systems can be seen as special switched systems with switching between stable and unstable modes. The similar definitions were also given in [38, 51] for control failure, in [5, 6, 25] for DoS duration and DoS frequency of control under DoS attacks. In addition, in recent papers [13, 15, 46, 54], the definitions of average control ratio and average control period have been used in the study of systems under AIC.

Remark 3
During the past few years, many researchers have devoted themselves to investigating the stabilization or synchronization of various networks via AIC. Although the previous works focused on the aperiodicity of intermittent control, they required AIC to satisfy the quasi-periodicity condition or the minimum control ratio condition, i.e.,

(i) (quasi-periodicity condition [3, 19, 27, 45, 49]) inf𝑖∈ℕ(𝑠𝑖−𝑡𝑖)=𝜗, sup𝑖∈ℕ(𝑡𝑖+1−𝑡𝑖)=𝜛, where 0<𝜗<𝜛<∞;

(ii) (minimum control ratio condition [11, 27, 44, 45, 53]) 𝜓=limsup𝑖→∞𝑡𝑖+1−𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖+1−𝑡𝑖∈(0,1).

In fact, conditions (i) and (ii) are related to the so-called fixed dwell-time condition for switched systems. From this point of view, one can see that Definitions 2 and 3 are suitable for wider intermittent control inputs.

In what follows, we provide four special intermittent controls to show the generality of Definitions 2 and 3

(i)
Consider the PIC with control activation intervals as

∪𝑖=0∞[𝑖𝐶1,𝑖𝐶1+𝐶0),
(4)
where 𝐶1>0 stands for the period of the PIC, 𝐶0>0 is the control width. Obviously, 𝐶0<𝐶1. By simple calculations, we can obtain 𝐿̃ (𝑡,𝑠)≥𝐶0𝐶1(𝑡−𝑠)−𝐶0𝐶1(𝐶1−𝐶0) and 𝑁̃ (𝑡,𝑠)≤𝑡−𝑠𝐶1+𝐶1−𝐶0𝐶1, ∀𝑡>𝑠≥0, which means that the PIC with control intervals as (4) satisfies average control ratio 𝜃=𝐶0𝐶1 with 𝐿̃ 0=𝐶0𝐶1(𝐶1−𝐶0) and average control period with 𝑁̃ 0=𝐶1−𝐶0𝐶1. This demonstrates that PIC can be seen as a special case of AIC in this paper.

(ii)
Consider an AIC with control activation intervals as ∪∞𝑖=0[𝑡𝑖,𝑠𝑖) satisfying 𝑡0=0 and

inf𝑖∈ℕ{𝑠𝑖−𝑡𝑖}=𝜗>0,sup𝑖∈ℕ{𝑡𝑖+1−𝑡𝑖}=𝜛<∞,
(5)
where 𝜗 is called the minimum control width, and 𝜛 is called the maximum activation period. Condition (5) for AIC can be seen as a quasi-periodicity condition, which has been widely used in previous literature such as [3, 19, 27, 45, 49]. One can see that in this situation, it holds that 𝐿̃ (𝑡,𝑠)≥𝜗𝜛(𝑡−𝑠)−𝜗𝜛(𝜛−𝜗), ∀𝑡>𝑠≥0. If we further assume that inf𝑖∈ℕ{𝑡𝑖+1−𝑡𝑖}=𝜛̃ , then 𝑁̃ (𝑡,𝑠)≤𝑡−𝑠𝜛̃ +𝜛−𝜗𝜛̃ , ∀𝑡>𝑠≥0. In this ragard, AIC satisfying (5) admits average control ratio 𝜃=𝜗𝜛 with 𝐿̃ 0=𝜗𝜛(𝜛−𝜗) and average control period 𝜔=𝜛̃  with 𝑁̃ 0=𝜛−𝜗𝜛̃ . It should be stressed here that for the specified AIC satisfies (5), one can actually measure a larger value for the average control ratio than 𝜗𝜛 (see case (iv) in the following).

(iii)
Consider an AIC with control activation intervals as ∪∞𝑖=0[𝑡𝑖,𝑠𝑖) satisfying 𝑡0=0 and

limsup𝑖→∞𝑡𝑖+1−𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖+1−𝑡𝑖≤𝜓,
(6)
where 𝜓∈(0,1). The physical meaning of 𝜓∈(0,1) is the maximum proportion of control rest width 𝑡𝑖+1−𝑠𝑖 over 𝑡𝑖+1−𝑡𝑖 (see [27]). We here call 1−𝜓 the minimum activation time ratio. This kind of restriction is imposed in [11, 27, 44, 45, 53] to characterize the AIC. It is easy to see that 𝐿̃ (𝑡,𝑠)≥(1−𝜓)(𝑡−𝑠)−𝐿̃ 0, ∀𝑡>𝑠≥0, where 𝐿̃ 0≥max{0,max𝑘{(1−𝜓)𝑇𝑘−∑𝑘−1𝑗=0(𝑆𝑗−𝑇𝑗)}}. Therefore, AIC satisfying (6) admits average control ratio 𝜃=1−𝜓. It should be emphasized here that for the specified AIC satisfies (6), one can actually measure a larger value for the average control ratio than 1−𝜓 (see case (iv) in the following).

(iv)
Consider an extreme AIC with control activation intervals as

∪𝑖=0∞([𝑖,𝑖+0.01)∪[𝑖+0.55,𝑖+0.99)).
(7)
Then we can obtain

𝐿̃ (𝑡,𝑠)≥0.45(𝑡−𝑠)−0.4455,𝑁̃ (𝑡,𝑠)≤𝑡−𝑠0.5+0.8, ∀𝑡>𝑠≥0.
Therefore, the AIC with control activation intervals (7) admits average control ratio 𝜃=0.45 and average control period 𝜔=0.5. It is worth noting that although AIC with control intervals as (7) satisfies (5) (in this regard, 𝜗=0.01, 𝜛=0.55 and AATR 𝜃=1/55) and (6) (in this regard, 𝜓=54/55 and AATR 𝜃=1/55), it will be more conservative for stabilization conditions. For detailed discussions, please refer to Remark 5 in this paper.

Before ending this section, two useful lemmas are provided.

Lemma 1
[16] Let 𝑧:[𝑡̂ −𝜏,∞)→ℝ+ be a continuous function such that 𝑧˙(𝑡)≤−𝜆𝑧(𝑡)+𝜖‖𝑧𝑡‖ holds for all 𝑡≥𝑡̂ , where ‖𝑧𝑡‖=sup𝑡−𝜏≤𝑠≤𝑡𝑧(𝑠). If 𝜆>𝜖>0, then 𝑧(𝑡)≤‖𝑧𝑡̂ ‖exp{−𝜌(𝑡−𝑡̂ )}, 𝑡≥𝑡̂ , where 𝜌>0 is the smallest real root of equation 𝜆−𝜌−𝜖e𝜌𝜏=0.

Lemma 2
[23] Let 𝑧:[𝑡̂ −𝜏,∞)→ℝ+ be a continuous function such that 𝑧˙(𝑡)≤𝜗𝑧(𝑡)+𝜖‖𝑧𝑡‖ holds for all 𝑡≥𝑡̂ , where ‖𝑧𝑡‖=sup𝑡−𝜏≤𝑠≤𝑡𝑧(𝑠). If 𝜗>0, 𝜖>0, then 𝑧(𝑡)≤‖𝑧𝑡̂ ‖exp{(𝜗+𝜖)(𝑡−𝑡̂ )}, 𝑡≥𝑡̂ .

Main results
This section aims to develop two kinds of stabilization criteria for system (1) via AIC: the case of ‘small’ time delay and the case of large time delay. The index for the ‘small’ time delay and ‘large’ time delay is measured by the average control length 𝜃𝜔, i.e., if the upper bound of delay must be less than 𝜃𝜔, we call it ‘small’ time delay, and if the upper bound of delay can be larger than 𝜃𝜔, we call it ‘large’ time delay. First, we study the case of ‘small’ time delay.

Theorem 1
Suppose that there are functions 𝑉𝑙(𝑥𝑙,𝑡,𝑘)∈𝐶2,1(ℝ𝑛×ℝ+×𝕊;ℝ+), positive constants 𝛼𝑙, 𝛽𝑙, 𝜆1𝑙, 𝜆2𝑙, 𝜆3𝑙, nonnegative constants 𝑎𝑙𝑗 and functions 𝐹𝑙𝑗:ℝ𝑛×ℝ𝑛→ℝ such that

A1
𝛼𝑙|𝑥𝑙|2≤𝑉𝑙(𝑥𝑙,𝑡,𝑘)≤𝛽𝑙|𝑥𝑙|2, ∀𝑡∈ℝ+, 𝑘∈𝕊.

A2
𝑉𝑙(𝑥𝑙,𝑦𝑙,𝑡,𝑘)≤Λ𝑙(𝑡)𝑉𝑙(𝑥𝑙,𝑡,𝑘)+𝜆2𝑙minℎ∈𝕊{𝑉𝑙(𝑦𝑙,𝑡−𝜏(𝑡),ℎ)}+∑𝐿𝑗=1𝑎𝑙𝑗𝐹𝑙𝑗(𝑥𝑙,𝑥𝑗), where Λ𝑙(𝑡)=−𝜆1𝑙 for 𝑡∈[𝑡𝑖,𝑠𝑖) and Λ𝑙(𝑡)=𝜆3𝑙 for 𝑡∈[𝑠𝑖,𝑡𝑖+1).

A3
Digraph (,(𝑎𝑙𝑗)𝐿×𝐿) is strongly connected and along each directed cycle  of (,(𝑎𝑙𝑗)𝐿×𝐿), there is

∑(𝑙,𝑗)∈()𝐹𝑗𝑙(𝑥𝑗,𝑥𝑙)≤0,
for all 𝑥𝑗,𝑥𝑙∈ℝ𝑛.

If AIC (2) admits average control ratio 𝜃∈(0,1) and average control period 𝜔 such that

(𝜌+𝜆2+𝜆3)𝜃>𝜆2+𝜆3+𝜌𝜏𝜔,
(8)
where 𝜆1=min𝑙∈𝕃{𝜆1𝑙}, 𝜆2=max𝑙∈𝕃{𝜆2𝑙}, 𝜆3=max𝑙∈𝕃{𝜆3𝑙} and 𝜌 is the unique positive solution of 𝜌−𝜆1+𝜆2e𝜌𝜏=0, then the trivial solution of system (1) is exponentially stable in mean square.

Proof
Let 𝑐𝑙, 𝑙∈𝕃, be the cofactor of the lth diagonal element of the Laplacian matrix of (𝑎𝑙𝑗)𝐿×𝐿. Since digraph (,(𝑎𝑙𝑗)𝐿×𝐿) is strongly connected, from Theorem 2.2 in [18], we have 𝑐𝑙>0, 𝑙∈𝕃. Construct

𝑉(𝑥,𝑡,𝑘)=∑𝑙=1𝐿𝑐𝑙𝑉𝑙(𝑥𝑙,𝑡,𝑘).
(9)
It leads to

𝛼|𝑥|2≤𝑉(𝑥,𝑡,𝑘)≤𝛽|𝑥|2,
(10)
where 𝛼=min𝑙∈𝕃{𝑐𝑙𝛼𝑙} and 𝛽=max𝑙∈𝕃{𝑐𝑙𝛽𝑙}.

For 𝑡∈[𝑡𝑖,𝑠𝑖), by means of condition A2 and (9), it follows

𝑉(𝑥,𝑦,𝑡,𝑘)=∑𝑙=1𝐿𝑐𝑙𝑉𝑙(𝑥𝑙,𝑦𝑙,𝑡,𝑘)≤−∑𝑙=1𝐿𝜆1𝑙𝑐𝑙𝑉𝑙(𝑥𝑙,𝑡,𝑘)+∑𝑙=1𝐿𝜆2𝑙𝑐𝑙minℎ∈𝕊{𝑉𝑙(𝑦𝑙,𝑡−𝜏(𝑡),ℎ)}+∑𝑙=1𝐿∑𝑗=1𝐿𝑎𝑙𝑗𝐹𝑙𝑗(𝑥𝑙,𝑥𝑗)≤−𝜆1𝑉(𝑥,𝑡,𝑘)+𝜆2∑𝑙=1𝐿minℎ∈𝕊{𝑐𝑙𝑉𝑙(𝑦𝑙,𝑡−𝜏(𝑡),ℎ)}+∑𝑙=1𝐿∑𝑗=1𝐿𝑎𝑙𝑗𝐹𝑙𝑗(𝑥𝑙,𝑥𝑗)≤−𝜆1𝑉(𝑥,𝑡,𝑘)+𝜆2minℎ∈𝕊{𝑉(𝑦,𝑡−𝜏(𝑡),ℎ)}+∑𝑙=1𝐿∑𝑗=1𝐿𝑎𝑙𝑗𝐹𝑙𝑗(𝑥𝑙,𝑥𝑗).
(11)
By using Theorem 2.2 in [18] and condition A3, we have

∑𝑙=1𝐿∑𝑗=1𝐿𝑎𝑙𝑗𝐹𝑙𝑗(𝑡,𝑥𝑙,𝑦𝑗,𝑘)=0.
(12)
Substituting (12) into (11) yields

𝑉(𝑥,𝑦,𝑡,𝑘)≤−𝜆1𝑉(𝑥,𝑡,𝑘)+𝜆2minℎ∈𝕊{𝑉(𝑦,𝑡−𝜏(𝑡),ℎ)},𝑡∈[𝑡𝑖,𝑠𝑖).
(13)
Similarly, we can get

𝑉(𝑥,𝑦,𝑡,𝑘)≤𝜆3𝑉(𝑥,𝑡,𝑘)+𝜆2minℎ∈𝕊{𝑉(𝑦,𝑡−𝜏(𝑡),ℎ)},𝑡∈[𝑠𝑖,𝑡𝑖+1).
(14)
For simplicity, let 𝑈(𝑡)=𝔼𝑉(𝑥(𝑡),𝑡,𝑟(𝑡)), 𝑡∈ℝ+. From [17], it can be checked that U(t) is continuous for all 𝑡∈ℝ+. For 𝑡∈[0,𝑠0) and sufficiently small Δ𝑡>0 such that 𝑡+Δ𝑡∈[0,𝑠0), applying the generalized Itô’s formula (see [30]), it yields

𝑈(𝑡+Δ𝑡)=𝑈(𝑡)+∫𝑡+Δ𝑡𝑡𝔼𝑉(𝑥(𝑠),𝑥(𝑠−𝜏(𝑠)),𝑠,𝑟(𝑠))d𝑠.
Then, by (13), it is easy to see that

=𝐷+𝑈(𝑡)𝔼𝑉(𝑥(𝑡),𝑥(𝑡−𝜏(𝑡)),𝑡,𝑟(𝑡))≤−𝜆1𝑈(𝑡)+𝜆2minℎ∈𝕊{𝔼𝑉(𝑥(𝑡−𝜏(𝑡)),𝑡−𝜏(𝑡),ℎ)}≤−𝜆1𝑈(𝑡)+𝜆2𝑈(𝑡−𝜏(𝑡)), 𝑡∈[0,𝑠0).
Applying Lemma 1, we have

𝑈(𝑡)≤sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝜎)exp{−𝜌𝑡},  𝑡∈[0,𝑠0).
If 𝑠0−𝜏≥0, one can obviously see that sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝑠0+𝜎)≤sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝜎)×exp{−𝜌𝑠0+𝜌𝜏}. If 𝑠0−𝜏<0, then

sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝑠0+𝜎)≤sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝜎)≤sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝜎)exp{−𝜌𝑠0+𝜌𝜏}.
Thus, it can be always obtained

sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝑠0+𝜎)≤sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝜎)exp{−𝜌𝑠0+𝜌𝜏}.
(15)
For 𝑡∈[𝑠0,𝑡1), by using (14), it yields

D+𝑈(𝑡)≤𝜆3𝑈(𝑡)+𝜆2𝑈(𝑡−𝜏(𝑡)).
(16)
Then we can easily derive from (15), (16) and Lemma 2 that

𝑈(𝑡)≤sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝑠0+𝜎)exp{(𝜆2+𝜆3)(𝑡−𝑠0)}≤sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝜎)exp{(𝜆2+𝜆3)(𝑡−𝑠0)−𝜌𝑠0+𝜌𝜏},𝑡∈[𝑠0,𝑡1).
Therefore,

≤sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝑡1+𝜎)sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝜎)exp{(𝜆2+𝜆3)(𝑡1−𝑠0)−𝜌𝑠0+𝜌𝜏}.
(17)
For 𝑡∈[𝑡1,𝑠1), by Lemma 1 and (17), it can be obtained that

𝑈(𝑡)≤≤sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝑡1+𝜎)exp{−𝜌(𝑡−𝑡1)}sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝜎)exp{(𝜆2+𝜆3)(𝑡1−𝑠0)−𝜌(𝑡−𝑡1+𝑠0)+𝜌𝜏}.
If 𝑠1−𝜏≥𝑡1 or 𝑠1−𝜏≤0, one can easily check that

≤sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝑠1+𝜎)sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝜎)exp{(𝜆2+𝜆3)(𝑡1−𝑠0)−𝜌(𝑠1−𝑡1+𝑠0)+2𝜌𝜏}.
If 𝑠0≤𝑠1−𝜏<𝑡1, then

≤sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝑠1+𝜎)≤𝑈(𝑡1)sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝜎)exp{(𝜆2+𝜆3)(𝑡1−𝑠0)−𝜌(𝑠0+𝑠1−𝑡1)+2𝜌𝜏}.
If 𝑠1−𝜏<𝑠0, then

≤≤≤sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝑠1+𝜎)max{𝑈(𝑡1),𝑈(𝑠0−(𝜏−(𝑠1−𝑠0)))}max{𝑈(𝑡1),sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝜎)exp{−𝜌(𝑠0+𝑠1−𝑡1)}}sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝜎)exp{(𝜆2+𝜆3)(𝑡1−𝑠0)−𝜌(𝑠0+𝑠1−𝑡1)+2𝜌𝜏}.
Thus, we always have

≤sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝑠1+𝜎)sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝜎)exp{(𝜆2+𝜆3)(𝑡1−𝑠0)−𝜌(𝑠1−𝑡1+𝑠0)+2𝜌𝜏}.
(18)
For 𝑡∈[𝑠1,𝑡2), it follows from Lemma 2 and (18) that

𝑈(𝑡)≤≤sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝑠1+𝜎)exp{(𝜆2+𝜆3)(𝑡−𝑠1)}sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝜎)exp{(𝜆2+𝜆3)(𝑡−𝑠1+𝑡1−𝑠0)−𝜌(𝑠1−𝑡1+𝑠0)+2𝜌𝜏}
and

≤sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝑡2+𝜎)sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝜎)exp{(𝜆2+𝜆3)(𝑡2−𝑠1+𝑡1−𝑠0)−𝜌(𝑠1−𝑡1+𝑠0)+2𝜌𝜏}.
Repeating above procedures, we can arrive at that for any 𝑡∈[𝑡𝑖,𝑡𝑖+1), 𝑖∈ℕ,

𝑈(𝑡)≤=sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝜎)exp{(𝜆2+𝜆3)(𝑡1−𝑠0+𝑡2−𝑠1+⋯+𝑡𝑖−𝑠𝑖−1)−𝜌(𝑠0+𝑠1−𝑡1+⋯+𝑠𝑖−1−𝑡𝑖−1+𝑡−𝑡𝑖)+𝑖𝜌𝜏}sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝜎)exp{(𝜆2+𝜆3)𝐿̃ 𝑐(𝑡,0)−𝜌𝐿̃ (𝑡,0)+𝑁̃ (𝑡,0)𝜌𝜏}, 𝑡∈[𝑡𝑖,𝑠𝑖),
(19)
and

𝑈(𝑡)≤=sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝜎)exp{(𝜆2+𝜆3)(𝑡1−𝑠0+𝑡2−𝑠1+⋯+𝑡𝑖−𝑠𝑖−1+𝑡−𝑠𝑖)−𝜌(𝑠0+𝑠1−𝑡1+⋯+𝑠𝑖−𝑡𝑖)+(𝑖+1)𝜌𝜏}sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝜎)exp{(𝜆2+𝜆3)𝐿̃ 𝑐(𝑡,0)−𝜌𝐿̃ (𝑡,0)+𝑁̃ (𝑡,0)𝜌𝜏},𝑡∈[𝑠𝑖,𝑡𝑖+1).
(20)
According to Definitions 2 and 3, it can be checked from (19) and (20) that

𝑈(𝑡)≤≤=sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝜎)exp{(𝜆2+𝜆3)𝐿̃ 𝑐(𝑡,0)−𝜌𝐿̃ (𝑡,0)+𝑁̃ (𝑡,0)𝜌𝜏}sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝜎)exp{(𝜆2+𝜆3)(1−𝜃)𝑡+(𝜆2+𝜆3)𝐿̃ 0−𝜌𝜃𝑡+𝜌𝐿̃ 0+𝜌𝜏𝜔𝑡+𝑁̃ 0𝜌𝜏}𝑀sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑈(𝜎)exp{−[𝜌𝜃−(𝜆2+𝜆3)(1−𝜃)−𝜌𝜏𝜔]𝑡}, 𝑡∈ℝ+,
where 𝑀=exp{(𝜆2+𝜆3)𝐿̃ 0+𝜌𝐿̃ 0+𝑁̃ 0𝜌𝜏}>0. From (10), one has

𝔼|𝑥(𝑡)|2≤𝛽𝛼𝑀𝔼‖𝜙‖2×exp{−[𝜌𝜃−(𝜆2+𝜆3)(1−𝜃)−𝜌𝜏𝜔]𝑡}, 𝑡∈ℝ+.
Making use of (8), we see that 𝜌𝜃−(𝜆2+𝜆3)(1−𝜃)−𝜌𝜏𝜔>0. Hence, the trivial solution of system (1) is exponentially stable in mean square, which completes the proof. ◻

Remark 4
Recently, in [3, 19, 27, 45, 49], the stabilization and synchronization of delayed networks were studied via AIC, where the upper bound of time delay should be less than inf𝑖∈ℕ(𝑠𝑖−𝑡𝑖). In Theorem 1, we relax this restriction by rendering the upper bound of time delay be less than the average control interval, i.e., 𝜏<𝜃𝜔, which can be easily obtained from condition (8). But the upper bound of time delay can be larger than inf𝑖∈ℕ(𝑠𝑖−𝑡𝑖). Thus, the conditions of Theorem 1 are less restrictive than the results in [3, 19, 27, 45, 49] and has wider applications.

Remark 5
In previous works [3, 19, 27, 45, 49], the authors imposed the restriction of inf𝑖∈ℕ(𝑠𝑖−𝑡𝑖)=𝜗, sup𝑖∈ℕ(𝑡𝑖+1−𝑡𝑖)=𝜛. In this regard, condition (8) in Theorem 1 will become (𝜌+𝜆2+𝜆3)𝜃>𝜆2+𝜆3+𝜌𝜏𝜔. It is clear that our condition is less restrictive. We take a simple example in the following to show this statement. Let the control intervals of a intermittent control as follows:

∪∞𝑖=0([2𝑖,2𝑖+0.1)∪[2𝑖+0.8,2𝑖+1.9)).
(21)
Then we can easily get the average control ratio 𝜃=0.6 and the average control period 𝜔=1. However, inf𝑖∈ℕ(𝑠𝑖−𝑡𝑖)=0.1, sup𝑖∈ℕ(𝑡𝑖+1−𝑡𝑖)=1.2. Hence, condition (8) in Theorem 1 means that 0.6(𝜌+𝜆2+𝜆3)>𝜆2+𝜆3+𝜌𝜏, while the previous works in [3, 19, 27, 45, 49] required that 0.1(𝜌+𝜆2+𝜆3)>𝜆2+𝜆3+𝜌𝜏1.2, which illustrates the less restrictiveness of our condition.

In the sequel, we are going to discuss the case of ‘large’ time delay, i.e., upper bound of delay can be larger than 𝜃𝜔.

Theorem 2
Suppose that there are functions 𝑉𝑙(𝑥𝑙,𝑡,𝑘)∈𝐶2,1(ℝ𝑛×ℝ+×𝕊;ℝ+), positive constants 𝛼𝑙, 𝛽𝑙, 𝜆1𝑙, 𝜆2𝑙, 𝜆3𝑙, nonnegative constants 𝑎𝑙𝑗 and functions 𝐹𝑙𝑗:ℝ𝑛×ℝ𝑛→ℝ such that conditions A1–A3 in Theorem 1hold. If AIC (2) admits an average control ratio 𝜃∈(0,1) satisfying

𝜌>(𝜆1+𝜆3)(1−𝜃),
(22)
where 𝜆1, 𝜆2, 𝜆3 and 𝜌 are the same as those in Theorem 1, then the trivial solution of system (1) is exponentially stable in mean square.

Proof
Similar to the proof of Theorem 1, we construct V(x, t, k) as (9). Then we can get (10) and

𝐷+𝔼𝑉(𝑥(𝑡),𝑡,𝑟(𝑡))≤−𝜆1𝔼𝑉(𝑥(𝑡),𝑡,𝑟(𝑡))+𝜆2sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝔼𝑉(𝑥(𝑡+𝜎),𝑡+𝜎,𝑟(𝑡+𝜎)),𝑡∈[𝑡𝑖,𝑠𝑖),
(23)
𝐷+𝔼𝑉(𝑥(𝑡),𝑡,𝑟(𝑡))≤𝜆3𝔼𝑉(𝑥(𝑡),𝑡,𝑟(𝑡))+𝜆2sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝔼𝑉(𝑥(𝑡+𝜎),𝑡+𝜎,𝑟(𝑡+𝜎)),𝑡∈[𝑠𝑖,𝑡𝑖+1).
(24)
Define 𝑀0=sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝔼𝑉(𝑥(𝜎),𝜎,𝑟(𝜎)) and 𝑀(𝑡)=𝔼𝑉(𝑥(𝑡),𝑡,𝑟(𝑡))exp{𝜌𝑡}, 𝑡∈ℝ+. Then it is easy to see from Lemma 3.1 in [17] that M(t) is continuous. Also, we can obtain from Lemma 1 that

𝑀(𝑡)≤𝑀0,  𝑡∈[0,𝑠0).
(25)
Then we claim that

𝑀(𝑡)≤𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)(𝑡−𝑠0)},  𝑡∈[𝑠0,𝑡1).
(26)
If (26) is false, then there must exist 𝑡∗∈[𝑠0,𝑡1) such that

𝑀(𝑡∗)=𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)(𝑡∗−𝑠0)},𝐷+𝑀(𝑡)∣∣𝑡=𝑡∗>(𝜆1+𝜆3)𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)(𝑡∗−𝑠0)},𝑀(𝑡)≤𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)(𝑡−𝑠0)},  𝑡∈[𝑠0,𝑡∗).
(27)
For 𝜏(𝑡∗)≥0, if 𝑠0<𝑡∗−𝜏(𝑡∗)≤𝑡∗, the third inequality of (27) implies

𝑀(𝑡∗−𝜏(𝑡∗))<≤𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)(𝑡∗−𝜏(𝑡∗)−𝑠0)}𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)(𝑡∗−𝑠0)}.
If −𝜏≤𝑡∗−𝜏(𝑡∗)≤𝑠0, it is clear that

𝑀(𝑡∗−𝜏(𝑡∗))≤𝑀0≤𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)(𝑡∗−𝑠0)}.
Hence,

sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑀(𝑡∗+𝜎)≤𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)(𝑡∗−𝑠0)}.
(28)
Combining (24), (28), the first and the third inequalities of (27), it can be obtained that

=𝐷+𝑀(𝑡)∣∣𝑡=𝑡∗−(𝜆1+𝜆3)𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)(𝑡∗−𝑠0)}≤(𝜌+𝜆3)𝑀(𝑡∗)−(𝜆1+𝜆3)𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)(𝑡∗−𝑠0)}+𝜆2exp{𝜌𝑡∗}sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝔼𝑉(𝑥(𝑡+𝜎),𝑡+𝜎,𝑟(𝑡+𝜎))≤(𝜌+𝜆3)𝑀(𝑡∗)+𝜆2e𝜌𝜏sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑀(𝑡+𝜎)−(𝜆1+𝜆3)𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)(𝑡∗−𝑠0)}≤(𝜌+𝜆2e𝜌𝜏−𝜆1)𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)(𝑡∗−𝑠0)}0,
(29)
which contradicts the second inequality of (27). Thus, (26) is fulfilled. What’s more, in light of (25), (26) and the definition of 𝑀0, one can easily get

𝑀(𝑡)≤𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)(𝑡1−𝑠0)},  𝑡∈[0−𝜏,𝑡1).
(30)
In the following, we prove that

𝑀(𝑡)≤𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)(𝑡1−𝑠0)},  𝑡∈[𝑡1,𝑠1).
(31)
If (31) fails to hold, then there must exist a 𝑡̃ ∈[𝑡1,𝑠1) such that

𝑀(𝑡̃ )=𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)(𝑡1−𝑠0)},𝐷+𝑀(𝑡)∣∣𝑡=𝑡̃ >0,𝑀(𝑡)≤𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)(𝑡1−𝑠0)},𝑡∈[𝑡1,𝑡̃ ).
(32)
Combining (30) and the third inequality of (32), it yields

𝑀(𝑡)≤𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)(𝑡1−𝑠0)},  𝑡∈[−𝜏,𝑡̃ ),
which together with 𝑀(𝑡̃ )=𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)(𝑡1−𝑠0)} means that

≤≤=𝐷+𝑀(𝑡)∣∣𝑡=𝑡̃ =(𝜌−𝜆1)𝑀(𝑡̃ )+𝜆2exp{𝜌(𝑡̃ −𝑡0)}×sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0{exp{−𝜌(𝑡̃ +𝜎)+𝜌(𝑡̃ +𝜎)}𝔼𝑉(𝑡̃ +𝜎)}(𝜌−𝜆1)𝑀(𝑡̃ )+𝜆2e𝜌(𝑡̃ −𝑡0)e−𝜌(𝑡̃ −𝜏−𝑡0)sup−𝜏≤𝜎≤0𝑀(𝑡̃ +𝜎)(𝜌−𝜆1+𝜆2e𝜌𝜏)𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)(𝑡1−𝑠0)}0.
This is a contradiction to the second inequality of (32). Therefore, (31) holds. With the same approach, we can easily prove that

𝑀(𝑡)≤𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)(𝑡1−𝑠0+𝑡−𝑠1)},  𝑡∈[𝑠1,𝑡2).
For any 𝑡≥𝑡0, there exists an 𝑖∗∈ℕ such that 𝑡∈[𝑡𝑖∗,𝑡𝑖∗+1). Based on the inductive method, it can be checked that

𝑀(𝑡)≤=𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)∑𝑗=1𝑖∗(𝑡𝑗−𝑠𝑗−1)}𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)𝐿̃ 𝑐(𝑡,0)}, 𝑡∈[𝑡𝑖∗,𝑠𝑖∗),
and

𝑀(𝑡)≤=𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)(∑𝑗=1𝑖∗(𝑡𝑗−𝑠𝑗−1)+𝑡−𝑠𝑖∗)}𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)𝐿̃ 𝑐(𝑡,0)}, 𝑡∈[𝑠𝑖∗,𝑡𝑖∗+1).
Thus, considering the definition of 𝐿𝑐(𝑡,0), it is straightforward to show that for 𝑡∈ℝ+,

𝑀(𝑡)≤≤𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)𝐿̃ 𝑐(𝑡,0)}𝑀0exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)𝐿̃ 0}exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)(1−𝜃)𝑡},
which implies that

≤𝔼𝑉(𝑥(𝑡),𝑡,𝑟(𝑡))sup𝑡0−𝜏≤𝜎≤𝑡0𝔼𝑉(𝑥(𝜎),𝜎,𝑟(𝜎))exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)𝐿̃ 0}×exp{−[𝜌−(𝜆1+𝜆3)(1−𝜃)]𝑡}, 𝑡∈ℝ+.
In consideration of (10), it is not difficult to see that

𝔼|𝑥(𝑡)|2≤𝑀¯0𝔼‖𝜙‖2exp{−[𝜌−(𝜆1+𝜆3)(1−𝜃)]𝑡}, 𝑡∈ℝ+,
where 𝑀¯0=𝛽𝛼exp{(𝜆1+𝜆3)𝐿̃ 0}>0. With the use of condition (22), we know 𝜌−(𝜆1+𝜆3)(1−𝜃)>0, which shows that the trivial solution of system (1) is exponentially stable in mean square. This completes the proof. ◻

Remark 6
In Theorem 2, the restriction imposed on the upper bound of time delay and the lower bound of control widths is removed. Moreover, compared with Theorem 1, the control period or average control period can be an arbitrary value in Theorem 2. And the only restriction imposed on the AIC is the average control ratio and the control gain.

Remark 7
In previous works [11, 27, 44, 45, 53], the authors imposed the following minimum control ratio condition:

Ψ=limsup𝑖→∞𝑡𝑖+1−𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖+1−𝑡𝑖∈(0,1).
In this scenario, 1−Ψ is called the minimum control ratio. Then condition (22) in Theorem 2 will become 𝜌>(𝜆1+𝜆3)Ψ. It is clear that our condition is less restrictive. To show this point, we consider the intermittent control with control intervals as (21). Then we can easily get that 𝜃=0.6. However, limsup𝑖→∞𝑡𝑖+1−𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖+1−𝑡𝑖=78. Hence, Theorem 2 requires that 𝜌>0.4(𝜆1+𝜆3), while previous works [11, 27, 44, 45, 53] required that 𝜌>0.875(𝜆1+𝜆3), which illustrates the less restrictiveness of our condition.

Note that Theorems 1 and 2 are based on the existence of functions 𝑉𝑙(𝑥𝑙,𝑡,𝑘) that satisfy conditions A1 and A2. But it is usually difficult to directly find such function because of the nonlinearity of 𝑓𝑙, 𝑔𝑙 and ℎ𝑙𝑗. In the sequel, based on Theorems 1 and 2, an easy-to-check stabilization criterion will be given. First, we give the following assumptions.

Assumption 1
For each 𝑘∈𝕊, 𝑙∈𝕃, there exist nonnegative constants 𝜂(𝑙)𝑘, 𝜇(𝑙)𝑘, 𝜈(𝑙)𝑘, 𝑎(𝑘)𝑙𝑗 and constant 𝜉(𝑙)𝑘 such that

𝑥T𝑙𝑓𝑙(𝑡,𝑥𝑙,𝑦𝑙,𝑘)≤𝜉(𝑙)𝑘|𝑥𝑙|2+𝜂(𝑙)𝑘|𝑦𝑙|2,𝑥T𝑙ℎ𝑙𝑗(𝑥𝑙,𝑥𝑗,𝑘)≤𝑎(𝑘)𝑙𝑗(|𝑥𝑙|2+|𝑥𝑗|2),|𝑔𝑙(𝑡,𝑥𝑙,𝑦𝑙,𝑘)|2≤𝜇(𝑙)𝑘|𝑥𝑙|2+𝜈(𝑙)𝑘|𝑦𝑙|2.
Assumption 2
Digraph (,(𝑎𝑙𝑗)𝐿×𝐿) is strongly connected, where 𝑎𝑙𝑗=max𝑘∈𝕊{𝑎(𝑘)𝑙𝑗}.

Let 𝑞(𝑙)=(𝑞(𝑙)1,⋯,𝑞(𝑙)𝑆)T, where 𝑞(𝑙)𝑘>0 are to be determined. Then for simplicity, define 𝜆1𝑙=min𝑘∈𝕊{2𝐾𝑙−2𝜉(𝑙)𝑘−𝜇(𝑙)𝑘−∑𝑆ℎ=1𝛾𝑘ℎ𝑞(𝑙)ℎ𝑞(𝑙)𝑘−2∑𝐿𝑗=1𝑎(𝑘)𝑙𝑗−∑𝐿𝑗=1𝑏𝑙𝑗𝑞(𝑙)𝑘}, 𝜆2𝑙=max𝑘∈𝕊{𝑞(𝑙)𝑘𝜈(𝑙)𝑘+2𝑞(𝑙)𝑘𝜂(𝑙)𝑘minℎ∈𝕊{𝑞(𝑙)ℎ}}, 𝜆3𝑙=2𝐾𝑙−𝜆1𝑙, 𝑏𝑙𝑗=max𝑘∈𝕊{2𝑞(𝑙)𝑘𝑎𝑙𝑗}, 𝜆1=min𝑙∈𝕃{𝜆1𝑙}, 𝜆2=max𝑙∈𝕃{𝜆2𝑙}, 𝜆3=max𝑙∈𝕃{𝜆3𝑙}.

Corollary 1
Under Assumptions 1 and 2, suppose that there are 𝑞(𝑙)=(𝑞(𝑙)1,⋯,𝑞(𝑙)𝑆)T, 𝑞(𝑙)𝑘>0, 𝑙∈𝕃, such that 𝜆1>𝜆3 and one of the following inequalities holds:

(𝜌+𝜆2+𝜆3)𝜃>𝜆2+𝜆3+𝜌𝜏𝜔,
(33)
or

𝜌>(𝜆1+𝜆3)(1−𝜃),
(34)
where 𝜌>0 is the unique solution to 𝜌−𝜆1+𝜆2e𝜌𝜏=0, 𝜃∈(0,1) and 𝜔>0 are, respectively, the average control ratio and average control period of AIC (2). Then the trivial solution of system (1) is exponentially stable in mean square.

Proof
Define 𝑉𝑙(𝑥𝑙,𝑡,𝑘)=𝑞(𝑙)𝑘|𝑥𝑙|2. Obviously, condition A1 in Theorem 1 holds with 𝛼𝑙=min𝑘∈𝕊{𝑞(𝑙)𝑘} and 𝛽𝑙=max𝑘∈𝕊{𝑞(𝑙)𝑘}. For 𝑡∈[𝑡𝑖,𝑠𝑖), it can be derived from Assumption 1 that

=≤≤≤≤𝑉𝑙(𝑥,𝑦𝑙,𝑡,𝑘)2𝑞(𝑙)𝑘[𝑥T𝑓𝑙(𝑡,𝑥𝑙,𝑦𝑙,𝑘)−𝐾𝑙|𝑥𝑙|2+∑𝑗=1𝐿𝑥T𝑙ℎ𝑙𝑗(𝑥𝑙,𝑥𝑗,𝑘)]+∑ℎ=1𝑆𝛾𝑘ℎ𝑞(𝑙)ℎ|𝑥𝑙|2+𝑞(𝑙)𝑘|𝑔𝑙(𝑡,𝑥𝑙,𝑦𝑙,𝑘)|2(2𝑞(𝑙)𝑘𝜉(𝑙)𝑘−2𝑞(𝑙)𝑘𝐾𝑙+𝑞(𝑙)𝑘𝜇(𝑙)𝑘+∑ℎ=1𝑆𝛾𝑘ℎ𝑞(𝑙)ℎ+2𝑞(𝑙)𝑘∑𝑗=1𝐿𝑎(𝑘)𝑙𝑗)|𝑥𝑙|2+2𝑞(𝑙)𝑘∑𝑗=1𝐿𝑎(𝑘)𝑙𝑗|𝑥𝑗|2+(2𝑞(𝑙)𝑘𝜂(𝑙)𝑘+𝑞(𝑙)𝑘𝜈(𝑙)𝑘)|𝑦𝑙|2(2𝜉(𝑙)𝑘−2𝐾𝑙+𝜇(𝑙)𝑘+∑ℎ=1𝑆𝛾𝑘ℎ𝑞(𝑙)ℎ𝑞(𝑙)𝑘+2∑𝑗=1𝐿𝑎(𝑘)𝑙𝑗+∑𝑗=1𝐿𝑏𝑙𝑗𝑞(𝑙)𝑘)𝑞(𝑙)𝑘|𝑥𝑙|2+∑𝑗=1𝐿𝑏𝑙𝑗(|𝑥𝑗|2−|𝑥𝑙|2)+(2𝑞(𝑙)𝑘𝜂(𝑙)𝑘+𝑞(𝑙)𝑘𝜈(𝑙)𝑘)|𝑦𝑙|2(2𝜉(𝑙)𝑘−2𝐾𝑙+𝜇(𝑙)𝑘+∑ℎ=1𝑆𝛾𝑘ℎ𝑞(𝑙)ℎ𝑞(𝑙)𝑘+2∑𝑗=1𝐿𝑎(𝑘)𝑙𝑗+∑𝑗=1𝐿𝑏𝑙𝑗𝑞(𝑙)𝑘)𝑉𝑙(𝑥𝑙,𝑡,𝑘)+∑𝑗=1𝐿𝑏𝑙𝑗(|𝑥𝑗|2−|𝑥𝑙|2)+2𝑞(𝑙)𝑘𝜂(𝑙)𝑘+𝑞(𝑙)𝑘𝜈(𝑙)𝑘minℎ∈𝕊{𝑞(𝑙)ℎ}minℎ∈𝕊{𝑉𝑙(𝑦𝑙,𝑡−𝜏(𝑡),ℎ)}−𝜆1𝑙𝑉𝑙(𝑥𝑙,𝑡,𝑘)+𝜆2𝑙minℎ∈𝕊{𝑉𝑙(𝑦𝑙,𝑡−𝜏(𝑡),ℎ)}+∑𝑗=1𝐿𝑏𝑙𝑗(|𝑥𝑗|2−|𝑥𝑙|2).
On the other hand, for 𝑡∈[𝑠𝑖,𝑡𝑖+1), we can similarly obtain

≤≤𝑉𝑙(𝑥,𝑦𝑙,𝑡,𝑘)(2𝜉(𝑙)𝑘+𝜇(𝑙)𝑘+∑ℎ=1𝑆𝛾𝑘ℎ𝑞(𝑙)ℎ𝑞(𝑙)𝑘+2∑𝑗=1𝐿𝑎(𝑘)𝑙𝑗+∑𝑗=1𝐿𝑏𝑙𝑗𝑞(𝑙)𝑘)𝑉𝑙(𝑥𝑙,𝑡,𝑘)+∑𝑗=1𝐿𝑏𝑙𝑗(|𝑥𝑗|2−|𝑥𝑙|2)+2𝑞(𝑙)𝑘𝜂(𝑙)𝑘+𝑞(𝑙)𝑘𝜈(𝑙)𝑘minℎ∈𝕊{𝑞(𝑙)ℎ}minℎ∈𝕊{𝑉𝑙(𝑦𝑙,𝑡−𝜏(𝑡),ℎ)}𝜆2𝑙𝑉𝑙(𝑥𝑙,𝑡,𝑘)+𝜆2𝑙minℎ∈𝕊{𝑉𝑙(𝑦𝑙,𝑡−𝜏(𝑡),ℎ)}+∑𝑗=1𝐿𝑏𝑙𝑗(|𝑥𝑗|2−|𝑥𝑙|2).
Hence, condition A2 in Theorem 1 holds. Additionally, by Assumption 2 and 𝑞(𝑙)𝑘>0, we know that (𝑏𝑙𝑗)𝐿×𝐿 is strongly connected. And along each directed cycle  of (,(𝑏𝑙𝑗)𝐿×𝐿), there is ∑(𝑙,𝑗)∈()(|𝑥𝑗|2−|𝑥𝑙|2)=0. So, condition A3 in Theorem 1 is also satisfied. From (33) (or (34)), one can see that all conditions of Theorem 1 (or Theorem 2) are checked. Therefore, the trivial solution of system (1) is exponentially stable in mean square. The proof is completed. ◻

Numerical examples
In this section, we applied our theoretical results to studying the stabilization of the following coupled stochastic delayed neural networks with Markovian switching:

d𝑥𝑙(𝑡)=[−𝐷(𝑟(𝑡))𝑥𝑙(𝑡)+𝐵1(𝑟(𝑡))𝑓(𝑥𝑙(𝑡))+𝐵2(𝑟(𝑡))𝑓(𝑥𝑙(𝑡−𝜏(𝑡)))+∑𝑗=1𝐿ℎ𝑙𝑗(𝑥𝑙(𝑡),𝑥𝑗(𝑡),𝑟(𝑡))+𝑢𝑙(𝑡)]d𝑡+𝑔𝑙(𝑥𝑙(𝑡),𝑥𝑙(𝑡−𝜏(𝑡)),𝑟(𝑡))d𝑊(𝑡),
(35)
where 𝑡≥0, 𝑥𝑙(𝑡)∈ℝ𝑛 is the state of the lth neural network, 𝑙∈𝕃, 𝑢𝑙(𝑡) is the AIC in the form of (2), r(t) is the same Markov chain as before and for each 𝑘∈𝕊, 𝐷(𝑘)=diag{𝑑(𝑘)1,⋯,𝑑(𝑘)𝑛} is the self-feedback connection weight matrix, 𝐵1(𝑘)∈ℝ𝑛×𝑛 and 𝐵2(𝑘)∈ℝ𝑛×𝑛 are the connection weight matrices without and with time delay, respectively, 𝑓(𝑥𝑙)=(𝑓1(𝑥𝑙),⋯,𝑓𝑛(𝑥𝑙))T is the activation function, ℎ𝑙𝑗 is the coupling function, 𝑔𝑙 is the perturbation intensity function.

Suppose that there exists matrix 𝐿=(𝐿ıȷ)𝑛×𝑛 such that for any 𝑣=(𝑣1,⋯,𝑣𝑛)T, |𝑓ı(𝑣)|≤∑𝑛ȷ=1𝐿ıȷ|𝑣ȷ|, ı=1,⋯,𝑛. Let 𝜉(𝑙)𝑘=𝜆max{−𝐷(𝑘)+12[𝐵1(𝑘)𝐵T1(𝑘)+𝐵2(𝑘)𝐵T2(𝑘)]+12𝐿T𝐿}, 𝜂(𝑙)𝑘=12𝜆max{𝐿T𝐿}, 𝑙∈𝕃. Then we have

𝑥T𝑙[−𝐷(𝑘)𝑥𝑙+𝐵1(𝑘)𝑓(𝑥𝑙)+𝐵2(𝑘)𝑓(𝑦𝑙)]=−𝐷(𝑘)𝑥T𝑙𝑥𝑙+𝑥T𝑙𝐵1(𝑘)𝑓(𝑥𝑙)+𝑥T𝑙𝐵2(𝑘)𝑓(𝑦𝑙)≤−𝐷(𝑘)𝑥T𝑙𝑥𝑙+12𝑥T𝑙(𝐵1(𝑘)𝐵T1(𝑘)+𝐵2(𝑘)𝐵T2(𝑘))𝑥𝑙+12𝑓T(𝑥𝑙)𝑓(𝑥𝑙)+𝑓T(𝑦𝑙)𝑓(𝑦𝑙)≤𝑥T𝑙[−𝐷(𝑘)+12(𝐵1(𝑘)𝐵T1(𝑘)+𝐵2(𝑘)𝐵T2(𝑘))
(36)
+12𝐿T𝐿]𝑥𝑙+12𝑦T𝑙𝐿T𝐿𝑦𝑙≤𝜉(𝑙)𝑘|𝑥𝑙|2+𝜂(𝑙)𝑘|𝑦𝑙|2.
(37)
Moreover, suppose that there are nonnegative constants 𝜇(𝑙)𝑘, 𝜈(𝑙)𝑘 and 𝑎(𝑘)𝑙𝑗 such that

𝑥T𝑙ℎ𝑙𝑗(𝑥𝑙,𝑥𝑗,𝑘)≤𝑎(𝑘)𝑙𝑗(|𝑥𝑙|2+|𝑥𝑗|2),|𝑔𝑙(𝑡,𝑥𝑙,𝑦𝑙,𝑘)|2≤𝜇(𝑙)𝑘|𝑥𝑙|2+𝜈(𝑙)𝑘|𝑦𝑙|2.
(38)
So, it follows from (36) and (38) that Assumption 1 holds. Let 𝑎𝑙𝑗=max𝑘∈𝕊{𝑎(𝑘)𝑙𝑗}, we further assume that digraph (,(𝑎𝑙𝑗)𝐿×𝐿) is strongly connected (In this regard, Assumption 2 is satisfied).

Then according to Corollary 1, we know that if AIC 𝑢(𝑡)=(𝑢T1(𝑡),⋯,𝑢T𝐿(𝑡))T admits average control ratio 𝜃∈(0,1) and average control period 𝜔>0, and there are 𝑞(𝑙)=(𝑞(𝑙)1,⋯,𝑞(𝑙)𝑆)T, 𝑙∈𝕃, where 𝑞(𝑙)𝑘>0, such that (33) or (34) holds, where 𝜌>0, 𝜆1, 𝜆2, 𝜆3 are with the same meaning as defined above Corollary 1, then the trivial solution of system (35) is exponentially stable in mean square.

Based on above theory, in the following, we proceed to provide numerical simulations to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results. We consider a coupled stochastic 2-D neural networks (35) with 10 vertices, i.e., 𝑥𝑖(𝑡)=(𝑥𝑖1(𝑡),𝑥𝑖2(𝑡))T∈ℝ2, 𝐿=10. Take 𝕊={1,2}, Γ=(𝛾𝑘ℎ)2×2 with 𝛾11=−1, 𝛾12=1, 𝛾21=2, 𝛾22=−2, 𝜏(𝑡)=0.5|cos𝑡|≤𝜏=0.5, 𝐷(1)=diag{1.2,1.2}, 𝐷(2)=diag{0.8,0.8},

𝐵1(1)=(1.201.31),𝐵1(2)=(01.520),𝐵2(1)=(−0.1101.5), 𝐵2(2)=(−0.50.70.90.5)
𝑔𝑙(𝑥𝑙,𝑦𝑙,1)=0.2𝑥𝑙+0.2𝑦𝑙, 𝑔𝑙(𝑥𝑙,𝑦𝑙,2)=0.3𝑥𝑙+0.1𝑦𝑙,
𝑓𝑖(𝑥𝑖)=(𝐿𝑖1tanh(𝑥𝑖1)𝐿𝑖2tanh(𝑥𝑖2)),𝑖=1,2,ℎ𝑙𝑗(𝑥𝑙,𝑥𝑗,𝑘)=𝑎(𝑘)𝑙𝑗(sin(𝑥𝑙1)+sin(𝑥𝑗1)sin(𝑥𝑙2)+sin(𝑥𝑗2)),
where 𝑎(𝑘)𝑙𝑗≥0 are assumed to be as follows:

𝑎(1)1,2=𝑎(1)6,10=𝑎(2)8,10=0.1,𝑎(2)1,6=𝑎(2)6,7=𝑎(1)8,7=0.3,𝑎(1)3,4=𝑎(2)3,5=𝑎(2)10,5=𝑎(1)10,9=0.2,𝑎(1)2,3=𝑎(2)4,5=𝑎(1)5,1=𝑎(2)5,1=𝑎(1)7,6=𝑎(2)9,8=0.4,
and except for these, other elements 𝑎(𝑘)𝑙𝑗=0. Let 𝑎𝑙𝑗=max𝑘∈{1,2}{𝑎(𝑘)𝑙𝑗}. Then one can readily check that digraph (,(𝑎𝑙𝑗)10×10) is strongly connected. Moreover, by simple calculation, we can derive (36) and (38) hold with 𝜇(𝑙)1=𝜈(𝑙)1=0.08, 𝜇(𝑙)2=0.12, 𝜈(𝑙)2=0.04, 𝜉(𝑙)1=1.5483, 𝜉(𝑙)2=2.0607, 𝜂(𝑙)1=𝜂(𝑙)1=0.5. Based the coefficients chosen above, we can obtain the trajectories of solutions to system (35) without control in Fig. 1, from which, we can see that the trivial solution to system (35) without control input is unstable.

Full size image
In order to stabilization system (35), we design the AIC 𝑢𝑙(𝑡) with 𝐾𝑙=5, 𝑙=1,⋯,10, and the control intervals as

∪∞𝑖=0([10𝑖,10𝑖+0.1)∪[10𝑖+1.9,10𝑖+9.9)).
(39)
Then, it can be easily derived that the average control ratio 𝜃=0.81 and the average control period 𝜔=5, 𝜆1=5.0434, 𝜆2=1.144, 𝜆3=4.9566. Obviously, 𝜆1>𝜆2. By solving 𝜌−𝜆1+𝜆2e0.5𝜌=0, it yields 𝜌≈1.9739. Then it can be checked that (𝜌+𝜆2+𝜆3)𝜃≈6.5403>𝜆2+𝜆3+𝜌𝜏𝜔≈6.298, which means that (33) holds. Hence, the trivial solution to system (35) with AIC u(t) is exponentially stable in mean square. For any chosen initial conditions, we obtain the simulation results in Fig. 2, which illustrates the effectiveness of the control strategy.

Remark 8
In this numerical simulation, we can see that inf𝑖∈ℕ(𝑠𝑖−𝑡𝑖)=0.1<𝜏=0.5. This implies that the related criteria in [3, 19, 27, 45, 49] were not applicable to check the stability of system (35). In details, by using the related criteria in [3, 19, 27, 45, 49], condition (𝜌+𝜆2+𝜆3)𝜃>𝜆2+𝜆3+𝜌𝜏𝜔 will become (𝜌+𝜆2+𝜆3)inf𝑖∈ℕ(𝑠𝑖−𝑡𝑖)sup𝑖∈ℕ(𝑡𝑖+1−𝑡𝑖)>𝜆2+𝜆3+𝜌𝜏sup𝑖∈ℕ(𝑡𝑖+1−𝑡𝑖), i.e., (𝜌+𝜆2+𝜆3)0.17>𝜆2+𝜆3+𝜌𝜏7, which is clearly not satisfied in this numerical simulation. Those show that our results are less conservative.

On the other hand, if we take the control intervals as

∪∞𝑖=0([𝑖,𝑖+0.05)∪[𝑖+0.19,𝑖+0.95)).
(40)
and other values of parameters are not changed. In this situation, it is easy to see that average control ratio 𝜃=0.81 and average control period 𝜔=0.5. We have 𝜃𝜔=0.405<𝜏=0.5. Therefore, (33) cannot be checked (this corresponds to Theorem 1) since the upper bound of time delay is too large. However, simple calculation yields (𝜆1+𝜆3)(1−𝜃)=1.9<𝜌=1.9739, which means (34) is satisfied. Thus, we can conclude from Corollary 1 that the trivial solution of system (35) is exponentially stable in mean square. Taking the same initial conditions, we show the simulation results in Fig. 3.

Remark 9
In this numerical simulation, it should be noted that

Ψ=limsup𝑖→∞𝑡𝑖+1−𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖+1−𝑡𝑖=0.7368.
Then by the technique used in [11, 27, 44, 45, 53], it requires 𝜌−(𝜆1+𝜆3)(1−𝜓)>0, which obviously does not hold here. This demonstrate the effectiveness and the less conservatism of our results.

Conclusions
This paper studied the stabilization of stochastic delayed networks with Markovian switching via AIC from an average viewpoint. The concepts of average control ratio and average control period were proposed to characterize the distribution of control and rest intervals of AIC. It was worth noting that the AIC in this paper removed the strict restrictions on the maximum proportion of rest intervals or the lower bound of control intervals and upper bound of control periods that required in the classical AIC in previous literature. Hence, the conservatism is reduced compared with the existing works on AIC. In this paper, the intermittent control was activated synchronously. In our future work, we will consider the asynchronously intermittent control. Besides, in many applications, it is shown that noise can enhance the stability (see [10, 34]), in the future, we will pay more attention to the stabilization procedure due to the noise.
