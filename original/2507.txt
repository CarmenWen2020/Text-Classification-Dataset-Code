This paper proposes a novel ranking model under probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set (PHFS) by extending the idea of evidence theory (ET). PHFS is a strong variant of hesitant fuzzy set that associates occurrence probabilities to multiple membership grades. This offers flexibility to experts during preference elicitation and aids proper handling of uncertainty. Evidence theory is also a powerful concept for managing uncertainty/hesitation. By integrating Bayesian approximation with ET, a flexible ranking model is developed that complements ET. Due to the partial availability of evidences for decision-making under uncertainty, an approximation strategy is combined. Previous studies on PHFS have not handled hesitation of experts better and to alleviate the issue, a new regret-rejoice approach is put forward that calculates weights of criteria by handling hesitation efficiently. Ranking values from each expert are obtained that are further fused by the Maclaurin operator to get the final ranking order. These approaches are integrated into a framework and its usefulness is exemplified using renewable energy technology selection for Tamil Nadu. Finally, comparative analysis with other approaches reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed work.

Introduction
Multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) [11] is an inevitable routine activity in human life that offers a set of alternatives, which are rated according to a set of criteria either numerically or linguistically. Each criterion is connected with significance and based on a strategy, a suitable option is chosen. During the selection process, uncertainty and hesitation are implicit factors that must be handled rationally for proper decision-making. Hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) from Torra [54] is an interesting extension to classical fuzzy set [68] that allows experts/users to flexibly offer multiple membership grades as preferences for a certain situation. Driven by the practicality and resemblance to the real-time decision-making, researchers actively used HFS for MCDM [50].

Though HFS is flexible, it lacks the ability to associate different occurrence probability to each element. It must be noted that the occurrence probability describes the confidence value of each object that is used to describe an alternative based on a criterion. So, probability value is significant information that could be combined with membership grades for rational decision-making. Driven by the urge for a new preference structure, Zhu [77] introduced probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set (PHFS), which amalgamates the strength of both HFS and probability values. Inspired by the flexibility of PHFS, scholars actively used the preference information for MCDM [61].

Brief review on PHFS-based MCDM
The inception of the idea of PHFS [77] led to several improvements in the decision models for MCDM. Xu and Zhou [75] adopted value at risk concept to form a decision model under PHFS for assessment of stocks. Zhou and Xu [76] further evaluated research candidates by preference relation concept in PHFS and determining probabilities of the preference relations. Zhang et al. [70] defined new operational laws and fusion operators along with their properties to evaluate safety aspects of an industry. Song et al. [52] developed an integrated approach under PHFS with comparison laws, chart analysis and possibility-based ranking for MCDM. Bashir et al. [1] later developed consistency algorithms with probabilistic hesitant fuzzy preference relations for MCDM. Hao et al. [17] gave the genesis for the probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy set (PDHFS) that expresses membership and non-membership grades along with probability and utilized the set for risk assessment. Tian et al. [53] made an assessment of projects for venture capitalist by using prospect theory and arrived at consensus of opinions with PHFPRs. Zhang et al. [73] gave a new extension to TODIM approach under PHFS for appropriate ranking of venture capitalist by considering the base of dominance theory. Recently, Wu et al. [58] integrated grey model with PHFS and extended TOPSIS approach for emergency decision-making. Li and Wang [30] developed approaches for consistency check and repair in PHFPR and tested its feasibility with MCDM. Li and Wang [29] developed new comparison schemes along with two outranking methods under PHFS for suitable selection of research candidates for a doctoral study. Li et al. [31] proposed an integrated model with best worst approach and dominance degree to choose the appropriate investment company under PHFS context. He and Xu [18] prepared a novel reference point approach with distance measure for assessment of water conservation projects. Garg and Kaur [12] introduced several correlation measures under PDHFS along with their properties to from a theoretical base that was framed into a decision model for personnel selection. Farhadinia and Viedma-Herrera [9] ameliorated the idea of PHFS and presented a family of T and S norms along with aggregation operators for hospital selection. Li et al. [20] ameliorated normalized PHFS and introduced new Euclidean distance-based ORESTE approach for project selection in university for academic research. Guo et al. [15] prepared an integrated model with Choquet integral, Hamming distance, and TODIM method under PHFS to make an apt choice of location for CO2 storage. Farhadinia et al. [8] presented PHFS-based entropy measures under two key uncertainty concepts namely fuzziness and non-specificity for evaluation of strategies. Li et al. [28] developed algorithms for consistency check and repair with modified distance measure under normalized PHFS for candidate selection. Garg and Kaur [13] proposed aggregation operators along with probability determination for quantifying gestures during brain hemorrhage under PDHFS.

Research lacunae
From the review performed above, it is clear that the PHFS is a strong preference structure for MCDM, but there are some interesting research lacunae, which are identified and they are given below.

1.
Understanding and capturing the hesitation of experts during preference elicitation over each criterion is an open challenge.

2.
Modeling uncertainty/hesitation of each expert during ranking of alternatives is also a crucial challenge.

3.
Intuitively, it is clear that obtaining complete distribution of evidences in the preference space is not possible due to implicit uncertainty and hence, modeling the preferences for ranking is an interesting challenge.

4.
Finally, aggregating the ranks of alternatives from each expert into a holistic ranking order for MCDM is another key challenge.

Contributions in this paper
Inspired by the research challenges/lacunae presented in Subsection 1.2, the contributions are given in this paper to handle them as follows:

1.
Regret-rejoice approach is proposed under PHFS context for calculating weights of criteria. Intuitively, the method captures the hesitation of experts during preference elicitation. Kao [22] strongly argued on the urge for a methodical calculation of weights of criteria by properly considering the hesitation of experts, which motivated the contribution.

2.
Evidence theory (ET) is extended to PHFS for ranking alternatives as it is a powerful concept that can handle uncertainty during ranking of alternatives. The theory is developed on the basis of evidences and propositions that are modeled from the preference information of experts.

3.
Due to implicit hesitation, complete distribution of evidences is not available and so there is an urge for approximation technique. Driven by the claim from Voobraak [55], Bayesian approximation is integrated with ET for ranking of alternatives. To better handle the partial preference distribution (evidences), ET is integrated with Bayesian approximation.

4.
Finally, operational laws are utilized to aggregate ranks from different experts to obtain a holistic preference order of options.

The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 provides a discussion on the extant models that use regret theory and evidence theory for MCDM. In Sect. 3, the core contributions are explained in detail. Section 4 describes the usefulness of the proposed framework by using a numerical example. Later, in Sect. 5, comparative analysis is carried out to clearly bring out the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed work. Finally, in Sect. 6, concluding remarks along with future research directions are provided.

Related works and preliminaries
In this section, we provide a brief discussion on state-of-the-art decision models that utilized regret theory and evidence theory concepts.

Regret theory
Regret theory (RT) studies psychological behavior of experts and was first proposed by Bell [2]. They thought that the ultimate decision outcome is not only influenced by the assignment that the decision expert (DE) considers to select, but also wedged by the other assignments. If the DE finds that selecting another option will lead to better outcomes, he may sense contrite; in contrast, he will be pleased. Thus, DEs will evade selecting an option that makes them regret, that is, the DEs are likely to evade regret. Recently, RT has gathered significant concentration from scholars and they have applied RT to various settings viz., MCDM and investment. Zhang et al. [71] applied the RT to solve the MCDM problem under multidimensional preference information with FS. Guo et al. [16] gave a multi-objective grey target MCDM model based on RT and HFS, which is applied to handle with the problem where the criteria values are in interval grey number. Stochastic MCDM discusses to the decision-making concern that its probability of natural state can be expected, and its criterion value under each probability is changed. Currently, MCDM problem is a valuable study area. Though, there are few researches on the MCDM issues of RT, Qian et al. [46] explained the grey-sense MCDM concern by describing the grey perceived utility degree with the RT by dealing the issue that criteria weights and natural probability are fully unknown, Zhu [78] gave an MCDM model with the RT and ET. Generally, people perform in bounded rationality in realistic decision processes due to incomplete information, cognition restriction, and time limitation [7]. Zhang et al. [72] gave fuzzy regret/rejoice function, perceived utility procedure and group consistency index using RT and developed a MCDM model based on multidimensional preference data. Peng and Yang [44] integrated the interval-valued fuzzy set with RT to develop a MCDM model.

Recently, Ji et al. [20] developed the power, regret/rejoice and perceived utility degrees of probability multi-valued neutrosophic linguistic sets and introduced a RT-based performance assessment tool. Chen et al. [5] discussed a bounded rationality procedure using triangular fuzzy axiomatic scheme and extended RT to explain a logistic provider assessment problem. Qu et al. [48] developed an MCDM model with the RT and group satisfaction for the interval-value dual hesitant fuzzy sets. Peng et al. [43] established a decision support system (DSS) by combining Z-numbers, RT and ELECTRE III to deal with the new energy investment risk assessment issue. Ren et al. [49] used a RT-based MCDM problem with incomplete criteria weight information which is articulated by intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs). Liu et al. [36] presented an MCDM model with the RT and PHFSs to handle the complex situations. Liao et al. [33] gave an integrated model to solve MCDM concerns allowing for the interaction among heterogeneous criteria using the RT. Liu et al. [35] discussed a combined sustainable supplier assessment approach with the RT and QUALIFLEX model under a 2-dimensional uncertain linguistic variable (2-DULV) setting.

Evidence theory/ evidential reasoning
Evidential reasoning (ER) is a way of evidence fusion pioneered by Yang and Xu [63] based on evidence doctrine, which could be applied to exemplify partial information directly and to handle with issues of evaluation in the linguistic setting. The evaluation outcome achieved utilizing ER is a set of degree of beliefs related with a predefined frame of discernment. Currently, numerous researchers explained to the combination ER with FSs, which is generally known as fuzzy evidential reasoning (FER) method, to perform an organized risk evaluation. For instance, a semi quantitative model with the FER was initiated by Deng et al. [6] and Liu et al. [34] to accomplish risk assessment for complex structures because of deficiency of data and insufficient understanding of the failure tools; a risk evaluation tool with the FER was implemented by Mokhtari et al. [41], Yang and Wang [66] and Zhang et al. [69] because of the objective data is on occasion inadequate in offshore engineering structure; in the occurrence of multiple DEs providing diverse and uncertain decisions on risk factors, Certa et al. [3] accompanied a failure mode and associated effects study by FER; John et al. [21] constructed a method with the FER to handle the issue of risk evaluation of seaport operations under FSs. The ER model is proposed based on decision doctrine and D-S doctrine, and it is usually applied to handle MCDM concerns with uncertain settings [64, 65]. In last two decades, widespread study devoted to the ER model and its generalization have been accompanied to assess MCDM concerns, namely smart home contractor assessment [45], navigational risk assessment [69], data classification [60], medical quality evaluation [25], trauma outcome prediction [26], and others.

Recently, Zhang et al. [74] extended the concept of ER to ER using Gini coefficient (ERGC) to compute the weights of evidence. Yang et al. [65] presented a DSS for dealing customer complaints and proposed an ER rule-based classifier as the main factor of the model. Wu et al. [57] proposed a model for dealing ships without command by combining the ER and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) in the emergency decision-making. Xue et al. [62] proposed a hazard evaluation tool using multi-scale adjacent linguistic terms, called HFLTSs to handle uncertainties related with complex settings and subjective assessments. Yuan and Luo [67] developed a MCDM model with the entropy and ER for IFSs with unknown or partially unknown weight information. Wei et al. [56] proposed a model with the ER under FSs to determine the overall risk level of a construction project. Chen et al. [4] gave a new ER model with uncertain parameters to create a nonlinear optimization tool to assess the complex aerospace systems performance. Liang et al. [32] developed a novel uncertain MCDM model, called multi-granular linguistic RT doctrine, which can deal with incomplete and modified preferences for assessing renewable energy project risk. Huang et al. [19] proposed a combined model with the Fault Tree and Fuzzy D-S ER to analyze the railway dangerous goods transportation system (RDNGTS) accident. Qin et al. [47] presented a combined tool with the interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) and ER, which is capable to overawe certain drawbacks of the orthodox FMEA procedure and handle with uncertainties more proficiently. Fu et al. [10] constructed the combinational reliability of each attribute for each alternative from the novel reliability of attribute with the deliberation of a DE’s risk attitude.

Preliminaries
This section provides some rudimentary concepts that form the base for our research work. Brief discussions on HFS [54] and PHFS concepts are made.

Definition 1
(Xia and Xu [59]): Set 𝑉 is fixed; an HFS on 𝑉 is a function ℎ𝑓 that generates a subset in the unit interval. Mathematically,

𝑉¯={𝑣,ℎ𝑓𝑉¯(𝑣)|𝑣∈𝑉}
(1)
Definition 2
(Xu and Zhou [61]): Set 𝑉 is fixed; an PHFS on 𝑉 is a pair that is mathematically defined as,

𝑉𝑝={𝑣,ℎ𝑓𝑉𝑝(𝛾𝑖|𝑝𝑖)|𝑣∈𝑉}
(2)
where ℎ𝑓𝑉𝑝(𝛾𝑖|𝑝𝑖) has membership grades and occurrence probability associated with the grade for 𝑣 on the set 𝑉𝑝, 0≤𝛾𝑖≤1, 0≤𝑝𝑖≤1 and ∑𝑖𝑝𝑖≤1.

Note 1: It must be noted that the structure allows partial ignorance and hence, sum of probabilities instance wise can be less than or equal to one. By normalization, sum is brought to unity. Let ℎ𝑓𝑉𝑝(𝛾𝑖|𝑝𝑖)=ℎ𝑓𝑖=(𝛾𝑘𝑖|𝑝𝑘𝑖) be a probabilistic hesitant fuzzy information (PHFI) with 𝑘=1,2,…,#ℎ𝑓𝑖. Collection of PHFI forms a PHFS.

Definition 3
(Xu and Zhou [61]): ℎ𝑓1 and ℎ𝑓2 are two PHFI. Some arithmetic operations are,

ℎ𝑓1ℎ𝑓2=∪𝑎=1,2,…#ℎ𝑓1,𝑏=1,2,…,#ℎ𝑓𝑏{𝛾𝑎1+𝛾𝑏2−𝛾𝑎1𝛾𝑏2|𝑝𝑎1𝑝𝑏1}
(3)
ℎ𝑓1ℎ𝑓2=∪𝑎=1,2,…#ℎ𝑓1,𝑏=1,2,…,#ℎ𝑓𝑏{𝛾𝑎1𝛾𝑏2|𝑝𝑎1𝑝𝑏1}
(4)
ℎ𝑓𝜆1=∪𝑎=1,2,…#ℎ𝑎{(𝛾1)𝜆|𝑝1}𝜆≥0
(5)
ℎ𝑓𝑐2=∪𝑏=1,2,…#ℎ𝑏{(1−𝛾2)|𝑝2}
(6)
𝜆ℎ𝑓1=∪𝑎=1,2,…#ℎ𝑎{1−(1−𝛾1)𝜆|𝑝1}𝜆≥0
(7)
Operations such as addition, multiplication, power operation, complement, and scalar multiplication are depicted in Eqs. 3–7. Work done in [61] provides interesting properties with these arithmetic operations.

Novel PHFI-based decision model
This is the core section that puts forward new approaches under PHFI that are integrated into a novel decision model for rational MCDM.

PHFI-based regret theory approach
This section offers a new extension to the regret theory with PHFI for calculating weights of criteria. Commonly used weight calculation approaches can be classified into two perspectives viz., fully unknown and partly known information. In the former context, methods such as analytical hierarchy process [42], entropy measures [23, 40], and SWARA [37] are used. In the latter context, optimization models are used. The latter context incurs an overhead of handling the partial information effectively and in several practical decision problems, elicitation of partial information is difficult.

Regret theory-based weight calculation approach comes under the former classification. Besides, the approach can effectively handle the regret-rejoice conditions of experts and can capture hesitation in a better way. Further, literature review performed above clearly shows the usefulness of the approach. Driven by the simplicity, elegance, and usefulness of the approach, in this section, a procedure is developed with regret theory under PHFI context for criteria weight calculation.

Step 1Construct a criteria weight assessment matrix of order 𝑠×𝑛 with PHFI. 𝑠 signifies the number of DEs and 𝑛 signifies the number of criteria.

Step 2

PHFI is transformed into single values by using Eq. 8. 𝑠×𝑛 matrix with single value is obtained.

𝑠ℎ𝑣𝑖𝑗=∑𝑘=1#ℎ(𝛾𝑘𝑖𝑗.𝑝𝑘𝑖𝑗)
(8)
where 𝑠ℎ𝑣𝑖𝑗 is the single value for the 𝑖𝑡ℎ option over the 𝑗𝑡ℎ attribute.

Step 3 Apply Eq. 9 to determine the Neumann utility values whose base idea is adapted from [14].

𝑈𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑗=∑𝑖=1𝑚(𝑣𝑛𝑓(𝑠ℎ𝑣𝑖𝑗)+𝑅𝑒𝑇(𝑣𝑛𝑓(𝑠ℎ𝑣𝑖𝑗))−𝑣𝑛𝑓𝑝𝑜𝑠(𝑠ℎ𝑣𝑖𝑗))
(9)
where 𝑣𝑛𝑓(∗) is the von Neumann function, 𝑅𝑒𝑇(∗) is the regret/rejoice factor, and 𝑣𝑛𝑓𝑝𝑜𝑠(∗) is the positive type function value that considers maximum value for benefit type attribute and minimum value for cost type attribute.

𝑣𝑛𝑓(∗)=∗𝜏 where 𝜏 is the power factor in the unit interval and 𝑅𝑒𝑇(𝑣𝑛𝑓(∗))=1−𝑒−𝑟.(𝑣𝑛𝑓(∗)) where 𝑟 is the risk aversion value in the unit interval.

Step 4

Utility values are normalized to achieve the criteria weights and it is obtained from Eq. (10).

𝑐𝑤𝑡𝑗=𝑈𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑗∑𝑗𝑈𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑗
(10)
where 𝑐𝑤𝑡𝑗 is the weight of the 𝑗𝑡ℎ criterion for all 𝑗=1,2,…,𝑛.

These weights are in the unit interval with the sum of weights equal to unity.

PHFI-based evidence theory approach
This section offers a new extension to ET on PHFI setting for ranking alternatives from the perception of each expert. This idea is introduced to realize the perspective of each expert and how well hesitation can be captured from each decision matrix. This directly reflects the cognition and physical conditions of each expert and provides a rational ranking based on the preference information offered by the experts.

Inspired by these intuitive claims, in this section, a novel ranking approach is developed by extending ET to PHFI. Propositions 𝐵=(𝑏1,𝑏2,…,𝑏𝑚) are considered whose base probability assessment (BPA) is a mapping defined by 𝑃(.):2𝑏→[0,1] with 𝑃(𝜙)=0 and sum of BPAs equals unity. It must be inferred that the ET is a powerful concept for dealing uncertainty, but the combination rule of ET needs complete combination space to generate the result, which is not possible in practical cases. To mitigate the issue, Voobraak [55] introduced the idea of integrating Bayesian approximation with ET to better handle the combination space. This integration promoted its usage actively in MCDM and led to better management of uncertainty and vagueness.

Driven by the unique property, we utilize evidence theory-based Bayesian approximation (EBA) approach to rank alternatives with PHFI. A new ranking approach is put forward with EBA that allows assessment of alternatives from the perspective of each expert. Steps for ranking are discussed.

Step 1 Form 𝑠 decision matrices of order 𝑚×𝑛 by PHFI. Here 𝑠 represents the number of experts, 𝑚 and 𝑛 denote the number of alternatives and criteria, respectively.

Step 2

Convert the PHFI into single value by Eq. 8 for each element of the decision matrices. This forms 𝑠ℎ𝑣𝑖𝑗 for each decision matrix. Thus, 𝑃𝑙𝑗(𝑏𝑖)=𝑠ℎ𝑣𝑖𝑗

Step 3

Determine the weighted evidences by Eqs. 11−12. Weights of criteria from Sect. 3.1 are utilized for the analysis.

𝑃𝑙𝑗(𝑏𝑖)=𝑐𝑤𝑡𝑗𝑃𝑙𝑗(𝑏𝑖)
(11)
𝑃𝑙𝑗(𝐵)=1−𝑐𝑤𝑡𝑗∑𝑖=1𝑚𝑃𝑙𝑗(𝑏𝑖)
(12)
where 𝑃𝑙𝑗(𝑏𝑖) is the BPA of an evidence for the 𝑖𝑡ℎ alternative rated over 𝑗𝑡ℎ criterion by the 𝑙𝑡ℎ expert and 𝑃𝑙𝑗(𝐵) is the BPA of a set 𝐵.

Step 4 Determine the Bayesian approximation for the evidence function by Eq. 13.

𝐵𝐴𝑋𝑙𝑖𝑗=⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪∑𝐷⊆𝑏𝑖𝑃(𝐷)0𝑖𝑓𝑏𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒
(13)
where |∗| is the cardinality of ∗.

Step 5 Combination rule is applied to each criterion to obtain the aggregated value of the evidences for all alternatives from each expert.

𝐵𝐴𝑋𝑙(𝑏𝑖)=⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪∏𝑗=1𝑛𝐵𝐴𝑋𝑙𝑗∑∩𝑏𝑖≠0∏𝑗=1𝑛𝐵𝐴𝑋𝑙𝑗(𝑏𝑖)0(𝑏𝑖)𝑖𝑓𝑏𝑖≠0𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒
(14)
where 𝐵𝐴𝑋𝑙(𝑏𝑖) is the aggregated Bayesian value of evidences from each expert.

Step 6 Aggregate these values to assess the final ranking of options that leads to the formation of a preference order. From Eq. 14, it is observe that each expert yields a vector of order 1×𝑚 that represents the EBA values for all alternatives. As discussed earlier, the perspective of each expert is reflected by these vectors and to obtain a holistic ranking order, we aggregate these values by Eq. (15).

𝑅𝑉(𝑔,𝜆1,𝜆2,…,𝜆𝑔)𝑖=⎛⎝⎜⎜⎛⎝⎜⎜1−⎛⎝⎜⎜∏𝑙=1𝑠(1−∏𝑙𝑙=1𝑔𝐵𝐴𝑋𝜆𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑗)𝑒𝑤𝑡𝑙⎞⎠⎟⎟⎞⎠⎟⎟⎞⎠⎟⎟1∑𝑙𝑙𝜆𝑙𝑙
(15)
where 𝑔=⌈𝑠2⌉, 𝜆1,𝜆2,…,𝜆𝑔 are risk appetite parameters that take values from the set {1,2,…,𝑠}, 𝑒𝑤𝑡𝑙 is the weight of the 𝑙𝑡ℎ expert.

It must be noted that the experts’ weights are in the unit interval and the sum equals unity. They are calculated methodically by following the procedure proposed in Sect. 3.4. 𝑅𝑉𝑖 is the rank value of the 𝑖𝑡ℎ alternative. By arranging these values in the descending order, ranking order is obtained.

Theorem 1
The formula proposed in Eq. 13 obeys the monotonicity, idempotent, bounded, and commutative properties.

(Idempotent) – If 𝐵𝐴𝑋=𝐵𝐴𝑋𝑙 for all 𝑙=1,2,…𝑠; then 𝑅𝑉(𝑔,𝜆1,𝜆2,…,𝜆𝑔)𝑖=𝐵𝐴𝑋.

(Commutative) – If 𝐵𝐴𝑋′𝑙 is any permutation of 𝐵𝐴𝑋𝑙; then 𝑅𝑉(𝑔,𝜆1,𝜆2,…,𝜆𝑔)𝑖(𝐵𝐴𝑋′𝑖)=𝑅𝑉(𝑔,𝜆1,𝜆2,…,𝜆𝑔)𝑖(𝐵𝐴𝑋𝑖)

(Bounded) – If 𝐵𝐴𝑋−=𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑙(𝐵𝐴𝑋𝑙) and 𝐵𝐴𝑋+=𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑙(𝐵𝐴𝑋𝑙); then 𝐵𝐴𝑋−≤𝑅𝑉(𝑔,𝜆1,𝜆2,…,𝜆𝑔)𝑖(𝐵𝐴𝑋𝑙)≤𝐵𝐴𝑋+ holds true.

(Monotonicity) – If 𝐵𝐴𝑋″′ for all 𝑙=1,2,…,𝑠 is another set such that every element of 𝐵𝐴𝑋″′ is greater than or equal 𝐵𝐴𝑋𝑙; then 𝑅𝑉(𝑔,𝜆1,𝜆2,…,𝜆𝑔)𝑖(𝐵𝐴𝑋″𝑙)≥𝑅𝑉(𝑔,𝜆1,𝜆2,…,𝜆𝑔)𝑖(𝐵𝐴𝑋𝑙).

PHFI-based entropy measure
This section offers a new generalization of Shannon [51] entropy measure with PHFI for evaluating the weights of each DE. Corresponding to the literature review, it is clear that DEs’ weights are directly achieved, which causes subjective biases and inaccuracies. To add strong evidence to the claim, Koksalmis and Kabak [24] prepared a review and pinpointed the merits of methodical weight calculation of experts.

Driven by the claim, here, a model is suggested for expert weight assessment. Shannon [51] entropy is the measure of randomness and it is crucial for researchers in MCDM to capture the hesitation in the process [38,39,40]. Clearly, the decision matrices provided by the experts incur certain hesitation/confusion due to pressure and time bounds, which must be captured for rational calculation of experts’ weights. Since entropy formulates this idea, we extend Shannon entropy to PHFI for experts’ weight calculation. Stepwise procedure is given as follows:

Step 1 Find decision matrix from each DE, which of order 𝑚×𝑛. Here 𝑚 and 𝑛 denote the number of alternatives and criteria, respectively.

Step 2 Calculate deviation values criteria wise for each decision matrix by Eq. (16).

𝜎𝑙𝑗=1𝑚−1∑𝑖=1𝑚∣∣∣𝑠ℎ𝑣𝑙𝑖𝑗−𝑠ℎ𝑣𝑙𝑗⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯∣∣∣‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾⎷
(16)
where 𝑠ℎ𝑣𝑙𝑖𝑗 is the single value obtained from Eq. 8 for the 𝑖𝑡ℎ alternative over 𝑗𝑡ℎ criterion in the 𝑙𝑡ℎ decision matrix, 𝑠ℎ𝑣𝑙𝑗⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ mean value, and 𝜎𝑙𝑗 is the deviation value.

Step 3

By Eq. 16, we obtain 𝑠 vectors of order 1×𝑛, which are deviation values. Apply Eq. 17 to calculate the entropy value for each expert and it signifies the potential information gain incurred by each expert.

𝑆𝐸𝑙=−(1𝑙𝑛(𝑛)∑𝑗=1𝑛𝜎𝑙𝑗∑𝑗𝜎𝑙𝑗𝑙𝑛(𝜎𝑙𝑗∑𝑗𝜎𝑙𝑗))
(17)
where 𝑆𝐸𝑙 is the entropy value of the 𝑙𝑡ℎ expert, 𝜎𝑙𝑛𝑒𝑡 is the net deviation degree of the 𝑙𝑡ℎ expert.

Step 4 Relative importance (weight) of each expert is obtained by Eq. 18.

𝑒𝑤𝑡𝑙=𝑆𝐸𝑙∑𝑙𝑆𝐸𝑙
(18)
It must be noted that the vector values obtained from Eq. 18 are used as input values for calculating 𝑅𝑉𝑖 formulated in Eq. 15. Equation 18 gives weight values associated with each of the expert.

Theorem 2:

Entropy measure proposed in Eq. (17) obeys the following properties.

(P1). 𝑆𝐸𝑙(ℎ𝑓)=0 if and only if ℎ𝑓={0(1)}𝑜𝑟ℎ𝑓={1(1)}; 𝑆𝐸𝑙(0(𝑝),1(1−𝑝))=0;

(P2). 𝐴𝑆𝐸𝑙(ℎ𝑓)=max(𝑆𝐸𝑙) when ℎ𝑓=(1(1)) and 𝐴𝑆𝐸𝑙(ℎ𝑓)=𝐴𝑆𝐸𝑙(ℎ𝑓(𝑝,1−𝑝));

(P3). 𝑆𝐸𝑙(ℎ𝑓(1))≤𝑆𝐸𝑙(ℎ𝑓(2)) if ℎ𝑓(1) and ℎ𝑓(2) satisfy 𝑣𝑙𝑗(ℎ𝑓(1))≤𝑣𝑙𝑗(ℎ𝑓(2))≤0.5 or 𝑣𝑙𝑗(ℎ𝑓(1))≥𝑣𝑙𝑗(ℎ𝑓(2))≥0.5;

(P4). 𝐴𝑆𝐸𝑙(ℎ𝑓)=𝐴𝑆𝐸𝑙(ℎ𝑓𝑐) if and only if 𝐴𝑆𝐸𝑙(ℎ𝑓)=𝐴𝑆𝐸𝑙(ℎ𝑓(𝑝,1−𝑝)).

Proof
Please refer Appendix for the proof.

Figure 1a presents a research model under PHFS that could be effectively used for MCDM. Its clear working procedure is depicted in Fig. 1b. The core idea of the model is to promote personal perception of experts into ranking of alternatives that is lacking in existing models under PHFS. To this end, the model obtains 𝑠 matrices of order 𝑚×𝑛 that use PHFS information. Similarly, another matrix of order 𝑠×𝑛 is obtained for criteria weight calculation. By the regret/rejoice approach, a vector of order 1×𝑛 is obtained to represent the weight of criteria. Later, a vector of order 1×𝑠 is obtained by the entropy measure that corresponds to the weight of the experts. Ranking from each expert’s perception is obtained by applying the EBA approach (evidence theory with Bayesian approximation) on the decision matrices with criteria weights. This offers individual rank that is fused by Maclaurin aggregation approach. The holistic rank of order 1×𝑚 is obtained by this approach that not only uses methodically estimated experts’ weights, but also captures the interdependencies among experts.

Numerical illustration – Renewable energy source assessment for TN, India
This section offers a real case example of renewable energy source assessment for Tamil Nadu (TN), India. TN is a popular state in India that is ranked eleventh in terms of the area (1,30,000 sq. km). TN is the only state that spans over the western and eastern ghats and has rich potential for renewable energy (RE) sources. As a part of the India’s smart city initiative, 13 cities of TN were chosen and usage of RE in these cities becomes crucial for reducing the carbon footprint and to achieve sustainable growth. As per the energy report from India, around 17.2% of total RE is produced from TN and based on the demographics of TN, the state is gifted with natural energy sources viz., solar, water, wind, and biogas. Government of TN planned to initiate the scheme as people movement so that the contribution becomes significant and people gain awareness on the ecofriendly aspects.

Genesis for the laudable initiative began in 1984, when TN energy development agency (TEDA) was constituted with the core focus on satisfying the energy demand of TN and India in a bigger picture. TEDA actively supports the government by providing a detailed scope of different REs and encourages RandD activities related to REs. TEDA strongly motivated TN into RE generation and with their advice and apt planning, TN produced 8,500 MW of wind power, followed by 2,300 MW and 3,900 MW of hydro and solar power, respectively. Popular solar power generation projects viz., Rays Power Infra, Raasi Green Energy, ReNew Solar, and Solitaire BTN Solar are introduced in TN so that each project generates 100 MW power. Further, TN also started wind projects such as Gamesa wind farm and Muppandal wind farm to generate 850 KW and 25.5 MW of wind power, respectively. TEDA as a private agency had the potential to generate 415 MW of wind power and serves as a largest distributor of wind energy in the country. All these initiatives are laid by TN to reduce the destruction of the ecosystem and promote sustainable growth. India committed itself to reduce greenhouse gas levels by 30–35% by 2030 and to promote 40% usage of REs for their energy demand in the Paris Accord.

Driven by these interesting facts and to adequately manage the energy demand of smart cities in TN, in this section, we deploy the proposed framework to rationally select an apt RE source for TN. To achieve the goal, a panel of three experts is constituted with namely senior professor from energy management 𝑒𝑥𝑡1, senior scientist 𝑒𝑥𝑡2, and finance and audit personnel 𝑒𝑥𝑡3. These experts made a rigorous analysis of the possible REs and shortlisted four potential sources for analysis namely hydro 𝑟𝑡1, solar 𝑟𝑡2, wind 𝑟𝑡3, and biomass 𝑟𝑡4. Based on brainstorming sessions and detailed analysis, six criteria are chosen for assessment of the four REs. These six criteria strongly adhere to the sustainable aspects and they are considered as security 𝑐𝑟1, land usage 𝑐𝑟2, sustainable governmental policies 𝑐𝑟3, durability of sustainable energy 𝑐𝑟4, total cost 𝑐𝑟5, and pollution 𝑐𝑟6. Last two criteria are cost type and the rest are benefit type. Steps to rank the RESs are given as.

Step 1 Generate three matrices with PHFI, each of order 4×6. Each matrix provides the rating from an expert on each RE based on a particular criterion. Table 1 shows the input matrix from each expert that provides his/her rating of each RE based on a specific criterion. PHFEs are adopted by experts for rating. The representation is adapted from Definition 2 where each HFE is associated with an occurrence probability.

Step 2 Form a criteria weight assessment matrix with PHFI, which is of order 3×6. This provides the rating of each criterion by an expert. Calculate the criteria weight of order 1×6 by Sect. 3.1.

Step 3

Calculate the DEs’ weight by Sect. 3.3 and matrices from Step 1.

The information theory measure is adopted to determine the experts’ weights as they effectively reflect the uncertainty/hesitation in the process of preference elucidation. Based on Eqs. 16–17 the matrices are constructed (as shown above). The weights are given by 0.3313, 0.3428, and 0.3259, respectively.

Step 4 Obtain the ranking of REs from each expert that is in turn fused to form a holistic rank that is given by Sect. 3.2.

Step 5:

Conduct sensitivity analysis of experts’ weights to recognize its effects of the holistic priorities. Clearly Fig. 2 infers that the ranking order does not change even after ample variations are taken to the DEs’ weights and it reveals that the proposed model is robust.

Table 2 is also an input matrix that is used by the criteria weight calculation procedure to determine the weight vector rationally. Procedure proposed in Sect. 3.1 is adopted to determine the reject/rejoice factor based on the utility function and the values are given by 0.1506, 0.1668, 0.1502, 0.1619, 0.1844, and 0.1861, respectively. Equations 9 and 10 are utilized for computing the criteria weights.

Matrices presented above are calculated by Eq. 13 that are further aggregated to form Table 3, which depicts the value of each RE from each expert. Equation 14 is utilized for this purpose and by Eq. 15, rank values are computed as 𝑟𝑡4=0.6101≻𝑟𝑡3=0.2177≻𝑟𝑡2=0.2100≻𝑟𝑡1=0.1993. By varying Des’ weights it is inferred that the priority order remains same indicating that the introduced model is highly robust and details on the same are given in the next step. Besides, the proposed model.

Comparison with existing PHFS-based decision models
This section is intended to showcase the advantages and flaws of the introduced model by comparing with existing decision models. For retaining the homogeneity during comparison, decision models such as Zhang et al. [74] model, Li and Wang [29] model, and Li and Wang [30] model are considered. These models actively use PHFS information and Table 4 presents the investigation based on different factors that are imbibed from the literature and intuition.

Certain crucial novelties/innovations of the proposed model are listed below.

1.
Individual perception of experts is considered in the proposed model that is lacking in existing PHFS-based models. As a result, the personal choice of each expert is gained, which is potential information to arrive at a holistic decision related to a MCDM problem.

2.
Furthermore, hesitation of experts is carefully handled with the help of RT that supports criteria weight calculation. Intuitively, higher weight value for a criterion indicates that the experts are rejoiceful and confident about the criterion and its impact on the alternative.

3.
Unlike existing PHFS-based models, proposed work methodically determines the weights of expert by properly understanding the hesitation during preference elucidation. Moreover, the measure of randomness is effectively governed in the weight calculation process by formulating entropy measures.

4.
To intuitively complement ET approach, Bayesian approximation is integrated with ET and an effective individual/personal ranking is obtained. This aspect of rank calculation is unique compared to the existing PHFS-based decision models.

5.
Finally, a holistic ranking order is obtained by properly capturing the interdependencies among experts. Also, experts’ weights that are determined methodically are used for the aggregation process to obtain a rational holistic ranking of alternatives.

To further recognize the advantage of the introduced model, data are fed into the proposed and existing models to infer that ranking order. Further, Spearman correlation is utilized to assess the uniqueness of preference order. Ranking order from the proposed model is 𝑟𝑡4≻𝑟𝑡3≻𝑟𝑡2≻𝑟𝑡1, while the ranking order from Zhang et al. [74] is 𝑟𝑡2≻𝑟𝑡4≻𝑟𝑡3≻𝑟𝑡1, (Li and Wang [29]) is 𝑟𝑡2≻𝑟𝑡3≻𝑟𝑡4≻𝑟𝑡1, and (Li and Wang [30]) is 𝑟𝑡2≻𝑟𝑡3≻𝑟𝑡4≻𝑟𝑡1. The correlation values between proposed and other methods are given by ((1,0); (0.4, 0.6); (0.2, 0.8); (0.2, 0.8)) and this evidently displays that the developed model provides a unique preference order and adopts an unique formulation compared to its counterparts. Intuitively, we can understand that the sample size needs to be scaled for properly realizing the statistical significance of the obtained result from the Spearman correlation. The uniqueness is understood from the formulation that considers the personal (individual’s) perception during ranking of alternatives. Figure 3a shows the correlation value along with the 𝑝 value for the correlation between rank values. Clearly, readers infer that the result is statistically insignificant to realize the uniqueness of model. This further infers that the data/sample size is small to gain adequate inference. So, a simulation of 100 decision matrices is done each of order 20×6. Now, ranking order from each method is determined as explained earlier for each matrix. Average of the correlation coefficient values along with the 𝑝 values is determined and they are plotted in Fig. 3b. This clearly showcases the uniqueness of the proposed work along with a statistically significant standpoint to the result at 95% confidence that is obtained. So, it may be concluded that the proposed model follows a novel formulation of considering personalized ranking based on DE’s data.

Certain limitations of the proposed model are (i) values in the matrices are considered to be complete and imputation of missing values is ignored and (ii) experts need to be trained with the priority order for operative usage in MCDM.

Conclusion
This paper puts forward a novel decision model with integrated approaches under PHFS setting for rational MCDM. Core motivation for the study was gained from the idea of promoting personal perception of experts that is lacking in existing models under PHFS. To this end, weights of experts and criteria are methodically determined by proposing entropy measure and regret/rejoice factor with PHFEs. These approaches reflect the hesitation during preference elucidation and aids rational calculation. Further, REs are ranked by considering the personal perception of experts and finally a holistic ranking order is obtained by aggregating the rank values from experts. During the course of aggregation, interdependencies among criteria are effectively captured that intuitively supports rational selection. From Figs. 2 and  3, it is marked that the introduced work is robust against experts’ weight change and moderately consistent with other methods.

Certain managerial implications are (i) the proposed model is a ready to deploy tool for effective decision-making; (ii) the model considers personal perception of experts during ranking that is intuitive and rational; (iii) the model expects some trained experts for effective data sharing and inference gaining; and (iv) finally, the proposed work reduces human intervention by calculating parameters methodically and providing better scope for handling uncertainty.

As a future direction for research, the limitations of the model can be addressed. Further, models with partial weight information can be developed for MCDM and finally, machine learning concepts can be integrated with the model to promote learning-based decision-making.
