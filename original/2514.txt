Introduction
Background
Since the 14th has continued to deepen, private enterprises have grown stronger, more and more small have sprung up SMEs have developed into promoting our country’s national economic growth. However, because defects such as high risk, poor information transparency, lack of standardization in management, and low creditworthiness, it is very difficult for them to obtain financing in the society and the market. This has also become an impact on the further.

Significance
Optimization of hyperplane and support vector machine is mainly based on solving the main credit risks of small and medium-sized enterprises, such as poor information transparency, low credit and various risk unknown factors. BP neural network is an algorithm that integrates the components of supply chain financial financing. This article aims to study the, use this algorithm to establish a credit risk assessment model for small and medium-sized enterprises to explore the financing problems of small and medium-sized enterprises. The regression data model used in this research measures the credit risk of small and medium-sized enterprises. For example, the credit analysis of an enterprise, the risk assessment established by the potential financing of employees and customers can analyze the risk indicators of this experiment, government intervention and other factors.

Innovation
The innovations of this paper: (1) and studying the financing dilemma enterprises is of great significance to promote the further development. This difference exists current development status of SMEs, high financing risks, risk transparency, and future development prospects. Therefore, specific problems are analyzed in the experimental part. This includes the application of BP algorithm, re-export trade and value-added services established. (2) This article proposes to use SVM and BP neural network algorithm to build. SVM algorithm and BP neural network algorithm have the characteristics of fast convergence speed and excellent robust performance, which is conducive to the construction of this model.

Related work
Enterprise risks include competition risks, industrial risks, and other aspects. The assessment of enterprise risk and the equipment chain such as inventory and marketing are later marketing factors. Has received extensive attention at present, and has certain reference value for the research of this article. The society pays very high attention to SMEs, and there are not few related researches on them. Zheng Zhi and Huang Xianjun pointed out that financing difficulties are a problem that plagues SMEs. Many commercial banks have developed payment models and developed loan models together with regulatory agencies. Inventory is mainly the financing report made by post-search management. These links link up the payment model and the loan model, making it easier to manage and share information. At the same time, they also stated that high-quality products have the greatest value to the enterprise in the SME performance evaluation system that develops the fund transfer model. Employees’ work and performance indicators and cost indicators also have important benefits. Improve the business potential of their employees, give play to the characteristics of “small, fast, and flexible”, and continuously improve their performance [1]. Ji Xinlong and He Shu stated that current capital market can effectively alleviate the financing difficulties of private enterprises. This method has attracted more and more attention from commercial banks and private enterprises. They pointed out that commercial banks need to focus on financial sector reforms in order to use the financial chain to solve financial problems in the private sector. Private enterprises should actively integrate into the financial service platform, and the government should take a variety of measures to support the development of financial chain equipment [2]. In addition, Shen Aizhong, Guo Jinli, Suo Qi and others used multi-layer network theory as the basis, and regarded enterprises as nodes and the relationships between enterprises as interconnections. Models of financial evolution and attempts to fund new supply chain research methods. They obtained the cumulative steady-state average distribution of the supply chain financial network through mathematical analysis, and analyzed the results using computer simulations [3]. Based on the above research, we can see that the problem of financing dilemmas for SMEs has been around for a long time, but it seems that there is still no effective solution. Therefore, this article attempts to build the credit of SMEs under supply chain finance by using SVM and BP neural network algorithms. Risk assessment model, find out the main factors that affect the financing difficulties of SMEs, and propose some solutions to this.

Credit risk assessment of small and medium-sized enterprises under supply chain finance based on SVM and BP neural network
Content and methods
This article first collects a lot of information using literature research methods, and introduces in detail the theories related to SVM and BP neural network algorithms, explained and elaborated the supply chain model and the credit risk of SMEs, such as the credit analysis of an enterprise, the potential financing methods of employees and customers, the development plan of the enterprise, and the development prospects.

SVM algorithm
(1)
SVM theory

SVM, the full name is a support vector network, is a model of learning management and related computer learning algorithm, using partition analysis and retrieval for data analysis. In this algorithm, two types of samples should be divided and the isolation distance should be increased as much as possible. This is the basic question of SVM [4, 5]. According to the differences between the risk issues faced by the two types of enterprises, the influence of different factors such as credit transparency, and the development prospects of enterprises, data retrieval technology is used to compare the influence of private enterprises and commercial banks to establish a risk assessment model.

SVM algorithm flow

Suppose (𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑖),𝑖=1,2,……,𝑛,𝑥∈𝑅𝑑 is a sample data set, 𝑥𝑖 is the input data, and 𝑦∈{1,−1} is the output data, representing two categories. Divide the 𝑛 sample data into two categories, and maximize the separation distance [6]. First, the classification line must satisfy the formula (1):

𝑦𝑖=[(𝑤∙𝑥𝑖)+𝑏]−1≥0,𝑖=1,2,……,𝑛
(1)
In the formula, 𝑤 represents the normal of the classification hyperplane, which is the weight vector, 𝑏 represents the position relative to the origin, 𝑔(𝑥) represents the optimal hyperplane, and there is 𝑔(𝑥)=𝑤∙𝑥+𝑏=0.

Constrained optimization conditions can be derived from the optimal hyperplane:

minΦ(𝑤)=min𝑤,𝑏12‖𝑤‖2=min𝑤,𝑏12(𝑤,𝑤)
(2)
𝑦𝑖[(𝑤⋅𝑥𝑖)+𝑏]−1≥0,𝑖=1,2,……,𝑚
(3)
Introduce the Lagrangian function:

𝐿(𝑤,𝑏,𝑎)=12(𝑤⋅𝑤)−∑𝑖=1𝑛𝑎𝑖{𝑦𝑖[(𝑤⋅𝑥𝑖)+𝑏]−1}
(4)
In the formula, 𝐿(𝑤,𝑏,𝑎) means seeking partial derivative with respect to 𝑤,𝑏,𝑎, transforming the optimal classification problem into a dual partial derivative problem:

𝑄(𝑎)=∑𝑖=1𝑛𝑎𝑖−12∑𝑖,𝑗=1𝑛𝑎𝑖𝑎𝑗𝑦𝑖𝑦𝑗(𝑥𝑖,𝑥𝑗)
(5)
⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪∑𝑖=1𝑛𝑦𝑖𝑎𝑖=0𝑎𝑖≥0,𝑖=1,2,……,𝑛
(6)
If 𝑎𝑖 is the optimal solution, then

𝑤=∑𝑖=1𝑛𝑎𝑖𝑦𝑖𝑥𝑖
(7)
𝑏=1𝑦𝑠−𝑤⋅𝑥𝑠
(8)
In the formula, 𝑥𝑠 is any support vector, and the final optimal classification function is:

[(𝑤⋅𝑥)+𝑏]=sgn[∑𝑖=1𝑛𝑎𝑖𝑦𝑖(𝑥𝑖⋅𝑥)+𝑏]
(9)
(3)
Advantages of SVM algorithm

First, by it you can manage the learning process easily. Because the SVM algorithm is for learning with limited samples, it has a general average power. Optimizing the hyperplane refers to the establishment of a linear equation in a two-dimensional space. The application of this part of the method is to establish a direct relationship between the credit risk of the enterprise and the financing factors; the Lagrangian function is a function for seeking extreme values. Here, the application of the office is to minimize the factors that affect financing.

Second, for linearly inseparable problems, the SVM algorithm can convert low-dimensional linearly inseparable problems into problems that can be linearly decomposed into a space conducive to height.

Fourth, the SVM algorithm can achieve the global optimal solution [7, 8].

BP neural network algorithm
(1)
Artificial neural network

Human brain and the function of nerve cell organization. It is composed of many simple processing modules, similar to connected biological neurons, which can learn to acquire knowledge and solve problems. Neural networks have many algorithms and models. Most common feedback neural network is BP neural network [9, 10].

(2)
BP neural network algorithm principle

The article inputs all relevant data about SME financing into the input layer, summarizes the weight values according to the content of each aspect, and then outputs each data node. Nun network algorithm is also called reverse error algorithm. The main idea in the form of smaller squares, the principle is to replace the protruding layer [11]. Due to common errors, changes in network densities will not pass to the nearest hidden layer. Due to the reverse order, it is called backward propagation [12, 13].

(3)
BP neural network algorithm flow

First, input the sample data, set (𝑥1,𝑥2,……,𝑥𝑛), and calculate the actual output:

𝑦𝑖=1/[1+exp(−∑𝑖=1𝑛𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑥𝑖)]
(10)
𝑛 represents input and output nodes, 𝑖,𝑗 represents, and 𝑤𝑖𝑗 represents weight between the 𝑖 node and the 𝑗 node. Parameters of the 𝑘 layer, there are

𝑤𝑖𝑗(𝑘+1)=𝑤𝑖𝑗(𝑘)+𝜂𝜎𝑗𝑥𝑖+𝛼⌊𝑤𝑖𝑗(𝑘)−𝑤𝑖𝑗(𝑘−1)⌋
(11)
In the formula, 𝑥𝑖 represents input, 𝜂 represents learning coefficient, 𝛼 represents the impulse coefficient, 𝑗 node in the 𝑘−1 layer. There are output nodes:

𝜎𝑗=𝑦𝑗(1−𝑦𝑗)(𝑑𝑗−𝑦𝑗)
(12)
In the formula, 𝑦𝑗 and 𝑑𝑗, respectively, represent the actual output and expected output of the 𝑗 node.

The nodes of the hidden layer are calculated by reverse calculation:

𝜎𝑗=𝑥𝑗(1−𝑥𝑗)∑𝑖=0𝑚𝜎𝑗𝑤𝑖𝑗
(13)
In the formula, 𝑥𝑗 represents the actual output result of node 𝑗.

(4)
Advantages of BP neural network

BP physical network does not have to rely on scientific knowledge, but it can learn and learn a certain amount of sample data to find the internal connection between input and output and find a way, inventory and the equipment chain are later marketing factors. For the initial financing of the company, only the transparency of the company’s credit and the development prospects need to be observed. Therefore, certain data may not be considered. Among them, the application of risk assessment is established. Regression models are very valuable.

Second, it can handle nonlinear system problems well.

Third, it has strong applicability. BP neural network does not require variables to meet a specific distribution, which makes it more applicable in practice.

Fourth, it has strong fault tolerance and can denoise incomplete or incorrect data [14, 15].

Supply chain finance model
(1)
The connotation of supply chain finance

New type of corporate financing. Commercial transactions with core companies in the chain as the financing objects, and uses scientific and reasonable methods social production methods, market competition has transformed into competition among multiple supply chains [16, 17].

(2)
The model of supply chain finance

The first is the financing model of pledged accounts receivable. In the course of business operations, the amount payable by the purchaser is the company’s accounts receivable because it sells goods or products or provides labor and services. This is a kind of bond to some extent. The account receivable pledge financing or transfer the accounts receivable generated during commercial transactions to financial institutions, generally commercial banks, to apply for credit to them, and then return them when the company obtains the returned funds loan. Generally speaking, due to their small scale and slow capital turnover, it is common for SMEs to obtain financing support from commercial banks in this way.

The second is the financing mode of financing warehouses. This financing method introduces logistics companies into a kind of inventory guarantee. In the transaction process, small and medium-sized enterprises mortgage the purchased materials or products to the financial warehouse opened by the logistics company, and the consignment logistics company will handle it on their behalf.

The third is the financing mode of bonded warehouses. Bonded warehouse financing can be understood as future inventory financing. In the supply chain, SMEs always need to provide external suppliers with advance payments to obtain raw materials for continuous operations. Accordingly, linked stores provide loans to SMEs with insufficient tax conversion. This is not a single application basis. This approach is that SMEs must first commit to repurchase from upstream suppliers. Suppliers use warehouses designated by commercial banks as pledges [18].

(3)
Characteristics of supply chain finance

Second, it has trade self-compensation. After providing financing to SMEs, commercial banks will monitor the goods and services of SMEs in real time. The income from products sold by SMEs is the direct source of bank financing and repayment.

Third, compared with traditional credit business, supply chain finance is a complete system, which serves all enterprises and entities in the chain, rather than a single enterprise. It breaks through the buyer–seller-based trade pattern formed by the traditional financing model, integrates financial institutions, core companies, financing companies, and logistics companies into a whole, reducing the risks of both borrowers and lenders in the traditional financing model [19].

Credit risk assessment of SMEs
(1)
Reasons for credit risk

1)
The impact of national macro policy regulation. In order to maintain the stable operation of our country’s economy, the government sometimes intervenes and adjusts the market economy and introduces some economic policies, which will affect the credit risk of SMEs to a certain extent [20].

2)
Internal factors of SMEs

Most SMEs are small in scale, and their internal management has not formed a systematic and complete mechanism, and their management and operation capabilities are not perfect. In most cases, they can only rely on a single enterprise entity to invest. Managers also lack effective decision-making procedures, which are easy to appear. Under these conditions, small and medium-sized enterprises will have credit risk problems. In addition, their financial information is not transparent enough, and there are often incidents of lack of credit, leading to low creditworthiness among financial lending institutions [21].

3)
Information asymmetry between banks and enterprises. According to the experimental data and the existing SME financing development status, it is inferred that some SMEs use illegal means to obtain bank loans for speculation, which further amplifies their moral hazard and credit risk. This will have an impact on the reputation of the company. For their own interests, banks will reduce loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, which further aggravates the financing difficulties [22].

(2)
Classification of credit risk

Mainly divided into the following categories:

1)
Environmental risks, including natural disasters such as earthquakes, droughts and floods, and typhoons.

2)
Political risk. Affected by national economic policies, the credit risk of SMEs will also be affected to a certain extent.

3)
Logistics risks are mainly manifested in emergencies such as damage, stolen, lost or vehicle accidents that occur during the handling and loading and unloading of products and raw materials.

4)
Cooperation risk. There are multiple subjects in supply chain finance. Small and medium-sized enterprises have a cooperative relationship with each other. Because the business philosophy and strategic goals of each enterprise are different, once the two parties conflict, each enterprise in the chain will lose the right Trust, which will also lead to the disruption of the supply chain.

5)
Market demand is too large, the company will inevitably expand production, and upstream suppliers are likely to be unable to supply in time and reduce product quality. The problem; and if the supply is greater than the market demand, consumer loyalty decreases, and the demand for products decreases, then it will affect the company’s capital chain flow.

6)
Information risk. Generally, the interests of all parties in the supply chain are related to each other. If the information is not shared in time or is incorrectly communicated, it will have a huge impact on the entire supply chain.

(3)
Principles for selecting SME credit risk assessment indicators

1)
Comprehensiveness. Supply chain finance involves multiple entities, including suppliers, financial institutions, core enterprises, and logistics companies. When selecting SME credit risk assessment indicators and constructing SME credit risk assessment models, various factors must be considered comprehensively. Taking into account all factors that affect credit risk, the credit status of SMEs can be initially comprehensively evaluated.

2)
Be targeted. The selection of indicators should proceed from the entire supply chain, adopt different solutions to the various factors affecting credit risk, comprehensively consider the relationship between the elements, and constantly adjust the evaluation index system to make the evaluation model have a certain pertinence.

3)
The level and structure distribution of the index system should be reasonable. The evaluation model should follow the principle at each level should be focused as much as possible, while avoiding being too complicated and absolute. Try to achieve a reasonable structure and focus.

4)
The selected indicators should be easy to operate. When selecting indicators, try to choose easy-to-operate indicators and avoid selecting indicators that are not easy to collect and obtain and are complex and heavy to calculate.

Construction of credit risk assessment model for small and medium-sized enterprises in supply chain finance based on SVM and BP neural network
Establishment of credit risk assessment index system for SMEs
We will select and set an index for the assessment of SME credit risk under the supply chain budget. These six types of credit risks include external and internal risks such as competition risk, financial risk, personnel risk, production and operation, and enterprise risk assessment. Different companies have different risk impacts, so there is no need to sort them and they have to be discussed based on actual condition. Set the credit risk evaluation index as 𝑅, and divide the six types of credit risks. The specific content is shown in Table 1.

Table 1 Credit risk assessment index system for SMEs
Full size table
Assessment indicator system, through the scientific theoretical guidance of the system, it can truly reflect the credit risk assessment status, we have constructed a credit risk indicator system with 6 primary indicators and 12 secondary indicators as evaluation targets.

Methodology
To ensure the smooth progress of the test, we randomly selected 15 test sample data source. Normalized situation will be discussed in the fourth part. Since the original sample data we have is incomplete or incomplete or incorrect, all sample data to [0.1] to minimize the impact on the model. There will be errors in the digital initialization phase of the data. Risk itself is an uncertain word. The optimization of the data is based on the most powerful data conversion modeling after the normalization of the sample data.

1)
Maximum minimum method expression is

𝑥′=(𝑥𝑘−𝑥min)/(𝑥max−𝑥min)
(14)
2)
The function expression of the mean variance method is

𝑥′=(𝑥𝑘−𝑥𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛)/𝑥var
(15)
In the formula, 𝑥𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 represents value.

Other normalization processing expressions are:

𝑦=⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪1𝑥−𝑥min𝑥max−𝑥min0𝑥≥𝑥max𝑥min≤𝑥≤𝑥max𝑥≤𝑥min
(16)
In the formula, 𝑦 represents the normalized standard value of the data, 𝑥 is the actual value of each index data.

The normalized sample data, we first make a prediction and assessment of the credit risk of SMEs. The prediction standard is shown in Table 2. 0–0.20 is defined as very safe and no credit risk; 0.21–0.40 is relatively safe; 0.41–0.60 is a normal risk and can be controlled; 0.61–0.80 is a higher risk; 0.81–1.00 is a very high risk.

Training results of sample data

Substituting the first 10 sets of training sample data into the network model for repeated training, recording the actual output and expected output each time, and calculating the absolute and relative error values of the training samples. The results are shown in Table 4 and Fig. 3.

As shown in Table 4 and Fig. 3, nonlinear mapping ability and learning ability are data evaluations corresponding to the risks. The nonlinear mapping capability here is to use three methods to obtain the number of three hidden layers, find the minimum and maximum, and then verify the model prediction error one by one from the minimum until the maximum is reached. Finally, the number of hidden layers with the smallest model error is selected. The data values evaluated by experts are combined to determine the expected output value of the experiment. This step confirms the feasibility of expert evaluation, which indicates that the output value of the uncompressed SME credit model is close to the expert estimate.

(4)
Test results of sample data

The following five sets of test sample data are input into the trained model to further test the effectiveness of the model. The results are shown in Table 5 and Fig. 4.

As shown in Table 5, the maximum relative error of the sample test output is 0.02402%, which is less than 0.1%. In Fig. 4, the actual output is compared with the expected output to obtain the area diagram, and it can be seen that there is not much difference between the two. Therefore, it can be considered that the SME generalization capabilities, and can make a more accurate and effective assessment of the credit risk of SMEs.

Model checking
We calculated the weight value of each level of the index with the trained model, and used the SVM algorithm to perform classification calculation and regression analysis on each level of index. And compare the expert scoring results to test the practicality of the model. The results are shown in Figs. 5 and 6.

Coefficient of variation scored by experts on various risk indicators

Full size image
According to the data in Fig. 5, among the experts’ ratings of various risk indicators, R21 and R42 have the highest frequency, which is 8, followed by R51, which is 7. This shows that government involvement, market demand, and the sharing of information between the top and bottom elements. R61 is the largest, which is 4.63, followed by R12 and R62, which are 4.58 and 4.55, respectively; among the standard deviation values, the R51 has the largest error, and the R11 has the smallest error. The standard deviation can reflect the degree of dispersion of a data set. In order to differentiate the various risk indicators to obtain a reliable evaluation value, it is very meaningful. Take market demand as an example. Only by understanding these indicators are the age and income of the population, the economic profile of the area, the living habits of the citizens, the consumption patterns of consumers, the ability and desire to buy products, and the degree of competition among the same industry in the area. After the specific value of, the average value and standard deviation can be used to maximize market demand. The purpose of analyzing the average value and standard deviation of various risk indicators is to minimize the risks of government intervention, market demand, and various data nodes, and make corresponding adjustments to analyze the structure of corporate financing risks.

As shown in Fig. 6, among the 12 credit risk indicators, R41 has the largest coefficient of variation, reaching 30.14%, followed by R21, which is 28.19%, and R62 and R51 have the smallest coefficient of variation, only 12.34% and 14.02%. This shows that the government’s economic policies and the product quality of small and medium-sized enterprises have a large impact on their credit risk.

The relative error result of the analytic hierarchy process

Full size image
It can be seen from Fig. 7 that the analytic hierarchy process is used to analyze and detect the training samples. The calculated credit risk ratio is between 0.09–0.95, the teacher value is between 0.14–0.97, and the absolute error is between 0.03–0.91. In terms of credit risk, the maximum value is 0.95, the minimum value is 0.09, and the average value of 10 training results 0.535; the average value of the 10 training results is 0.595; the maximum absolute error is 0.74, and the minimum value is 0.39, and the average of the 10 training results is 0.611. These three values are relatively concentrated. As shown in Fig. 8, the maximum correlation error between the amount of credit risk calculated by the algorithm and the custodian value reached 59.14%, and the minimum was 6.28%; the maximum relative error of the algorithm in this paper is only 0.02402%, which illustrates the practicality of learning factors in coordination; in addition, the model algorithm also proves the authenticity of the data obtained in the process of different analysis levels.

Conclusions
With the continuous deepening of our country’s economic system reform and the continuous optimization and improvement of the economic structure of multiple ownership systems. Due to their level of control and financial constraints, they have low credit in many commercial banks and other financial institutions, fall into financial difficulties, and hinder their further development. In addition to the factors that affect the development of enterprises, there are six major influencing factors such as external political environmental factors, but this article only focuses on the progress of risk financing caused by the shortcomings of SMEs, using multiple sets of data to repeatedly verify In order to obtain the economic structure optimization process of multiple economic systems.

Force that cannot be underestimated in promoting the growth of our national economy. Therefore, this paper proposes to use SVM and BP neural network algorithm to build a model.

In this study, the results of the SME credit risk assessment data index are analyzed. Under normal risk, the value is 0.41–0.60, and the maximum error value of the analytic hierarchy process is 0.024%. In terms of supply and demand risk, error value index of any aspect of the enterprise, and design the generation and marketing of evasive products. Using the analytic hierarchy process to test the sample data, it is calculated that the maximum relative error is 59.14% and the minimum is 6.28%, which confirms the superiority of the SVM and BP neural network algorithms in this article. However, due to limited time and resources, the research in this article is not thorough enough, and the analysis of related issues is not thorough enough, and further improvement is needed.

This research discusses the various factors affecting and uses a variety of methods such as regression models, decision trees, and comparative analysis to analyze with big data. Put forward constructive suggestions.
