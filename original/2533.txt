This paper is concerned about the characteristics of the dual solutions of an unsteady stagnation-point flow of a hybrid nanofluid over a rotating disk with the effect of Hall current. The governing equations are non-dimensionalized using the appropriate similarity transformations. The resulting equations are solved numerically by employing the bvp4c method. A comparison between the present solutions with the available solutions is presented which shows an excellent agreement. The solution exists in the upper branch for all values of the hybrid nanofluid ùúô1,ùúô2, the swirl parameter Œ©ùê¥, and impinging parameter ùõΩùê¥. However, the breakdown is observed in the lower branch solution at some moderate values of ùõΩùê¥. In addition, the radial velocity increases due to hybrid nanofluid, while the azimuthal velocity decreases. However, the temperature increases due to hybrid nanofluid. Moreover, the results also indicate that the swirl parameter augments the velocity in both directions but declines the temperature. Also, it is perceived that the azimuthal velocity and temperature decrease in the upper branch solution as the magnetic parameter increases, while the lower branch solution initially increases and then decreases for the transverse component of velocity but the temperature monotonically increases.

Introduction
The flow induced by a rotating disk has vital role in many engineering and industrial applications for example in wastewater treatment, turbo-machinery, rotating blades, devices of computer storage, flight mechanics, processing of food, rotor‚Äìstator system, geothermal extraction, chemical mixing chambers, process of oil recovery, and power generators. The flow and heat transport characteristics of a non-Newtonian liquid over a steadily revolving disk have been investigated by Sahoo et al. [1]. Due to the substantial impact of the magnetic field on the flow, Kumar et al. [2] examined the flow through a permeable rotating disk. Alternatively, Munawar et al. [3] studied the behavior of multiple solutions of a pure fluid flow over a rotating disk subjected to time-dependent impinging on the free stream. Mentioning the importance of rotating disks in a gas turbine, Frusteri and Osalusi [4] examined the magnetic flow on a rotating disk. Attia [5] studied the influences of Lorentz force, ion slip, and Ohmic heating on the steady flow above a rotating disk. Turkyilmazoglu [6] developed exact solutions of a magnetic fluid flow over a steadily porous rotating disk with viscous dissipation and Joule heating effects. An extension of this study has been done considering the heat and mass transfer with variable thermophysical properties [7]. Hayat et al. [8] examined the impacts of viscous dissipation on the flow of nanofluid induced by rotating disk with Joule heating. It is reported that the heat transport decelerates with a stronger magnetic field. The entropy generation of a magnetohydrodynamic flow over a rotating variable thickness disk by considering the radiation effect, viscous dissipation, and Joule heating was investigated by Hayat et al. [9]. Raza et al. [10] scrutinized the steady flow induced by Williamson fluid through stretchable curves sheet with radiation effect. Recently, Ahmed et al. [11] investigated the advancement of thin fluid films on a rotating disk by involving the effects of erratic magnetic field, nonlinear radiation, and Joule heating.

In many engineering applications, considerable heat transfer enhancement is still required to improve thermal performance. In this regard, Choi [12] first introduced a mixture of pure fluid and nanoparticles termed nanofluid. Usually, nanofluids provide better heat transfer rate than the regular fluids. Loganayagi and Kameswaran [13] examined the flow and heat transport of a nanofluid flow over a rotating disk with velocity slip, magnetic field, and Hall current. Results revealed that the heat transport diminishes for a higher volume fraction of nanoparticles. In recent days, researchers have attempted to augment the heat transfer of nanofluids by scattering dissimilar kinds of homogenous nanoparticles into a regular fluid. In recent times, the irregular magnetic effect on the peristaltic flow induced by non-Newtonian fluid through nanoparticles and microorganisms via two infinite coaxial conduits was examined by Abdelsalam and Bhatti [14]. Abdelsalam and Sohail [15] addressed the transport phenomena of heat and mass transfer by investigating a 3D Darcy-Forchheimer flow analysis induced by micro-organisms and nanoparticles past an erratic stretchable surface with a magnetic field. Abumandour et al. [16] investigated the thermal viscosity effect on magneto peristalsis flow induced by nanofluid from a vertical resilient pipe. They have shown that the pressure gradient can be controlled by the thermal viscosity parameter. Akram et al. [17] investigated the influence of magnetic effect on the peristaltic flow of nanofluid induced by tapered channel with half-breed effect. Akram et al. [18] scrutinized the second velocity slip model on the peristaltic flow induced by non-Newtonian nanofluid with double diffusivity. Afzal et al. [19, 20] addressed the impact of double diffusivity on the peristaltic flow induced by non-Newtonian nanofluids in tapered and nonuniform channels, respectively. Recently, Akram et al. [21,22,23] investigated the peristaltic flow induced by nanofluid with different aspects. On the other hand, hybrid nanofluids are advanced and novel kinds of nanofluids that have superior thermal effectiveness compared to regular nanofluids. Hybrid nanofluids are produced by scattering two or more distinct kinds of nanoparticles in the medium of regular fluid. The challenges and future applications of hybrid nanofluids have been reviewed and noted in the studies [24,25,26,27,28]. The impact of EMHD on blood flow with aid of electro-osmotic forces through arteries induced by second-grade hybrid fractional nanofluid was inspected by Abdelsalam et al. [29]. The flow and characteristics of heat transport of various nanofluids over a rotating disk have been studied by Turkyilmazoglu [30]. They accounted that the nanoliquid improved the heat transfer in comparison to the carrier fluid. Later, Tassaddiq et al. [31] extended the model of Turkyilmazoglu for the hybrid nanofluid including the influence of the magnetic field. It has been recognized that the HN is better in heat transport compared to the regular fluid.

In order to improve the heat transfer of the regular fluid, Ahmadian et al. [32] analyzed the HN flow over a wavy rotating disk. They found that the hybrid nanofluid significantly augments the thermal performance of the base fluid. Khan et al. [33] examined the time-dependent hybrid nanofluid flow about a rotating disk with the influences of Hall current, heat dissipation, magnetic field as well as thermal radiation. The rate of heat transport for hybrid nanoliquid is identified to be superior compared to that of nanoliquid. Ouyang et al. [34] studied the influences of thermal radiation and magnetic field on the flow with heat transport of a hybrid nanoliquid over a stretchable spinning disk. Sadaf and Abdelsalam [35] presented the physical features of a 2D flow induced by a hybrid nanofluid through an irregular annulus with flexible boundaries incorporated by the mechanism of the mixed convective model. On the other hand, Shoaib et al. [36] considered the magnetohydrodynamic HN over a rotating disk with the effects of Hall current, magnetic field, heat dissipation, and thermal radiation.

The influence of Hall current plays a significant role in the fields of medical and engineering sciences. Applications in engineering include dynamics of cosmological fluid, geophysics, and Hall accelerator, while in medical science, Hall current utilized in ECG, cardiac MRI, etc. Cowling [37] observed that when greater values of the magnetic field are utilized, it needs Ohm‚Äôs law to incorporate the Hall currents. The Hall current impact in magnetohydrodynamic boundary-layer flow from a semi-infinite plate was examined by Katagiri [38]. The characteristics of time-dependent viscous rotating flow were explored by Debnath et al. [39]. The impact of Hall current on the peristaltic 2D flow induced by Maxwell fluid through permeable walls saturated in a porous medium with the magnetic field was inspected by Koumy et al. [40]. Prasad et al. [41] inspected the features of Hall current for the stream moving over an erratic thicker sheet. Mabood et al. [42] scrutinized the hydro-magnetic flow passing from a spinning channel in a nanofluid. Bhatti and Abdelsalam [43] analyzed the impact of entropy on magnetohydrodynamic dusty fluid under the slip effect incorporated by a peristaltic wave saturated in a permeable channel.

The above literature review indicates that the hybrid nanofluid is of great practical importance in many industrial applications owing to its higher thermal performance than a regular heat transfer fluid. Although the unsteady characteristic could cause unwanted damage in a device, however, no study has attempted to uncover the critical conditions like boundary layer separation of the hybrid nanoliquid flow over a spinning disk. So, the intend of the present study is to expose the flow and heat transfer features with a demarcation of boundary layer separation of an unsteady hybrid nanofluid flow over a spinning disk in the presence of Hall current. Numerical solutions of the dimensionless governing equations are illustrated with the flow properties and streamlines in the context of dual solutions.

Mathematical background of the spinning disk problem
Let us consider the flow configuration of the given axonometric model and coordinate system along with the water-based Ag‚ÄìTiO2 hybrid nanofluid as schematically shown in Fig. 1. The unsteady, incompressible and viscous flow of water-based Ag‚ÄìTiO2 hybrid nanofluid over a portable spinning disk (SPD) is considered, along with the significant impacts of stagnation-point flow and Hall current. The non-conducting SPD is located at ùëß=ùêª=ùúàùëì(1‚àíùõæ1ùë°)/ùëê‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚àö and encroaches the forthcoming hybrid nanofluid with a variable velocity (function of time) ùëäùê¥=ùêª‚Ä≤(ùë°) in corresponding to the positive ùëß‚àí direction. The mathematical symbols such as ùëê,ùúàùëì and ùõæ1 correspond to the inviscid velocity, the kinematic viscosity of the regular base fluid and the characteristic constraint with dimension (1/ùë°) and ùõæ1ùë°<1, respectively. The hybrid nanofluid in the neighborhood of the stagnation-point is flowing with a variable time-dependent velocity such as ùë¢‚àû=ùëêùëü/1‚àíùõæ1ùë°. Additionally, the non-conducting disk is revolving about its coordinate axis ùëü=0 with variable angular velocity Œ©=Œ©0/(1‚àíùõæ1ùë°), where positive arbitrary constants Œ©0 is the corresponding steady-state angular velocity and ùë° is the time. A uniform variable or time-dependent magnetic field ùêµ=ùêµ0/1‚àíùõæ1ùë°‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚àö is applied normal to the non-conducting SPD, where ùêµ0 is the strength of the corresponding magnetic field. The surface temperature of the rotating disk and the ambient temperature from it are signified by ùëáùë§ and ùëá‚àû, respectively. The thermophysical properties of the Ag (silver) nanoparticles and TiO2 (titanium dioxide nanoparticles) along with the base fluid water (H2O) are in thermal equilibrium. Also, here we assume the axisymmetric flow and the corresponding cylindrical coordinates (ùëü,ùúÉ,ùëß) and change with respect to ùúÉ vanishes. On behalf of the above-indicated proviso, the constitutive governing equations are demarcated as follows [3, 33, 44]:

Model and the thermo-physical features of the hybrid nanofluid
In this subsection, we discuss the details of the considered water-based Ag‚ÄìTiO2 hybrid nanofluid. The hybrid nanofluid essentially designates the mixture of two distinct nanoparticles silver (Ag) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) along with the base fluid water (H2O). In regards to several published works specifically Khan et al. [45], Hayat et al. [46], and Takabi and Salehi [47], they have bounded the upcoming constitutive governing equations along with the considered thermo-physical features of the hybrid nanofluid which attained the flow characteristics accurately.

The similarity transformations and dimensionless equations of the problem
This section is devoted to explain the conversion procedure of our given axonometric model into the appropriate dimensionless form. For utilizing this process, here we start by letting the following similarity transformations:

‚éß‚é©‚é®‚é™‚é™‚é™‚é™ùúì=ùëêùúàùëì1‚àíùõæ1ùë°‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚àöùëü2ùêπ(ùúç),ùúç=ùëßùêª(ùë°)‚àí1,ùëù=ùúáùëìùëüùë¢‚àûùëÉ(ùúç),ùë£=ùëêùëü1‚àíùõæ1ùë°ùê∫(ùúç),ùë¢=1ùëü‚àÇùúì‚àÇùëß=ùëêùëü1‚àíùõæ1ùë°ùêπ‚Ä≤(ùúç),ùë§=‚àí1ùëü‚àÇùúì‚àÇùëü=‚àí2ùëêùúàùëì1‚àíùõæ1ùë°‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚àöùêπ(ùúç),ùúÉ=ùëá‚àíùëá‚àûùëáùë§‚àíùëá‚àû,
(8)
where ùúì is the stream function, ùêπ‚Ä≤,ùê∫,ùëÉ and ùúÉ are the dimensionless radial and azimuthal velocities, the dimensionless pressure, and the dimensionless temperature, respectively, while the prime signifies the derivative with respect to the pseudo-similarity variable ùúç.

Now using the aforementioned transformations, Eq. (1) is truly satisfied while the governing Eqs. (1‚Äì7)reduce to the following set of dimensionless equations:

The transform boundary conditions are

where

ùúáHnf/ùúáùëì===ùúáùê¥,ùúåHnf/ùúåùëì=ùúåùê¥,ùëòHnf/ùëòùëìùëòùê¥,ùúéHnf/ùúéùëì=ùúéùê¥,(ùúåùëêùëù)Hnf/(ùúåùëêùëù)ùëì(ùúåùëêùëù)ùê¥.
The involved dimensionless parameters in the above Eqs. (9‚Äì13) are the magnetic parameter ùëÄùê¥=ùúéùëìùêµ20/ùúåùëìùëê, the Prandtl number Pr=ùúàùëì(ùúåùëêùëù)ùëì/ùëòùëì and the rotation parameter Œ©ùê¥=Œ©0/ùëê. In addition, the axial motion of the disk occurs due to the nonzero positive values of the impingement parameter which is mathematically denoted by ùõΩùê¥=ùõæ1/ùëê. Consequently, the non-conducting disk starts motion perpendicularly upward on the contrary direction of the oncoming flow due to the case of negative values of the impingement parameter ùõΩùê¥ which corresponds to ùëäùê¥>0, while the same considered problem reduces to the case of time-independent (steady) in the absence of the axial motion when ùõΩùê¥=0.

Further, applying the integration of both sides of Eq. (11) and utilizing the boundary stipulations (13), one gets the dimensionless pressure equation for the water-based Ag‚ÄìTiO2 hybrid nanofluid as follows:

ùëÉ(ùúç)ùúåùê¥‚àí2ùêπ2+ùõΩ2ùê¥8+2ùúáùê¥ùúåùê¥ùêπ‚Ä≤+ùõΩùê¥ùêπ‚àíùõΩ2ùê¥4+ùõΩùê¥ùúçùêπ=ùê∂.
(14)
The right-hand side of Eq. (14) involves the arbitrary constant ùê∂ which can be calculated by using (13) in (14), we acquire the value of arbitrary constant ùê∂=0. Thus, Eq. (14) for the pressure distribution takes the form

ùëÉ(ùúç)=ùúåùê¥(2ùêπ2(ùúç)‚àí2ùúáùê¥ùúåùê¥ùêπ‚Ä≤(ùúç)‚àí(1+ùúç)ùõΩùê¥ùêπ(ùúç)+ùõΩ2ùê¥8).
(15)
The gradients or engineering quantities
The current subsection demonstrates the engineering or physical quantities of interest which include the shear stress ùê∂Fr, the frictional torque ùê∂Gr, and the heat transfer Nuùëü which are mainly useable in engineering to design equipment at the nanoscale and also describe the behavior of the fluid flow through the solution domain.

These quantities are mathematically framed as follows:

‚éß‚é©‚é®‚é™‚é™ùê∂Fr=ùúèùë§1ùúåùëìùë¢2‚àû,ùê∂Gr=ùúèùë§2ùúåùëìùë¢2‚àû,Nuùëü=ùëüùëûùë§ùëòùëì(ùëáùë§‚àíùëá‚àû),ùúèùë§1=ùúáHnf‚àÇùë¢‚àÇùëß‚à£‚à£ùëß=ùêª(ùë°),ùúèùë§2=ùúáHnf‚àÇùë£‚àÇùëß‚à£‚à£ùëß=ùêª(ùë°),ùëûùë§=‚àíùëòHnf‚àÇùëá‚àÇùëß‚à£‚à£ùëß=ùêª(ùë°),
(16)
where ùúèùë§1 and ùúèùë§2 correspond to the shear stresses at the wall surface of the spinning disk and ùëûùë§ is the respective heat flux at the wall surface of the non-conducting disk. Now substituting Eqs. (8) into (16), we get the following reduced shear stress, reduced frictional torque, and reduced local Nusselt number.

The skin friction or shear stress at the surface of the spinning disk along the radial direction:

Reùëü‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚àöùê∂Fr=ùúáùê¥ùêπ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(0)

(18)
The heat transfer rate at the surface of the spinning disk:

Re‚àí1/2ùëüNuùëü=‚àíùëòùê¥ùúÉ‚Ä≤(0)
(19)
where the local Reynolds number is Reùëü=ùë¢‚àûùëüùúàùëì.

Numerical solution methodology of the considered scheme
This section demonstrates the dimensionless forms of the nonlinear ordinary differential Eqs. (ODE‚Äôs) (9‚Äì12) along with the appropriate boundary conditions (13), which are difficult to solve analytically. Hence, these Eqs. (9‚Äì12) are tackled numerically using a built-in function in MATLAB software such as bvp4c (Khan et al. [45] and Shampine et al. [52]), which is based on 3-Stage Lobatto IIIA formula and also a finite difference scheme to find their approximate two different solution branches. The mechanism of this method is working only in the case if the system of equations is in the first order of ODEs. Here, to continue the process, we need to change our dimensionless equations from higher-order into first order by letting the new variable as follows:

ùêπ==ùúâ1,ùêπ‚Ä≤=ùúâ2,ùêπ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤=ùúâ3,ùê∫=ùúâ4,ùê∫‚Ä≤ùúâ5,ùëÉ=ùúâ6,ùúÉ=ùúâ7,ùúÉ‚Ä≤=ùúâ8.
(20)
Now utilizing Eq. (20) into dimensionless Eqs. (9‚Äì12) along with boundary stipulations (13), we accomplish the following set of first-order ODEs:

Solving Eq. (21) along with the corresponding initial stipulations (22) requires initial guesses at the start of the mesh points and variations of length-size to accomplish the goals of accuracy of 10‚Äì6. In this regard, the considered scheme tries to set the computational accuracy in a consequence of size ùë• be less than 10‚àí6+10‚àí6ùë•. In addition, the current problem is numerically solved for the two different solution branches (solutions of the upper and lower branches). Therefore, it is required two different guesses for finding distinct branch outcomes. The upper branch outcome can be easily found due to an early obvious guess, while the guess needed for the lower branch is quite complicated. Hence, the guess selection for the lower branch requires more effort, to get the solutions which satisfy the boundary convergence asymptotically.

The validation of the considered numerical scheme
The presentation of this section depends upon the validation of the considered problem and the given methodology for both tabular and graphical forms. The two different solution branches (upper and lower branch solutions) for the boundary layer thickness of the given working scheme is numerically compared with the available work of Ref. [53] for the various values of the impingement parameter ùõΩùê¥ specifically for the case without the rotation parameter, nanoparticles volume fractions, Hall parameter, and magnetic parameter as shown in Table 3. Outcomes in the table demonstrate that the lower and upper branch solutions are in excellent matching which authenticates and confirms our numerical scheme. Further verification of the given algorithm, we have prepared the solution graph for the azimuthal velocity due to various values of the impingement parameter ùõΩùê¥ against the similarity variable ùúç in the absence of the constraints such as ùëÄùê¥=ùëö=ùúô1=ùúô2=0 when Œ©ùê¥=1.0 and are graphically highlighted in Fig. 2. The assessment verifies the excellent harmony between the current and reported graphical outcomes.

Results and discussion
Interpretation of the numerical solution domain
In this portion of work, our numerical scheme leads us to the following upper and lower solution branches for the dimensionless form of Eqs. (9‚Äì12) along with the boundary stipulations (13) which notice that diverse flow patterns may appear in certain spectrums of physical constraints ùõΩùê¥, Œ©ùê¥ and nanoparticles volume fraction ùúô1 and ùúô2. It is important to note that the two different branches‚Äô outcomes are mathematically sound and can be well-matched with the engineering, physics, and mechanics of the flow phenomena. The computational outcomes of the friction factor, ùúáùê¥ùêπ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(0), frictional torque, ùúáùê¥ùê∫‚Ä≤(0), and Nusselt number, ‚àíùëòùê¥ùúÉ‚Ä≤(0), of the water/Ag‚ÄìTiO2 HN are designed against the impingement parameter ùõΩùê¥, for the specified changing values of the rotation parameter Œ©ùê¥ (=1.0 and 2.0) are shown in Fig. 3a‚Äìf, respectively. The similarity solution for the water-based Ag‚ÄìTiO2 hybrid nanofluid exists for all negative choices of the impingement parameter ùõΩùê¥, for the situation of the upper branch when Œ©ùê¥=1.0 (see Fig. 3a‚Äìc). On the other hand, the existence of the similarity solution is completely terminating in the range of ‚àí2.4<ùõΩùê¥<‚àû, in the phenomenon of the lower branch solution, where a critical or bifurcation value at ùõΩùê¥=‚àí2.4. Moreover, the solution in the case of the lower branch is very less for the frictional torque (see Fig. 3b) as compared to the other two gradients (like ùúáùê¥ùêπ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(0) (see Fig. 3a) and ‚àíùëòùê¥ùúÉ‚Ä≤(0) (see Fig. 3c)) while more the outcomes for the ‚àíùëòùê¥ùúÉ‚Ä≤(0) in the case of the upper branch. From Fig. 3d‚Äìf, it is observed deeply that for the swirl parameter Œ©ùê¥=2.0, the outcome range for the unstable solution decreases, and the similarity outcome of the hybrid nanofluid is possible for the range ‚àí‚àû<ùõΩùê¥<‚àí2.4. Although, the graphical behavior in Fig. 3a‚Äìf illustrates that the critical or bifurcation value ùõΩùê¥ùê∂ as stated in Ref. [3] and [44] does not found for the considered flow problem which is maybe owing to the existence of the rotation or swirl parameter. In our present problem, for the case of ùõΩùê¥<0, the upper branch similarity solution of the hybrid nanofluid is possible while the solution of the lower branch does not survive due to the strong influence of the swirl parameter Œ©ùê¥, and further, the outcome domain decreases down as Œ©ùê¥ augments. At the start of the literature, it is already mentioned that the case of ùõΩùê¥<0 suggests to the motion of non-conducting disk in the upward direction. So, the existence of a similarity solution of the hybrid nanofluid is due to the phenomenon of the spinning disk as observable in the figures.

From Fig. 4a‚Äìf, it is similarly noticed that the behavior of the solution domain is the same as (Fig. 3a‚Äìf which will not be repeated here for the values of ùúô1=0.025 and ùúô2=0.035, respectively. Finally, in all figures, it is noticed that both branch solutions are very far away to cross each other except that for the rotation parameter Œ©ùê¥=2.0, (see Fig. 3e) upper and lower branch solutions of the frictional torque are closer to touch or cross each other at approximately, ùõΩùê¥=‚àí2.5678, where ùúáùê¥ùê∫‚Ä≤(0)=‚àí1.6547, but, the identity or uniqueness of the upper and lower solution branches does not annihilate.

In addition, the behavior of the fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics can be more easily and clearly observed via the tabular forms. Therefore, Tables 4, 5 and 6 are constructed to illustrate the numerical outcomes of the skin friction coefficient, ùúáùê¥ùêπ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(0), frictional torque, ùúáùê¥ùê∫‚Ä≤(0), and heat transfer, ‚àíùëòùê¥ùúÉ‚Ä≤(0) for the upper and lower branch solutions with the influence of Œ©ùê¥, ùëÄùê¥, ùúô1 and ùúô2 when ùëö=0.5, ùõΩùê¥=‚àí2.0 and Pr=6.2. The outcomes recognize that the shear stress at the surface of the spinning disk along the radial direction upsurges for the upper branch with higher values of ùúô1,ùúô2, Œ©ùê¥ and ùëÄùê¥ while the impacts of ùëÄùê¥ is same for lower branch but it is reduces significantly for lower branch because of Œ©ùê¥, ùúô1 and ùúô2. On the other hand, the magnitude of the frictional torque at the surface of the spinning disk along azimuthal direction upsurges for the upper branch and reduces for the lower branch due to the hybrid nanoparticles, while the magnitude of the frictional torque is monotonically elevates for both branch solutions with larger values of ùëÄùê¥ and Œ©ùê¥. Moreover, the heat transfer rises for the upper branch solution but declines for the lower branch due to the higher response values of ùëÄùê¥ and Œ©ùê¥, while it is significantly boosted up for both distinct branch solutions with larger hybrid nanoparticles.

Effect of impingement parameter (ùõΩùê¥) on velocities and temperature profiles
Figures 5, 6, 7 show the variation of the impingement parameter (ùõΩùê¥) on the radial velocity, azimuthal velocity, and temperature profiles for the two different solution branches in the presence of water-based Ag‚ÄìTiO2 hybrid nanofluid against the similarity variable ùúç, respectively. Figure 5 demonstrates the radial velocity of the hybrid nanofluid (HN) due to the impact of ùõΩùê¥. It is noticed that as the impingement parameter ùõΩùê¥ decelerates, the outcome of the upper branch of radial velocity reduces near the surface of the spinning disk, and contrary radial flow takes place, but infinity or far away from the surface of the spinning disk, it alters its orientation, as a result, the thickness of the boundary-layer (BLT) reduces. This tendency of water-based Ag‚ÄìTiO2 hybrid nanofluid flow gradient is owing to cause that as ùõΩùê¥ reduces, the upward motion of the spinning non-conducting disk in the upward direction of the coordinate z-axis also upsurges which results in the reduction of the BLT as well as the velocity of the forward flow. Moreover, the lower solution branch shows the contrary radial flow for the hybrid nanofluid due to the decreasing selections of ùõΩùê¥. Generally, the boundary-layer thickness decreases due to the opposite radial flow which bounds in the region of the spinning non-conducting disk surface. The variations of the parameter ùõΩùê¥ on azimuthal velocity for the two distinct solution branches of the hybrid nanofluid are shown in Fig. 6. From the figure, it is seen that the azimuthal velocity for the upper branch outcomes initially increases and then decreases as the parameter ùõΩùê¥ decreases. This behavior of the impingement velocity represents the tangential flow. In the case of the lower branch, the outcome behavior is opposite as compared to the solution of the upper branch by continuing decreasing values of ùõΩùê¥, as a consequence, the tangential BLT also reduces. However, the magnitude of the azimuthal component velocity is enhanced. The temperature profiles of the water-based Ag‚ÄìTiO2 hybrid nanofluid for the several negative values of ùõΩùê¥ are shown in Fig. 7. The profiles of temperature decrease in both the upper and lower solution branches as ùõΩùê¥ decreases. The tendency of the present behavior shows that by reducing the parameter ùõΩùê¥, the thermal BLT and the temperature near the surface of the non-conducting spinning disk decreases.

Effect of the swirl or rotation parameter (Œ©ùê¥) on velocities and temperature profiles
The graph of the radial velocity, azimuthal velocity, and temperature distribution profiles for the distinct values of ùõΩùê¥ are plotted in Figs. 8, 9 and 10 for the solution of the upper and lower branch of water-based Ag‚ÄìTiO2 hybrid nanofluid against the similarity variable ùúç, respectively. From Fig. 8, it is recognized that corresponding ùêπ‚Ä≤(ùúç) in the upper branch solution rises as Œ©ùê¥ upsurges. This behavior is generally owing to the fact of centrifugal force through which the hybrid nanofluid tiny particles are pressed in the coordinate of radial direction. It is further noted that the contrary radial flow for the solution of the upper branch is also discouraged due to the involvement of Œ©ùê¥. Although, the radial velocity outcome of the lower branch obeys quite opposite flow behavior via achieving the reverse flow near the surface of the non-conducting disk. Conversely, away from the surface of the spinning disk, the ùêπ‚Ä≤(ùúç) gains positive outputs, and as Œ©ùê¥, growths, the opposite radial direction flow also upsurges. The upper branch azimuthal velocity for the hybrid nanofluid enhances due to higher values of Œ©ùê¥ as highlighted graphically in Fig. 9. On the other hand, initially, the lower branch azimuthal velocity behaves similarly to the solution of the upper branch near the surface of the disk while then abruptly starting a decreasing behavior in velocity far away from the disk as Œ©ùê¥ increases in the domain of the similarity variable. Moreover, the azimuthal and radial velocities satisfy the boundary conditions and asymptotically converge in two distinct branches of solution due to the larger values of Œ©ùê¥. Figure 10 portrays the temperature profiles of the hybrid nanofluid in response to the larger positive values of Œ©ùê¥. Results divulge that when the positive values of Œ©ùê¥ increase, the temperature distributions in the upper branch outcome shrink, and for the solution of the lower branch, the temperature escalates.

Effect of the magnetic parameter (ùëÄùê¥) on velocities and temperature profiles
The deviation of the magnetic parameter (ùëÄùê¥) on radial velocity, azimuthal velocity, and temperature distribution profiles for the water-based Ag‚ÄìTiO2 hybrid nanofluid are illustrated in Figs. 11, 12, and 13, respectively. In these figures, the dual nature of two different type solution branches like the upper and lower branch is investigated in response of ùëÄùê¥. Figure 11 shows the radial velocity for both branches of solution in response to the magnetic parameter (ùëÄùê¥). For increasing values of ùëÄùê¥, the upper branch solution increases while the lower branch solution shows a decreasing pattern. In general scenario, the reason is due to the fact that the external electric field augments as the magnetic parameter ùëÄùê¥ increases, which produces the Lorentz force on the surface of the non-conducting disk. As a consequence, ùêπ‚Ä≤(ùúç) in the outcomes of a stable branch increase but decrease in the solution of an unstable branch while the gap between the solution curves is more in the unstable solution as compared to the stable solution. The influences of ùëÄùê¥ for distinct values on the component of azimuthal velocity and dimensionless temperature profiles for the solution of two different branches (see Figs. 12 and 13), respectively. From these figures, it is perceived that the azimuthal velocity and temperature decrease in the upper branch solution as the magnetic parameter increases, while the lower branch solution initially increases and then decreases for the transverse component of velocity but the temperature monotonically augments.

Effect of the nanoparticles volume fraction (ùúô1,ùúô2) on velocities and temperature profiles
Figures 14, 15 and 16 show the impacts of ùúô1 and ùúô2 on radial velocity, azimuthal velocity, and temperature profiles for the solution of the two distinct branches against ùúç, respectively. The radial velocity for the upper branch outcome increases due to the impact of ùúô1 and ùúô2 as shown in Fig. 14. Initially, the same tendency is perceived for the lower branch solution and later the profiles of radial velocity are diminishing owing to the higher values of ùúô1 and ùúô2. Generally, in absence of uniform convective radiation, it is noted that the volume fraction of nanoparticles escalates the fluid flow at the surface of the non-conducting disk as an upshot, the radial velocity and the boundary layer thickness increase. Further, Fig. 15 shows the azimuthal velocity for both branches of solution due to the impact of ùúô1 and ùúô2. From this figure, it is seen that the azimuthal velocity shows the contrary behavior in both branches of solution as compared to the radial velocity (see Fig. 14). Moreover, Figs. 14 and 15 satisfy the boundary conditions asymptotically owing to the higher impact of ùúô1 and ùúô2. Finally, the breach between the outcome curves in the lower branch is more relevant to the upper branch solution (see both graphs). The effects of ùúô1 and ùúô2 on temperature profiles for the solution of the upper and lower branch are illustrated in Fig. 16. The solutions of the upper branch increase with the increasing values of ùúô1 and ùúô2, while the profiles of temperature are decreasing in the lower branch solution. This behavior of solution physically agrees that as ùúô1 and ùúô2 increase, the fluid dissipate extra energy in the form of heat which boosts up the requisite temperature profiles and the thermal conductivity for the water-based Ag‚ÄìTiO2 hybrid nanofluid. Moreover, the thermal boundary layer thickness of the temperature profiles also upsurges with the influence of the tiny particles.

Flow of stream lines pattern for distinct values of the Hall current parameter (ùëö) and impingement parameter (ùõΩùê¥).
Figures 17, 18, 19 and 20 divulge the streamlines pattern of the water-based Ag‚ÄìTiO2 hybrid nanofluid for two distinct solution branches owing to distinct values of the Hall current parameter (ùëö) and impingement parameter (ùõΩùê¥), respectively. The streamlines for the stable branch display that at ùëö=0.0, reverse flow does not appear nearby to the wall surface of the non-conducting disk, and as ùëö increases and reaches the limit 0.5, the influence of the reverse flow is still absent near the wall surface and behaves similarly to the case without the effect of Hall current parameter as revealed in Fig. 17. Figure 18 specifies quite opposite tendency of the streamlines pattern for the unstable (lower branch) solution. It is seen from the figure that for the two different values of ùëö=(0.0 and 0.5), the pattern of streamlines appear closer to the surface of the disk, like a flat U-shape in both windows and ending in the intermediate of the flow regime which is the conclusion of the reverse type flow appears in the situation of the lower branch solution.

Now the pattern of streamlines for the stable (upper branch) solution illustrates that at the specific value of the impingement parameter such as ùõΩùê¥=‚àí2, the trend of the pattern of streamlines is the same as for the specific value of the Hall current parameter ùëö=0.0 (see Fig. 17). In addition, the reverse flow occurs closer to the surface of the non-conducting disk if the value of ùõΩùê¥ is taken to be more negative ‚àí8.0 (see Fig. 19). The pattern of streamlines shows the opposite tendency in the situation of lower branch solution as shown in Fig. 20. The flat U-shape streamlines appear (like Fig. 18) for the outcome of the lower branch near the surface due to the specific negative value of ùõΩùê¥=‚àí2.0, while ending the streamlines pattern in the middle of the window flow region which is the result of arising the reverse flow. For ùõΩùê¥=‚àí8.0, the flow pattern of the lines for the unstable branch indicates that the impact of the contrary flow still survives but is closer to the surface of the non-conducting disk (see Fig. 20).

Conclusion
The Hall current features of time-dependent stagnation-point flow of a hybrid nanofluid over a spinning disk were investigated numerically. A set of nonlinear ODEs was derived by using similarity variables. The water-based silver and titanium nanoparticles were incorporated. Influences of different flow parameters assist in compiling the concluding remarks stated as follows:

The domain of the solution of the lower branch reduces due to increasing of the rotating parameter.

The greater values of ùõΩùê¥ accelerating the phenomenon of reverse flow for both solutions.

The swirl parameter augments the velocity in both directions and declines the temperature in the upper branch solution, while the contrary behavior is observed in the lower branch solution.

The radial velocity increases due to ùëÄùê¥ in the outcome of the upper branch and decreases in the lower branch, while the azimuthal velocity decreases in both solution branches.

The temperature reduces due to ùëÄùê¥ in the upper branch solution and increases in the lower branch solution.

The nanoparticles volume fraction enhances the radial velocity and decreases the azimuthal velocity in the upper branch solution, while the temperature uplifts. The reverse trend is seen in the lower branch solution.

As ùõΩùê¥ declines, the impact of the reverse flow near to the surface of the non-conducting disk confines.
