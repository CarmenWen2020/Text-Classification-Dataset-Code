With the rapid growth of social media, massive misinformation is also spreading widely on social media,
e.g., Weibo and Twitter, and brings negative effects to human life. Today, automatic misinformation identification has drawn attention from academic and industrial communities. Whereas an event on social media
usually consists of multiple microblogs, current methods are mainly constructed based on global statistical features. However, information on social media is full of noise, which should be alleviated. Moreover,
most of the microblogs about an event have little contribution to the identification of misinformation, where
useful information can be easily overwhelmed by useless information. Thus, it is important to mine significant microblogs for constructing a reliable misinformation identification method. In this article, we propose
an attention-based approach for identification of misinformation (AIM). Based on the attention mechanism,
AIM can select microblogs with the largest attention values for misinformation identification. The attention
mechanism in AIM contains two parts: content attention and dynamic attention. Content attention is the
calculated-based textual features of each microblog. Dynamic attention is related to the time interval between the posting time of a microblog and the beginning of the event. To evaluate AIM, we conduct a series
of experiments on the Weibo and Twitter datasets, and the experimental results show that the proposed AIM
model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

1 INTRODUCTION
With the rapid growth of social media, e.g., Facebook, Twitter, and Weibo, people are sharing information and expressing their attitudes publicly. Social media brings great convenience to users,
and information can be spread rapidly and widely today. However, misinformation can also be
spread on the Internet more easily. Misinformation brings significant harm to daily life, social harmony, and even public security. With the growth of the Internet and social media, such harm will
also increase. For instance, as the loss of MH370 has drawn worldwide attention, a great amount of
misinformation has spread on social media, e.g., MH370 has landed in China,1 the loss of MH370 is
caused by terrorists,2 and Russian jets are related to the loss of MH370.3 This misinformation about
MH370 misleads public attitudes toward a wrong direction and delays the search of MH370. Up to
March 15, 2017, on the biggest Chinese microblog Web site Sina Weibo,4 32,076 pieces of misinformation have been reported and collected in its misinformation management center.5 Accordingly,
it is crucial to evaluate information credibility and detect misinformation on social media.
In this work, we need to identify whether an event on social media is misinformation or true
information. An event refers to a piece of news spreading on social media, e.g., “MH370 has been
found in the international waters near Perth.” Usually, an event, which may be misinformation
or true information, contains a group of microblogs, which may include postings, repostings, and
comments.
Today, to automatically identify misinformation on social media, some methods have been proposed. Most existing methods identify misinformation at the microblog level [3, 11, 30] or the
event level [18, 25, 44]. Some studies investigate the aggregation of credibility from the microblog
level to the event level [14]. However, considering dynamic information, some work designs temporal features based on the prorogation properties over time [18] or trains a model with features
generated from different time periods [25]. Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [26] have
been incorporated for misinformation identification, and the gated recurrent unit (GRU) structure [7] has proved to have satisfactory performance [24]. Moreover, some methods take usage of
users’ feedback (comments and attitudes) to evaluate the credibility [9, 32, 44]. For instance, signal
tweets, which indicates users’ skepticism about factual claims, have been taken out for detecting
misinformation [44].
Although the preceding methods succeed in misinformation identification, they have severe
drawbacks. Among these methods, some identify misinformation according to global statistical
features of an event or a time window, and some calculate the credibility of each microblog and
then aggregate them to the credibility of the whole event. However, information on social media is
full of noise, which should be alleviated. Moreover, most of microblogs about an event have little
contribution to the identification of misinformation. As shown in the example of misinformation
on Sina Weibo in Table 1, most users simply repost the fake news or credence to the misinformation. Only a few users express their questions about the misinformation. Thus, it is important
to select those significant microblogs and obtain reliable features to construct a misinformation
identification method.
Fortunately, the attention mechanism [13] is suitable for selecting the most significant components of information. Via the attention mechanism, components that contribute more to a specific
task have large weights for satisfying the objective as much as possible. The attention mechanism
has succeeded in multiple tasks, e.g., visual object detection [1], image caption generation [39], machine translation [2], text summarization [33], and text classification [35]. Accordingly, with the

attention mechanism, we are able to mine significant microblogs for identifying misinformation
and design a reliable automatic detection method.
Moreover, early detection of misinformation is another important and practical task, in which
we need to detect misinformation as early as possible [24, 44]. Thus, we can take immediate action
at the beginning stage of the spreading of misinformation and minimize the baneful influence.
For early detection, we need to identify misinformation with the first several microblogs. Thus,
existing methods are not qualified for practical early detection due to the conflict between the
models and the task. Meanwhile, with the attention mechanism, we can identify misinformation
with several significant microblogs. This minimizes the conflict between the models and the task.
Accordingly, the attention mechanism is naturally suitable for early detection of misinformation.
In this work, we propose AIM. First, for each microblog belonging to an event, we calculate a
corresponding attention value based on its textual features. This attention value is named content
attention. Second, considering that microblogs posted at different times have distinct significance
for the event, we calculate dynamic attention for each microblog. Dynamic attention can be determined related to the time interval between the posting time of a microblog and the beginning
of the event. Then we aggregate the content attention and the dynamic attention, and we obtain
the final attention weights for each microblog belonging to an event. The weighted sum of these
microblogs can be performed to generate the representation of the whole event. Finally, true information can be separated from misinformation based on the event representation.

In summary, the main contributions of this work are listed as follows:
• We incorporate the attention mechanism for misinformation identification on social media,
which mines the most significant microblogs.
• We design both content attention and dynamic attention for capturing different aspects of
significance of microblogs for misinformation identification.
• Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets (i.e., the Weibo and Twitter datasets)
show that AIM is effective and outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly.
• Visualization of the leaned attention mechanism in AIM demonstrates the rationality of our
proposed method.
The rest of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review some related work on
misinformation identification and the attention mechanism. Then we detail the proposed AIM
model in Section 3. In Section 4, we conduct and analyze experiments on two real-world datasets
and compare them to several state-of-the-art methods. In Section 5, we illustrate some visualization
examples of the leaned attention mechanism. Section 6 concludes this work and discusses future
research directions.
2 RELATED WORK
In this section, we briefly review some related works on misinformation identification and attention mechanism.
2.1 Misinformation Identification
Recently, many methods have been put forward for misinformation automatic identification. The
work of Kumar et al. [17] analyzes impact and characteristics of hoax articles in Wikipedia and proposes an efficient method to identify these Wikipedia hoaxes. On social media, some researchers
identify misinformation at the post level [3, 30], i.e., classifying a single microblog post as being
credible or not based on tweet-based features. Some perform a characterization analysis for the
spread of fake images of microblog posts during crisis events [11]. Some identify whether an event
belongs to misinformation or truth information and extract handcrafted features from the event
level [18, 25, 36, 44]. Another work obtains credibility of a microblog post and then aggregates
credibility to the event level [14]. Moreover, some other works extract more effective handcrafted
features. For instance, the work of Jin et al. [15] takes advantage of “wisdom of crowds” to identify
fake news, i.e., mining opposing voices from conflicting viewpoints. Based on the time series of
misinformation lifecycle, the temporal characteristics of social context information are captured
in Kwon et al. [18] and Ma et al. [25]. The work of Del Giudice [9] and Rieh et al. [32] investigates
the Web page credibility through users’ feedback. Signals tweets are identified from trending misinformation via finding signature text phrases expressing skepticism about factual claims [44].
Recently, an RNN-based model attempted to capture the dynamic temporal signals in the misinformation diffusion process and incrementally learn both the temporal and textual representations
of an event [24].
2.2 Attention Mechanism
The attention mechanism is first applied to a visual attention system for rapid scene analysis [13].
The visual attention system selects attended locations in order of decreasing saliency so that a
complex scene can be understood by rapidly selecting saliency locations in a computationally efficient method. In recent years, the deep neural network (DNN) has become increasingly popular.
The attention mechanism is once again taken out to be integrated into DNNs. The attention mechanism is incorporated into the RNN in Mnih et al. [29] to attend to different locations within the
ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, Vol. 9, No. 5, Article 50. Publication date: April 2018.
An Attention-Based Approach for Identification of Misinformation 50:5
images one at a time and process them sequentially. The attention mechanism can help control
expensive computation independent of the input image size and learn tracking without explicit
training signals.
Furthermore, the work of Ba et al. [1] extends the attention RNN model to a multiple-objects
detection task that is learning to both localize and recognize multiple objects despite being given
only class labels. For an image caption task, an attention-based model is able to automatically fix
its attention on salient objects of an input image while generating the corresponding words of the
output sentence [39]. Some employ the attention mechanism in a visual question-answering task,
e.g., generating question-guided attention to image feature maps for each question [5], a questionguided spatial attention to images for questions of spatial inference [38], and querying an image
and inferring the answer multiple times to narrow down the attention to images progressively via
stacked attention networks [41]. For fine-grain image classification, the attention-based convolutional neural networks (CNN) model has been found to perform better by identifying which one
is to be attended to and what can be extracted without any expensive annotations, e.g., bounding
box or part information [37].
In the field of natural language processing, researchers first introduce the attention mechanism
to neural machine translation. Based on a primitive encoder-decoder architecture, the work of
Bahdanau et al. [2] searches a source sentence to attend to the most relevant words to predict a
target word. Some extend the attention mechanism to global and local ones and compare different
methods of obtaining attention scores [23]. Moreover, a hierarchical attention mechanism guides
layers in a CNN model to model text in Yin et al. [43]. The work of Dhingra et al. [8] integrates
a multihop architecture with a gated attention layer based on multiple interactions between the
query embedding and the intermediate states of a recurrent document reader. In addition, the
attention mechanism is introduced into other research issues, e.g., abstractive text summarization
[33], the text comprehension task [8, 16, 43], relation classification [34, 45] and text classification
[42]. In Chorowski et al. [6], a novel model for speech recognition is proposed, which incorporates
both content-based attention [2, 39] and location-based attention [10].
3 PROPOSED METHOD
In this section, we first define and formulate the problem. We then detail the proposed AIM model.
Finally, we present the parameter learning procedure for the AIM model.
3.1 Problem Definition
The problem studied in this article can be defined and formulated as follows. An event refers to a
piece of news spreading on social media, e.g., “MH370 has been found in the international waters
near Perth.” The event can be true or false. Each event is associated with multiple microblogs, containing postings, repostings, and comments. These microblogs, which may have different degrees
of importance and credibility, describe various aspects of the event. In this work, based on all of
these microblogs, our task is to identify whether an event on social media is misinformation or not.
Suppose that a set of events is denoted as E = {e1, e2,..., en }. lei is the label of the corresponding event ei , where lei = 1 means that event ei is misinformation and lei = 0 otherwise. The
microblogs of the event ei can be denoted as Mei = [mei
1 ,mei
2 ,...,mei
nei
], where nei is the total
number of microblogs of this event. All microblog sets can be written as M = {Me1 , Me2 ,..., Men }.
Each microblog mei
j consists of its content feature vector f
ei
j and posting time t
ei
j . Then content
feature vectors and the posting time of event ei can be denoted as Fei = [f
ei
1 ,f
ei
2 ,...,f
ei
nei
] and
Tei = [t
ei
1 ,t
ei
2 ,...,t
ei
nei
], respectively.

Fig. 1. Illustration of the proposed AIM model. The attention mechanism in AIM contains two parts: content attention and dynamic attention. Content attention is calculated based on the textual features of each
microblog. Dynamic attention is related to the time interval between the posting time of a microblog and
the beginning of the event.
3.2 The Attention Mechanism for Misinformation Identification
As we know, information on social media is usually full of noise, which should be alleviated. Moreover, most microblogs about an event have little contribution to the identification of misinformation, and useful information can be easily overwhelmed by useless information. Thus, a reliable
misinformation identification method can benefit from mining several most significant microblogs.
Meanwhile, the attention mechanism [13] is suitable for and widely applied in selecting the most
significant components of information [1, 2, 33, 35, 39]. Via the attention mechanism, components
that contribute more to a specific task have large weights for satisfying the objective as much as
possible. Thus, we propose a reliable automatic detection method to mine signification microblogs
for identifying misinformation based on the attention mechanism.
ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, Vol. 9, No. 5, Article 50. Publication date: April 2018.
An Attention-Based Approach for Identification of Misinformation 50:7
For an event ei that contains microblogs Mei = [mei
1 ,mei
2 ,...,mei
nei
], we have a function A (ei ) to
calculate attention values for each microblog. To capture content features and dynamic properties
simultaneously, we have content attention and dynamic attention that can be calculated via Ac (ei )
and At (ei ), respectively. We will discuss them further in Sections 3.3 and 3.4. This process can be
formulated as follows:
A (ei ) = Ac (ei ) + At (ei ) , (1)
which outputs a nei -dimensional attention value vector. This vector can be further normalized,
and thus we can obtain an attention weight vector:
vei = softmax (A (ei )) , (2)
where vei ∈ Rnei , denoting weights for each microblog belonging to event ei . A large attention
weight indicates that the corresponding microblog has a significant effect on misinformation
identification.
Then a weighted sum of all microblogs can be performed to generate the representation of the
whole event:
r
ei = Fei vei , (3)
where Fei ∈ Rd×nei and rei ∈ Rd . rei denotes the final representation of event ei , and Fei =
[f
ei
1 ,f
ei
2 ,...,f
ei
nei
] denotes content features of microblogs Mei . Here we use textual embeddings
of microblogs as content features. In this work, we apply para2vec [19] for extracting embeddings
of microblogs. Para2vec is an extended version of word2vec [28] and is a state-of-the-art method
for extracting sentence embeddings. In this work, we empirically set the dimensionality of embeddings as d = 50.
Finally, the prediction on ei can be made with a logistic regression:
ˆ
lei = sigmoid
WT r
ei + b

, (4)
where W ∈ Rd and b ∈ R. ˆ
lei = 1 means that event ei is predicted to be misinformation and ˆ
lei = 0
otherwise. The larger the predicted value, the lower the credibility of event ei .
3.3 Content Attention
Content features of microblogs are the most important factor for describing an event. These features can tell us what has happened and how people react. Thus, it is vital to generate attention
values based on textual embeddings Fei = [f
ei
1 ,f
ei
2 ,...,f
ei
nei
] of microblogs. Moreover, when people
make comments about the information of an event, the original content, i.e., the first microblog
that describes what has happened, is usually not included. To model a comment’s correlation with
the original content for deciding its significance, we concatenate the textual embedding of the
very first microblog and obtain the embeddings Fei
0 = [f
ei
1 ,f
ei
1 ,...,f
ei
1 ] of the event. Based on the
microblog embeddings and the event embeddings, we can calculate content attention values for
microblogs belonging to the same event.
First, we transfer above embeddings to a hidden space:
Hei = tanh 
Wh

Fei
0
Fei

, (5)
where Wh ∈ Rdh ×2d and Hei ∈ Rdh ×nei . Hei denotes the hidden representations of microblogs Mei ,
and dh denotes the dimensionality of the hidden space. This hidden space allows the interaction
between microblog embeddings and event embeddings, and brings a new space for calculating
content attention values.
ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, Vol. 9, No. 5, Article 50. Publication date: April 2018.    
50:8 Q. Liu et al.
Then we can calculate content attention values as:
Ac (ei ) = WT
a Hei , (6)
where Wa ∈ Rdh . These generated content attention values can be further managed as shown in
Equation (1).
3.4 Dynamic Attention
In addition to content features, the posting time of a microblog is also vital for deciding its significance. At the beginning of an event, microblogs can tell what is going on about the event, which
is important for knowing the whole picture of the event. With the spread of information, the reaction of common people is usually to repost, repeat, and echo the message, which has little value
for identification. Slowly, some people tend to think about the event, or some people knowing
the fact appear. Thus, people start to express their own attitudes, which may include suspicion,
affirmation, and denial. This information can help identify misinformation.
Accordingly, we incorporate dynamic attention, which can be determined related to the time
interval between the posting time of a microblog and the beginning of the event. The beginning of
an event is the posting time of the very first microblog of the corresponding event. For example,
the beginning time of event ei is t
ei
1 . Accordingly, dynamic attention values can be calculated as
follows:
At (ei ) =

ct
ei
1 −t
ei
1 , ct
ei
2 −t
ei
1 ,..., ct
ei
nei −t
ei
1

, (7)
where ct
ei
j −t
ei
1 denotes the dynamic attention value of the corresponding time interval t
ei
j − t
ei
1 .
These generated dynamic attention values can be further managed as shown in Equation (1).
Furthermore, if we learn a distinct attention value for every possible continuous time interval
value, we have to estimate a great number of parameters and the model tends to overfit. Here,
following several methods [20–22], we equally partition the range of all possible time interval
values into discrete bins. Specifically, in this work, the range of all possible time interval values
is partitioned into 1-hour bins. Only the attention values of the upper and lower bounds of time
bins are needed to be estimated in our model. For time interval values in a time bin, their attention
values can be calculated via a linear interpolation.
Suppose that we have an arbitrary time interval value td = t
ei
j − t
ei
1 . Mathematically, the corresponding dynamic attention value ctd can be calculated as follows:
ctd = cL(td ) (U (td ) − td ) + cU (td ) (td − L(td ))
U (td ) − L(td ) , (8)
where U (td ) and L(td ) denote the upper bound and lower bound of time interval value td , and
cU (td ) and cL(td ) denote the dynamic attention values for U (td ) and L(td ), respectively. Such a
linear interpolation method can solve the problem of learning attention values for continuous
time intervals. Note that although the change of dynamic attention values in each discrete time
bin is linear, the global change in the entire range of all possible time interval values is nonlinear.
To make the calculation of dynamic attention clear, we can explain with an example. If we want
to calculate the attention value for time interval td = 1.6h, then the upper bound and lower bound
of 1.6h will be U (td ) = 2h and L(td ) = 1h, respectively. The corresponding attention value c1.6h
can be calculated as follows:
c1.6h = c1h (2h − 1.6h) + c2h (1.6h − 1h)
2h − 1h = 0.4c1h + 0.6c2h . (9)

The proposed AIM model can be trained in an end-to-end way by backpropagation. The goal of
training is to minimize the following error between lei and ˆ

where λ is the L2-regularization term and θ = {W, b, Wh, Wa, c} , denoting all parameters needed
to be learned in AIM. Then the derivations of J with respect to all parameters can be calculated, and
we can employ stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to estimate the model parameters. The training
procedure consists of two parts: the training of the attention mechanism that learns Wh, Wa, and
c, and the training of the logistic regression that learns W and b. These two parts of training are
done alternately. This process is repeated iteratively until the convergence is achieved.
4 EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we first present our experimental settings. We then report experiment results of
AIM on misinformation identification and compare to several state-of-the-art methods. We also investigate the impact of hyperparameters in AIM. Moreover, we study the performance comparison
on early detection of misinformation.
4.1 Experimental Settings
To evaluate the performance of AIM, following some representative previous works [24, 25], we
conduct experiments on the Weibo and Twitter datasets. Detailed statistics of the two datasets
can be found in Table 2. Misinformation in the Weibo dataset is collected from the Weibo misinformation management center,6 which reports various misinformation. A similar number of true
information is collected by crawling microblogs of general threads that are not reported as misinformation. Misinformation and true information are confirmed on Snopes,7 which is an online
misinformation debunking service.
In our experiments, we randomly choose 10% of events in each dataset for model tuning, and
the rest 90% are randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio for training and testing. Empirically, the L2-
regularization term is set to be λ = 0.001, the learning rate of SGD is set to be 0.01, and the dimensionality of microblog embeddings is set to be d = 50. The dimensionality dh of hidden space for
generating content attention is turned in our experiments.
Moreover, we adopt several evaluation metrics for evaluating the performance of AIM and other
compared methods: accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. Accuracy is a standard metric for

classification tasks, which is evaluated by the percentage of correctly predicted misinformation
and true information. Precision, recall, and f1-score are widely used metrics for classification tasks,
which are computed according to where correctly predicted misinformation or true information
appear in the predicted list. The larger the values of the preceding evaluation metrics, the better
the performance.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of AIM, several state-of-the-art methods are compared in our
experiments:
• GRU has been incorporated for misinformation identification. A model based on two GRU
hidden layers [7] and textual features in dynamic time windows achieves satisfactory performance in both misinformation identification and misinformation early detection [24].
• SVM-TS is a linear support vector machine (SVM) [4] classifier that uses time-series structures to model the variation of social context features [25]. Handcrafted features based on
content, users, and propagation patterns are replicated.
• DT-Rank is a ranking model based on a decision tree [31] to identify trending misinformation [44]. DT-Rank searches for enquiry phrases and cluster disputed factual claims, and
ranks the clustered results based on statistical features.
• DTC is a decision tree classifier [3]. It uses handcrafted features based on the overall statistics of the posts rather than temporal information.
• SVM-RBF is an SVM-based model with the radical basis function (RBF) kernel [40]. It also
uses handcrafted features based on the overall statistics of the posts.
• DFC is a random forest classifier [12] using three parameters to fit the temporal posting
volume curve [18]. Same handcrafted features are used as in SVM-TS.
For our proposed AIM model, we implement it with Python8 and Theano.9 Moreover, versions of
AIM without event embeddings, content attention, and dynamic attention are also implemented
and compared for evaluating the impact of different components of AIM. To show the significant
improvements of our proposed methods, experiments are done 20 times, and the ranges of accuracies of our proposed methods are illustrated in Table 3.
4.2 Performance Comparison on Misinformation Identification
Table 3 illustrates the performance comparison of misinformation among AIM and several stateof-the-art models on the Weibo and Twitter datasets. According to the conclusion in Section 4.4,
the dimensionality of the hidden space for generating content attention is dh = 40. We can see that
the performance ranking of misinformation identification methods is as follows: AIM, GRU, SVMTS, RFC, DTC, SVM-RBF, and DT-Rank. Compared to neural network–based methods, i.e., AIM
and GRU, the performance of other methods is relatively poor. The methods using handcrafted
features or rules may not adapt to shape dynamic and underlying correlations in social media. In
contrast, neural network–based methods, AIM and GRU, can learn high-level interactions among
deep latent features, which can better model real-world scenarios.
Among those conventional methods, DT-Rank uses a set of regular expressions selected from
signal microblog posts containing skeptical enquiries. But not all microblog posts in both the Twitter and Weibo datasets involve these skeptical enquiries. These selected expressions are insufficient
to conclude the information credibility. Moreover, SVM-TS and RFC incorporate the dynamic properties into conventional models, which helps outperform other compared methods e.g., SVM-RBF

and DTC. Thus, we can conclude that dynamic properties are important features for misinformation identification.
From the experimental results, we can clearly observe that GRU achieves the best performance
among all compared methods. It is obvious that AIM obtains significant improvement over GRU.
On the Weibo dataset, compared to GRU, AIM improves performance by 2.8%, 2.2%, and 3.4% evaluated by accuracy, f1-score (misinformation), and f1-score (true information), respectively. On the
Twitter dataset, the improvements become 3.9%, 2.3%, and 2.8%. Despite the fact that both AIM
and GRU learn deep latent features from a sequence of groups of microblog posts, a trained GRU
model possesses a constant recurrent transition matrix, which induces unchangeable propagations
of sequence signals between every two consecutive time windows. However, in real-world scenarios, social media is so dynamic and complicated that the preceding constant recurrent transition
matrix of the GRU model has its limitations in shaping an adequate misinformation identification
model. Moreover, the GRU model has a bias toward the latest elements that it takes as input [27],
whereas key features of both misinformation and true information do not necessarily appear at
the rear part of an input sequence. Meanwhile, all compared methods, including GRU, cannot select significant microblogs for misinformation identification, and thus massive useless information
will lower performance. Via overcoming these shortcomings, AIM shows its superiority in misinformation identification, which is proven by the experimental results. Moreover, via experiments

information.
performed 20 times, the ranges of accuracies of our proposed methods in Table 3 demonstrate the
significant improvements of AIM compared to other methods.
4.3 Impact of Different Components of AIM
To investigate the impact of event embeddings F0 in content attention on misinformation identification, we implement a version of AIM without event embeddings, denoted as AIM (-F0). The
corresponding performance on misinformation identification is shown in Table 3. Compared to
AIM, AIM (-F0) slightly decreases the performance on both datasets. This indicates that a comment’s correlation with the original content indeed has a contribution in deciding its significance.
However, such an effect is not very significant.
Furthermore, to investigate the impact of content attention Ac, a version of AIM, i.e., AIM (-Ac),
is implemented and compared in Table 3. Compared to AIM, AIM (-Ac) decreases the accuracy
by 5.0% and 4.4% on the Weibo dataset and the Twitter dataset, respectively. This shows that the
content attention is very important for the attention mechanism. Moreover, from the results in
Table 3, it is obvious that content attention has larger significance than dynamic attention for
misinformation identification.
Similarly, to investigate the impact of dynamic attention At, AIM (-At) is compared in Table 3.
Compared to AIM, AIM (-At) decreases the accuracy by 0.9% and 2.6% on the Weibo dataset and
the Twitter dataset, respectively. It is obvious that the decay brought by AIM (-At) is relatively
large. This indicates that the posting time of a microblog is important for deciding its significance,
and dynamic attention is vital for misinformation identification. Moreover, AIM (-At) can still outperform GRU, which means that AIM with only content attention can beat the compared methods.
4.4 Impact of Dimensionality
The dimensionality dh of hidden space for generating content attention is a hyperparameter in
AIM. To investigate its impact on the performance of AIM, we illustrate the performance of AIM
evaluated by accuracy and f1-score with varying dh = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] in Figure 2. The f1-score
is evaluated for both misinformation and true information.
From the figure, on both datasets, we can clearly observe that the performance of AIM increases
rapidly from dh = 10. It achieves the best performance at dh = 40 and then decreases with the
ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, Vol. 9, No. 5, Article 50. Publication date: April 2018.
An Attention-Based Approach for Identification of Misinformation 50:13
increasing dimensionality. Curves evaluated by accuracy, f1-score (misinformation), and f1-score
(true information) share similar trends. From our observation, we select the best dimensionality
of AIM as dh = 40 and report the corresponding results in the rest of our experiments. Moreover,
these curves show that AIM is not very sensitive to the hidden dimensionality in a large range,
and it can still outperform the compared methods even without the best dimensionality.
4.5 Performance Comparison on Early Detection of Misinformation
The early detection of misinformation is an important and practical task. We need to detect misinformation as early as possible. Thus, we can take immediate action at the beginning stage of
the spread of misinformation and minimize the baneful influence. To investigate the performance
of AIM on early detection of misinformation, we select the most competitive methods, i.e., GRU
and SVM-TS, with highest accuracies according to Table 3 and illustrate their performance with
varying detection deadlines in Figure 3. The performance is evaluated by accuracy, and dh = 40.
For reckoning the average reporting time over misinformation, conventional early detection tasks
count on official announcements made by debunking services, e.g., Snopes and Sina Community
Management Center. Thus, we take the official report time as a baseline.
As shown in the figure, the accuracy of most methods will experience a conspicuous climb
during the first few hours and then rise with different growth rates, convergence rates, and convergence accuracies. For instance, the accuracy curve of SVM-TS climbs slowly in the early phase
and gradually converges to a relatively low accuracy. Moreover, its accuracy curve still fluctuates
after the official report time. However, the accuracy curve of GRU climbs rapidly in the early phase
and converges to a much higher accuracy on a much earlier deadline than that of SVM-TS.
The proposed AIM models can reach relatively high accuracy at a very early time, whereas
other methods will take a longer time to achieve good performance. Furthermore, compared to
the performance of GRU and SVM-TS, that of the proposed AIM model takes a relatively large
lead at any phase. On the Weibo dataset, the accuracy of AIM can reach more than 90%, which is a
very high accuracy and even larger than the performance of GRU on misinformation identification,
in just 2 hours. At the official report time on the Weibo and Twitter datasets, the accuracy of AIM
reaches about 93% and 77%, respectively. These experimental results show that the proposed AIM
model is very practical for early detection of misinformation.
Most state-of-the-art methods for early detection, e.g., GRU and SVM-TS, usually follow the
intuitive paradigm to model time-series features in sequences of microblog posts. But these timeseries–based models are not qualified for practical early detection due to the conflict between the
models and the task. For example, GRU requires, on one hand, that the input sequence of dynamic
temporal signals should be long enough to be captured, whereas on the other hand, early detection
of misinformation requires that the input sequence must be limited. The limited input sequence
may not cover required dynamic temporal signals. Thus, GRU may not be suitable for early detection of misinformation in some cases. With the attention mechanism, AIM identifies misinformation with several significant microblogs. This minimizes the conflict between the models and the
task, and makes AIM a naturally suitable model for early detection of misinformation.
5 VISUALIZATION
In this section, we present the visualization of the leaned attention mechanism for demonstrating
the rationality of our proposed AIM model. First, we illustrate the curves of the learned dynamic
attention values in AIM. Then, we pick several events, including both misinformation and true
information, and illustrate microblogs with the largest weights in each event.

5.1 Visualization of Dynamic Attention
In Figure 4, we illustrate the learned dynamic attention values in AIM on the Weibo and Twitter datasets. The dynamic attention values for different time intervals since the beginning of an
event are normalized. A higher dynamic attention value indicates that microblogs posted at the
corresponding time interval have larger significance for misinformation identification.
From the curves on the Weibo and Twitter datasets, we can draw similar conclusions. At the
very beginning of an event, we have the largest dynamic attention values. This means that the

Then the attention values decrease rapidly until about the 5-hour mark. This may indicate that
during this time period, people tend to repost and echo the message, and there is little useful
information. Then the curve starts to increase and achieves another high level. This shows that at
this moment, people start to think and express their own attitudes, which may include suspicion,
affirmation, and denial. Finally, the curve tends to shock and then stay stable. Curves in Figure 4
demonstrate the rationality of the learned dynamic attention values in AIM and provide proofs for
the contribution of dynamic attention on misinformation identification.

event has very large attention weight. This is consistent with our intuition, because the original
microblog details what has happened, which is important for understanding the event. Among
other microblogs with large attention weights, most are about denying the event, questioning the
real situation, suspecting the event, or sarcasm. Obviously, the attention mechanism in AIM can
mine microblogs that are the most significant for misinformation. This makes AIM a reliable misinformation detection approach, which can alleviated noisy and useless information.
Tables 8 and 9 illustrate two examples of true information. Example 1 is about the birthday of a
panda called Panpan. Example 2 is an incredible and funny story about a stupid thief. Although the
second example is a little absurd and hard to believe, it is a piece of true information and has been
correctly classified by AIM. As in Tables 4 through 7, the original microblog of true information
has very large attention weight. However, other significant microblogs are different from those in
Tables 4 through 7. Comments in Tables 8 and 9 mostly reflect the event or the news itself. Based
on significant microblogs, the difference between misinformation and true information can easily
be distinguished by AIM.
6 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this article, we propose a novel attention-based approach for misinformation identification on
social media. The attention mechanism in our proposed AIM model consists of two parts: content
attention and dynamic attention. Content attention is calculated based textual features of each
ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, Vol. 9, No. 5, Article 50. Publication date: April 2018.
50:18 Q. Liu et al.
microblog. Dynamic attention is related to the time interval between the posting time of a microblog and the beginning of the event. Via aggregation of the content attention and the dynamic
attention, we can obtain the final attention weights for each microblog belonging to an event. A
weighted sum of these microblogs can be performed to generate the final representation of the
whole event. The experimental results on two real datasets, i.e., the Weibo and Twitter datasets,
show that AIM can outperform the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the visualization of the
leaned attention mechanism in AIM illustrates the rationality of our proposed model.
In the future, we plan to explore the following directions. In AIM, multiple features, e.g., posted
images and propagation structure, are not incorporated. Thus, we can incorporate more features in
our model. Moreover, AIM is a static model, i.e., parameters in AIM do not change among different
time periods. However, the trend of topics on social media is dynamic over time, and we usually
have different hot topics in different time periods. Thus, it is necessary to incorporate time-aware
or topic-aware mechanism in AIM.
