Internet of Things (IoT) is an ever-expanding ecosystem that integrates software, hardware, physical objects, and computing devices to communicate, collect, and exchange data. The IoT provides a seamless platform to facilitate interactions between humans and a variety of physical and virtual things, including personalized healthcare domains. Lack of access to medical resources, growth of the elderly population with chronic diseases and their needs for remote monitoring, an increase in medical costs, and the desire for telemedicine in developing countries, make the IoT an interesting subject in healthcare systems. The IoT has a potential to decrease the strain on sanitary systems besides providing tailored health services to improve the quality of life. Therefore, this paper aims to identify, compare systematically, and classify existing investigations taxonomically in the Healthcare IoT (HIoT) systems by reviewing 146 articles between 2015 and 2020. Additionally, we present a comprehensive taxonomy in the HIoT, analyze the articles technically, and classify them into five categories, including sensor-based, resource-based, communication-based, application-based, and security-based approaches. Furthermore, the benefits and limitations of the selected methods, with a comprehensive comparison in terms of evaluation techniques, evaluation tools, and evaluation metrics, are included. Finally, based on the reviewed studies, power management, trust and privacy, fog computing, and resource management as leading open issues; tactile Internet, social networks, big data analytics, SDN/NFV, Internet of nano things, and blockchain as important future trends; and interoperability, real-testbed implementation, scalability, and mobility as challenges are worth more studying and researching in HIoT systems.

1. Introduction
Today's world has been involved with many challenges related to public health issues of chronic diseases due to threatening infections such as COVID-19. The rise in health problems along with high healthcare costs encourage everyone, especially elderly and disabled people, to use remote health management via computer-aided technologies (Garg et al., 2020), (Hosseinzadehet al., 2020a). In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT), as a network of connected devices that interact with one another, plays an important role in enabling automation in many fields such as remote and smart healthcare systems. Technologically, the IoT consists of some popular technologies such as wireless body area networks (WBANs), wireless sensor networks (WSNs) (Mainetti et al., 2011), and radio frequency identification (RFID) to transfer the obtained data to the cloud for analyzing and extracting meaningful data for on-time proper decision making (Al-Fuqaha et al., 2015), (Asghari et al., 2019a), (Baker et al., 2017). With a rise in the desire to make healthcare more personalized, proactive, and cost-effective, the IoT can be considered and employed as a significant technology in health management systems (e.g., mental health and global pandemic (COVID19)) (Garg et al., 2020), (Al-Fuqaha et al., 2015). In this regard, the implementation of IoT in healthcare can be classified into three parts (Tsiounia et al., 2019): i) tracing people and other objects (staff, medical teams, and patients), ii) people authentication and identification, and iii) automatic data sensing and collection. For example, the IoT provides health monitoring anytime and anywhere around the human body with WBAN technology, and can prevent from hospital infections, emergencies management, and post-discharge care. Therefore, the IoT completely redefines devices, applications, and people in the healthcare domain (Habibzadeh et al., 2020), (Atzori et al., 2010).

Henceforward, healthcare environments can be extensively revolutionized by the use of IoT opportunities such as the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) technology that includes connected medical sensors or special medical devices to provide a personalized approach to healthcare delivery (Gatouillat et al., 2018). The use of IoMT technology in healthcare systems, called Healthcare Internet of Things (HIoT) creates appropriate therapeutic strategies for patients by connecting medical devices to the Internet and carrying out various telehealth services such as the supervision of elderlies, telemonitoring, teleconsultations, and computer-assisted rehabilitation. In most articles, the terms IoMT and HIoT have been applied as alternatives for the integration of medical devices and applications that can be connected to health care information technology systems in an IoT-based environment (Habibzadeh et al., 2020). On the other hand, the convergence of big data and IoT is a new concept in sanitary systems that leads to smart management of the healthcare processes (Lu and Liu, 2011), (Karimi et al., 2021). Big data analytics has enabled prescriptive, autonomous, and predictive analysis of healthcare approaches. To this end, personalized healthcare enables remote monitoring of patients, diagnosis, early detection, and diseases prevention, especially chronic diseases such as diabetes, obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, arthritis, and heart disease (Lloret et al., 2017).

To date, a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of research on HIoT that specifies the advance in general and identifies research questions, trends, and future directions of HIoT in particular has rarely been conducted. With the increasing desire for IoT in healthcare, exploring a study scheme for HIoT systems is necessary. A systematic review identifies, categorizes, and synthesizes a comparative method of investigation and leads to knowledge transfer in research associations. To this end, we aim to answer the following research questions (RQs) by reviewing the existing studies:

•
What are the major practical motivations behind associating IoT in healthcare systems?

•
What research scopes exist in IoT-based healthcare systems? Besides, what achievements are there in this area?

•
What are the existing techniques and approaches that enable IoT in healthcare systems?

•
What are the existing open issues, future trends, and key challenges in HIoT? And what research directions should form in HIoT systems in the future?

We followed guidelines in (Brereton et al., 2007), (KitchenhamKeele, 2004) to conduct an SLR with the aim of identification, classification, and systematic comparison of the existing studies concentrating on IoT in healthcare. In other words, this study intends to present, systematically identify, and taxonomically classify the investigations on HIoT that leads to providing an exhaustive comparison with the analysis of limitations and potentials of the current papers. This review presents a systematic review of the recent researches focusing on applied techniques, methods, and tools in HIoT. Therefore, to determine the need for improving HIoT systems and introducing open issues and future trends, 146 studies are selected, categorized, and compared.

Here, the current study strategies, techniques, methods, best experiences, and practices used in HIoT are investigated. Additionally, this paper shows that studies in HIoT are growing rapidly and recognizes the need for using IoT in healthcare systems. In this regard, the outcomes of this SLR are impressive for the following cases:

•
Researchers in IoT and modern healthcare who need exploration of the related studies

•
Medical field experts interested in realizing the current methods, strategies, techniques, and tools with the existing constraints in HIoT systems

2. Background
In this section, a brief definition of IoT and healthcare is presented. At first, an outline of IoT and healthcare is explained. Then, the layered architecture of HIoT is described. Finally, the important metrics that are used in this subject are defined.

2.1. Internet of things
The term IoT was defined by Ashton (2009) in the supply management area for the first time in 1999. Nowadays, different definitions of the IoT can be addressed, such as a sophisticated network of addressable and identifiable things uniquely. These things connect to servers to transfer their data and extract valuable knowledge that efficiently provides appropriate services. In other words, the IoT consists of innumerable devices and objects, including various types of sensors and actuators, that connect and interact with each other through the Internet (Nikravan et al., 2011), (Atzori et al., 2010), (Najafizadeh and Kashani, 2011).

In addition, a typical IoT environment consists of communication interfaces, sensors, advanced algorithms, and cloud interfaces. Sensors are responsible for collecting data from various devices. Also, RFID technologies and WSN provide network and communication infrastructures (Fosso Wamba et al., 2013); advanced algorithms are used to analyze and process data. Numerous client/server requests can be exchanged in the cloud environment and allow the users to have access various types of services simultaneously (Asghari et al., 2019a), (Sultan, 2014). Due to cloud computing challenges such as latency, reliability, resource constraints, etc., fog computing is generated to overcome these limitations and run the same applications anywhere close to users with real-time analysis and efficient decision-making features (Farahani et al., 2018), (Sheikh Sofla et al., 2021).

Despite all improvements in IoT, this new paradigm is still in its infancy and has many research topics in various issues such as standardization, heterogeneity of different devices, scalability, security, privacy, and so forth. In this regard, interoperability among smart devices to communicate and interconnect heterogeneous devices and different vendor systems, which is easy to implement and cost-effective, is a particular issue (Jabbar et al., 2017). In addition, low-cost interoperability among smart objects is an essential aspect for IoT helping clients to continue working with different vendors in the near future. Finally, the IoT can reduce the cost of buildings, solve the complexity of organization infrastructures, and help support heterogeneous infrastructures (Ullah et al., 2017), (Najafizadeh et al., 2021).

Nowadays, the IoT paradigm covers various applications such as transport, smart cities, monitoring, healthcare, etc. Despite the heterogeneity of IoT devices, the data in IoT applications such as smart cities and smart homes are easily correlated, combined, and compared to be adapted to people's needs. For example, in the healthcare industry, with the emergence of the IoT paradigm, sanitary systems can be revolutionized by this technology. It can play an important role in telemonitoring at the hospital, especially at home for elderlies with chronic diseases. By using this technology, in the future, healthcare systems will experience major effects such as reduction of response time to detect anomalies, high-quality care, low hospitalization costs, and high life expectancy (Sakiz and Sen, 2017), (Ray et al., 2019a).

2.2. Healthcare
Given the current state of the world and the spread of the epidemic and infectious diseases such as COVID-19, along with other reasons related to this pandemic such as high cost, long-distance, and the need for quarantine in this critical period of time, going to medical centers is difficult and sometimes impossible for some (Singh et al., 2020), (Mohammed et al., 2020), (Kaur and Sharma, 2020) especially for the elderly and disabled ones most of whom suffer from at least one chronic disease. Therefore, a convenient, extensive, and computer-aided technology is crucial to satisfy the needs for long-term caring and remote medical monitoring to provide an appropriate quality of life for patients and to reduce the financial burden (Marengoniet al., 2011), (Nasajpour et al., 2020).

IoT has revolutionized the sanitary system by analyzing big data and has developed it into a predictive and intelligent system by connecting many IoT devices to capture real-time physiological data of patients such as glucose levels in the blood, temperature monitors, and other required data. The main goal is to provide novel medical services for patients, such as early detection of diseases and continuous monitoring of serious ones. Indeed, the IoT can help the healthcare industry in such cases as preventative care, disease management, assisted living, and clinical monitoring remotely. Furthermore, the most common IoT applications in healthcare are in some areas such as home healthcare, mobile healthcare or e-healthcare, hospital management, and etc. (Ahmadi et al., 2018), (Dey et al., 2018). Finally, the convergence of IoT and healthcare systems has enabled smart management of the healthcare processes, self-caring, detection of some events such as seizure detection, fall detection to help Parkinson's gait disturbance, stroke rehabilitation, neurologic monitoring, and cardiac to reduce medication and human errors. However, more challenges still exist to achieve effective and secure healthcare applications such as self-improvement, self-learning, and hardware systems (e.g., implantable sensors and wearables), privacy, security, and standardization. Today, there are various security protocols to protect data from attacks or threats, including authentication, and encryption techniques, public-key cryptosystems, k-anonymity, etc. (Wilson, 2017), (Ahmed et al., 2018).

According to Fig. 3, the HIoT system has a well-known classic four-layer architecture, including the perception layer, networking layer, middleware layer, and application/business layer, which is illustrated in Fig. 3 (Qi et al., 2017). The explanations of the layers are as follows (Ashton, 2009), (Qi et al., 2017), (Wu et al., 2010), (Vilela et al., 2019):

•
Perception layer: This layer is at the bottom of the other layers that can be attended as the physical or hardware layer. Data collection and signaling are performed in this layer, then prepared data will be sent to the network layer.

•
Network layer: This layer aims to connect all smart devices together and allow them to transfer health data and exchange among themselves. This layer transmits the health data securely from patients to the base station via Zigbee, Bluetooth, infrared, Wi-Fi technologies, and so on.

•
Middleware layer: This layer includes service with its requester related to names and addresses. The HIoT application programmers can work with non-homogeneous objects with no attention to a specific equipment platform. Health data is gathered from the network layer and stored in a database via this layer.

•
Application/Business layer: This layer procures healthcare services that evaluate and integrate the data received from other layers. This layer can provide high-quality healthcare services to satisfy patients' requests. The achievements of HIoT systems will rely on the importance of applied innovations, technologies, and proper business models; therefore, this layer is responsible for managing all activities and healthcare services through creating graphs, business models, and flowcharts.

Fig. 3. The architecture of IoT in healthcare systems (Ashton, 2009), (Vilela et al., 2019).

Also, three major steps, including i) data generation, ii) data processing, and iii) information consuming, can be considered as three main phases of a workflow in a general healthcare system constructed in an IoT-based architecture which is known as HIoT systems. The mentioned phases are described as follows:

i)
Data generation: Data generation phase comprises collecting and generating the needed data by various sensors, medical devices, and even direct data entry by patients or involved healthcare teams. This phase is performed through the perception layer, and the collected data is transferred via the network layer.

ii)
Data processing: Data processing phase implies the analysis of generated data through some well-known mechanisms such as machine learning methods by means of data analysis tools. This phase is performed through the middleware layer.

iii)
Information consuming: The outcomes and analytics of the data processing phase can be used in the information consuming phase for any required decision-making performed by medical teams for patients, and even this analytical information can be used for activating the actuators. This phase is performed through the application and business layer.

For further clarification, the above-mentioned phases are illustrated in a four-layer architecture of IoT in healthcare systems in Fig. 3. As shown in this figure, the vital signs of the user are obtained from wearable sensors. Then, obtained data are transferred to the smartphone via a connection like infrared. Eventually, the mobile device forwards this information to the database server (DB) through the network, such as the emerging 5G network. DB collects data from the sensors or the patient's announcement by pressing a button instantly. Other data are collected from health centers, including doctors' decisions and medical analytics, and are stored in the DB. Then, the system analyzes the stored data in the DB; afterward, the intelligent engine determines if normal data or abnormal data has taken place. When the system detects an abnormal situation, an alarm will be sent to the patient or doctor, and by approving the alarm, the patient will be hospitalized. Finally, with the increased demand to focus on recent advances in health systems and digital communications, patients can now connect to remote healthcare services anywhere, taking the highest sense of choice and customizing healthcare services.

2.3. Metrics definition
This section defines the metrics used to evaluate the proposed HIoT approaches, in brief as follows (Dhanvijay and Patil, 2019), (Asghari et al., 2018), (Bazzaz Abkenar et al., 2020a):

•
Security and privacy: Security and privacy in smart healthcare systems are crucial, and some activities should be performed to protect health data against some attacks like side-channel attacks, physical attacks, malicious attacks, and preserve privacy, and prevent unauthorized access to health data (Cutillo et al., 2010).

•
Accuracy: In healthcare systems, accuracy is very critical for caregivers. In IoT based healthcare systems, accuracy, based on the usage of the system, refers to the degree to which the captured data represents the real condition of the patient, the degree of captured data correctness and completeness, to the degree of computation correctness, and to what extent the taken decision is correct (Hogan and Wagner, 1997).

•
Performance: Performance is serious for healthcare providers to collect accurate data, process the data, and provide services efficiently. This parameter is a mixture of network QoS parameters such as throughput, latency, delivery rate, mean time between failures, bandwidth usage, and other parameters like efficiency, load balancing, resource utilization, overhead, and computational time (as referred to in the reviewed papers) (Manishankar et al., 2017).

•
Time: This parameter refers to how long it takes for users to receive service whenever requested. The concept of time includes execution time as run-time, computational time, average response time, and latency as the time delay in healthcare systems (Haghi Kashani et al., 2020a).

•
Cost: It refers to the total cost that a healthcare service requester should pay to receive the best services. It includes the price of computation, communications, data storage, and maintaining the requested service (Bazzaz Abkenar et al., 2020a).

•
Energy: Since the HIoT objects are resource-constrained and powered with limited energy resources, energy saving is vital to device and network survivability. Additionally, by growing the number of connected HIoT devices to the HIoT network, energy consumption in the HIoT network also increases. On the other hand, more energy consumption leads to an increase in operational costs and carbon production and decreases network lifetime (Jiang et al., 2020).

•
Interoperability: Interoperability is the ability of two or more HIoT systems (for example, two or more medical informatics systems) to communicate, to exchange information accurately, consistently, and effectively, to use the information that has been exchanged, and to share resources between different systems (Dogac et al., 2007). Data interoperability is the ability to interpret data across systems or organizational boundaries correctly (Renner, 2001). In HIoT systems, it is mandatory to use standardized communication and some other technologies that support interoperability, like web services, clinical document architecture (CDA), and cloud computing.

•
Scalability: It refers to the ability to extend and develop an IoT-based healthcare system when the number of service requests and demands increase. This ability can add smart devices, new operations as the service nodes for users', and network infrastructures without any reduction in the quality and performance of healthcare services. Expanding the system could be performed by adding new hardware or services to the system or by increasing the capability of the existing hardware or services (Chen et al., 2014).

•
Reliability: The ability of a system to perform its required tasks in defined conditions and specified time. The aim of reliability in IoT-based healthcare systems is to deliver requested services successfully to the patients in most times and conditions (Bazzaz Abkenar et al., 2020a).

3. Related work and motivation

3.1.1. Surveys
Farahani et al. (Farahani et al., 2018) attempted to show an evolution from the clinic-based to the patient-based IoT healthcare systems. Furthermore, a holistic multi-layer IoT healthcare architecture was designed comprising devices, fog, and cloud layers to change traditional health systems to intelligent health systems. On the other hand, some important applications and services were described, such as mobile-health, anomaly detection, early warning score, ambient assisted living, as well as two case studies that were implemented, including intelligent eyeglasses for unobtrusive with constant heart rate monitoring with smart gloves in IoT for Parkinson disease. Additionally, challenges and barriers of this field were listed, such as data management, scalability, security, privacy, interoperability, and standardization. However, this review was not conducted systematically, and the process of articles selection, taxonomy, future works, and the covered years of the reviewed papers were not considered.

Darwish et al. (Darwish et al., 2017) introduced cloud computing and the IoT paradigm, called cloud IoT-health. In this survey, the authors explained the history of IoT and cloud computing and their applications in healthcare systems in detail, then incorporated them as a new technology to be used in healthcare systems. After that, some challenges and obstacles were defined in this scope, such as standardization, storage, scalability, and flexibility. Despite the appropriate explanations of this study, this review was not systematic, the paper selection process was not clear, no taxonomy of the selected papers was provided, and the covered years of the reviewed papers were unspecified.

Qi et al. (Qi et al., 2017) presented a study on advanced IoT that enabled personalized healthcare systems. In this investigation, a four-layer architecture including sensing, network, data processing, and application layers was designed, and all technologies used in these layers were explained in detail. Additionally, the authors discussed the challenges to motivate researchers for their future works. However, this survey was not systematic, and the paper selection process was not clear. Moreover, no taxonomy of the studied papers was provided, and the covered years of reviewed papers were not defined.

Qi et al. (Qi et al., 2018) illustrated a physical activity recognition and monitoring architecture in IoT layer-based perspective and expanded their scheme in four layers. In addition, future trends were described for researchers. However, contrary to the title of the article, this review was not conducted systematically. Also, there was not a unique selection process of studied articles or any classifications to give a clear vision to readers. Moreover, published papers in 2019 and 2020 were not considered. Also, Dhanvijay and Patil (2019) presented a survey that reviewed the latest important technologies and their applicabilities in IoT healthcare systems. Especially, they concentrated on WBAN and its security aspects. Moreover, there was a technology-based classification to give a clear vision to researchers. Also, some challenges have been addressed to extend this topic as future works. But, this investigation was not systematic, the process of selecting papers was not specific, and the covered years of papers were not mentioned.

Habibzadeh et al. (Habibzadeh et al., 2020) summarized the existing technologies in clinical practice healthcare, especially in three fields of sensing, communications, and analytics. Moreover, some important trends, challenges, and application demands were addressed. Afterward, the authors presented their supposed architecture, describing each layer, and trendy study directions as future works. Further, Alam, et al. (Alam et al., 2018) explored the key application-based requirements from the vision of communication-based technologies in HIoT. Also, some emerging technologies and standards used in this field were explained with different scenarios. Additionally, some future trends and challenges were highlighted for the future of HIoT. But, in these two surveys, investigations were not created systematically, the process of paper selection was not clear, and the taxonomy and covered years of studied papers were not specified.

Ray et al. (Ray et al., 2019b) reviewed the existing standards and solutions for the edge/IoT. Also, the authors suggested an architecture based on edge computing with its requirements, capabilities, functionalities, and operational issues. Then, there was a comparison between cloud computing and edge computing in HIoT in terms of latency and bandwidth utilization criteria to give an idea as future works for researchers. Furthermore, a taxonomy of industrial edge-IoT computing was defined. But, this paper was not systematic, the process of paper selection was not clear, and the covered years of this survey were not specified. Qadri et al. (Qadri et al., 2020) provided an overview of HIoT structure, and then, based on different use cases, various architectures were presented. Moreover, a large number of technologies that were appropriate for the future of HIoT, such as machine learning, blockchain, big data, edge computing, and software-defined network (SDN), were explored and analyzed. Also, two other technologies including the tactile Internet (TI) and Internet of nano things (IoNT) were suggested as future works. Furthermore, a taxonomy of emerging technologies, based on the quality of service (QoS), security and privacy, and diagnostic systems, was introduced. But, this review was not systematic, the method of paper selection was not distinctive, and the covered years of selected papers were not specified.

Somasundaram and Thirugnanam (2020) reviewed security issues, different risk factors of security attacks, and counter solutions related to the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The study showed that providing device-level security is necessary, and simultaneously, communication-level security has occurred on a moderate level. The experimental results showed that in IoMT, the DDoS attack and authentication issue in wireless insulin pump are harmful comparing with other security vulnerabilities with 95 % and 55 % risk factor, respectively. However, this review was not conducted systematically, and the paper selection process with the taxonomy, future works, and the covered years of published papers was not considered. Kadhim et al. (Kadhim et al., 2020) reviewed the Internet-based healthcare monitoring systems, explored the uses of IoT applications in the medical sector, and how much it can enrich traditional medical methods, highlighting the extent of IoT ability of medical care services quality by having accurate diagnoses for patients. Moreover, the study helps to decreases periodic patient reviews to the hospital using IoT applications for remote diagnosis. However, they proposed a descriptive research approach, and this review was not conducted systematically, and the paper selection process with the taxonomy, future works, and the covered years of published papers were not considered.

3.1.2. SLRs
Ahmed et al. (Ahmed et al., 2018) reviewed the top existing security techniques and security threats used to systematically prevent malicious insider attacks and their applications in the HIoT and multi-cloud-based smart healthcare environment. Based on this survey, 60 % of all cyber-attacks were carried out by insiders. However, the published papers between 2018 and 2020 were not considered. Also, Ahmadi, et al. (Ahmadi et al., 2018) presented a systematic review of IoT in healthcare systems. In addition, the selected articles were categorized by a specified taxonomy comprising home health, m-health, e-health, and hospital management. Moreover, they described the application areas, applied technologies, and protocols in HIoT. Moreover, four communication models were introduced to explain how objects communicate with one another in different scenarios. Additionally, the distribution of articles by the publication year, application area, and journal or conference types were depicted. In the authors’ view, standardization and interoperability were the main defects and limitations of the IoT in healthcare. However, the published papers between 2017 and 2020 were not addressed.

Saheb and Izadi (2019) presented a qualitative and quantitative systematic review on HIoT fog computing and big data analytics in detail. Additionally, they addressed some challenges as future directions for other researchers. However, published papers in 2019 and 2020 were not reviewed. Usak et al. (Usak et al., 2020) presented an SLR on the IoT‐based health care service delivery, surveyed relevant articles, and provided a taxonomy of them, including the pharmaceutical industry, monitoring, and E-health categories. The selected papers were compared using some factors such as efficiency, energy savings, accuracy, speed, personal innovativeness, security, flexibility, quality, cost, and monitoring. The authors comparatively analyzed the advantages, drawbacks, and main challenges of current mechanisms, and produced results to develop much efficient IoT‐based mechanisms in the future. The results showed that most of the papers aimed to improve remote monitoring, cost, and efficiency, whereas the security issue was less considered. However, the proposed SLR exclusively focused on service delivery issue while another studies exist over different related subjects such as economic, social, urban intelligence communities, which would be worth considering them by future studies. In addition, the published papers between 2019 and 2020 were not considered.

Zou et al. (Zou et al., 2020) reviewed the papers focused on people interacting with the HIoT data, highlighted various critical issues related to this concept, and discussed the data challenges which make difficult HIoT development. They categorized reviewed studies into three important HIoT data types and seven important HIoT end-user groups. However, the reviewed sample data and data extraction are somewhat inaccurate and published papers after 2018 were not considered. Also, Santos, et al. (Santos et al., 2020) analyzed the studies focused on online monitoring, detection, and support of the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. In addition, they studied how to address the security issues and provided a reference model to assist future developers in exploring the necessary factors to develop an online heart monitoring system prototype. Moreover, they presented an evaluating study to specify which electrocardiography (ECG) or photoplethysmography (PPG) technologies is the best to be developed. However, they just focused on cardiovascular diseases, and published papers from 2018 to 2020 were not considered.

3.1.3. Concluding remark
None of the previously SLRs (Ahmadi et al., 2018), (Saheb and Izadi, 2019), (Ahmed et al., 2018), (Usak et al., 2020), (Zou et al., 2020), (Santos et al., 2020) have investigated the IoT-based healthcare systems comprehensively. Saheb and Izadi (2019) studied big data in HIoT until 2018. Ahmed et al. (Ahmed et al., 2018) focused on the security issue in HIoT until 2017. Usak et al. (Usak et al., 2020) focused on service delivery in HIoT and the covered years were between 2010 and 2018. Zou et al. (Zou et al., 2020) investigated user and data interaction in HIoT, and they reviewed the studies between 2018 and 2019 that seem to be insufficient. Santos et al. (Santos et al., 2020) reviewed papers related to heart monitoring systems using IoT environment. However, the covered years were between 2015 and 2018. Ahmadi et al. (Ahmadi et al., 2018) is the closest work to ours; however, the covered years were until 2016. In consequence, we believe that our SLR is the first attempt to explore HIoT systems comprehensively until 2020.

3.2. The motivations for a secondary study on HIoT
The motivation of conducting an SLR is identification, classification, and evaluation of the existing approaches in HIoT. It mainly puts emphasis on classification and comparison of the existing methods in this field. To show that no comprehensive SLR has been reported until 2020, we searched Google Scholar with the following search string:

(healthcare <OR> health <OR> e-Health).

[AND]

(“Internet of Things” <OR> IoT).

[AND]

(survey <OR> review <OR> overview <OR> study <OR> challenges <OR> “state of the art” <OR> trends).

Most of the studied review papers up to 2020 did not provide any analytical and taxonomic classifications to shed light on the open challenges. A summary of the studied reviews is presented in Table 1, which shows the reviews' parameters, including review type, main topic, publication year, paper selection process, taxonomy, open issue, and covered year for each study. It is observed that only one paper (Ahmadi et al., 2018) has applied the SLR method to study IoT in healthcare explicitly between 2000 and 2016, and the others used the SLR method to review security, big data, service delivery, data interaction, and heart monitoring in HIoT; additionally, they have covered fewer years (See Section 3.1.3). Therefore, our study is the first paper that has used an SLR method to explore IoT in healthcare systems until 2020. Due to the cases mentioned above, a comprehensive investigation has been carried out to cover the following disadvantages:

•
The organization of some reviews was not systematic in HIoT, and the paper selection process was not clear.

•
Some surveys reviewed the selected papers without providing any analytical classifications in HIoT.

•
Open issues in HIoT were not discussed in some of the reviews.

•
Most of the published articles, especially in 2019 and 2020, were not considered.

•
Some articles had not studied evaluation metrics in HIoT.

•
Some other articles had not mentioned the evaluation tools.

4. Research method
Contrary to an unstructured review process, the SLR method was applied to reduce bias and to follow a rigorous and precise sequence of methodological phases to research literature. An SLR depends on the well-defined review protocol to extract, evaluate, and document results (KitchenhamKeele, 2004; Jamshidi et al., 2013; Haghi Kashani et al., 2020b; Songhorabadi et al., 2020; Bazzaz Abkenar et al., 2020b), as depicted in Fig. 4. Then, an SLR method that includes planning, conducting, and documenting is applied. The review is completed by an external evaluation for the consequences of each phase. A summary of the planning and conducting phases used to perform this SLR is presented in this section. Afterward, the results are reported in terms of data summary in Section 6 and research implications and findings in Section 7.

Fig. 4. An overview of our research methodology.

4.1. Planning the systematic review
Planning begins with the identification of the motivations for an SLR method and results in a review protocol as follows:

Stage 1. Identifying the motivations for the systematic review: The motivation is addressed and the contribution of this systematic review is described in Section 3.2.

Stage 2. Defining the research questions: The RQs that are based on our motivations and responses provide an evidence-based overview of HIoT systems. In this regard, four research questions that present the basis of deriving the search method for selecting articles are specified. The main objective of the research for each question is provided by the motivations that are shown in Table 2. Further, a comparative analysis that helps us to consider the importance of this research is presented as an analysis of the results in Section 6.


Table 2. Research questions and the motivations.

Research Questions	Rationales
RQ1: What are the major practical motivations behind associating IoT in healthcare systems?	The purpose is to gain insight into what are the primary reasons for applying IoT in healthcare systems.
RQ2: What research scopes do exist in IoT-based healthcare systems? Besides, what achievements are there in this area?	The purpose is to have a perception of what research scopes are available in HIoT and what are the merits and demerits of each.
RQ3: What are the existing techniques and methods to enable IoT in healthcare systems?	The purpose is to identify and compare existing factors, techniques, and tools that support HIoT.

Table 3. Research criteria.

Criteria
Inclusion	1. Research articles that present solutions, experiences, or evaluation of HIoT
2. Research articles from 2015 to 2020
3. JCR-indexed journal articles
Exclusion	1. Research articles that do not explicitly discuss HIoT
2. Books, book chapters, conference papers, symposiums, and non-English scripts
3. Commentaries or review articles
4. Short articles (less than six papers)
Stage 3. Defining and evaluating the review protocol: Up to this point, we specified the RQs and the study scope to adjust search terms for research extraction. In addition, a review protocol to achieve a systematic study was applied based on our experience with SLRs (Haghi Kashani et al., 2020a), (Asghari et al., 2019a), (Asghari et al., 2018), (Bazzaz Abkenar et al., 2020a), (Rahimi et al., 2020), (Bazzaz Abkenar et al., 2020a), (Ahmadi et al., 2021). A pilot study of the SLR, with 20 percent of our studies, is conducted to evaluate this method. Reducing the bias among researchers is the principal aim of this pilot study. Therefore, the search strategies, review scope, and refined inclusion/exclusion criteria are improved.

4.2. Conducting the systematic review
The conducting phase includes article selection, the outcome in extracted data, and information synthesizing.

Stage 1. Selecting primary articles: In this step, we explored the search string of.

(healthcare <OR> health <OR> e-Health) [AND] (IoT <OR> “Internet of Things”)

through Google Scholar as the main search engine based on popular academic publishers such as ACM, Emerald, Hindawi, IEEE, Inderscience, SAGE, Science Direct, Springer, Taylor and Francis, and Wiley. Additionally, the paper selection process is illustrated in Fig. 5, as follows:

•
Initial selection: This step includes filtering the titles, abstracts, and keywords of potential primary articles. This stage resulted from 1343 articles, including conference papers, journals, chapters, books, symposiums, and other types of literature that were part of this search term. The search string was applied to address digital databases from 2015 to 2020.

•
Final selection: Table 3 shows the inclusion/exclusion criteria used to include relevant articles and exclude irrelevant ones. Due to the wide range of literature on HIoT systems and despite the acquired reputed conference articles, only journal citation reports (JCR)-indexed articles were considered. Moreover, full-text evaluation and analysis of the JCRs were performed in the final selection stage to select related journals about HIoT. We retrieved 146 related JCR-indexed journal articles.

Stage 2 and 3. Data extraction and synthesis: We obtained data from a list of mentioned online search databases and designed a structural format based on aspects of characterization, using the guidelines provided by (Brereton et al., 2007), (KitchenhamKeele, 2004). We compared the proposed approaches for HIoT in Section 5, analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of the existing researches in Section 6, and presented future trends in Section 7.

5. Taxonomy for IoT-based healthcare systems
In this section, 146 retrieved journal articles are discussed. Furthermore, their main idea, evaluation techniques, tools, advantages, and disadvantages are explained. Since the literature on HIoT is widely diverse, systematic arranging of relevant studies is difficult. According to the studies on relevant investigations as researchers’ challenges, our classification was natural. Based on the efforts made to review papers, some of them were found to be under the same umbrella covering the sensor-based approaches, and the remainders were resource-based, communication-based, application-based, and security-based perspectives. Therefore, the presented approaches in this review have been classified into five main distinct categories shown in Fig. 6, while other classifications could be possible. All approaches have been reviewed and summarized in Sections 5.1 Sensor-based approaches, 5.2 Resource-based approaches.

Fig. 6. A taxonomy of the selected articles in IoT-based healthcare.

5.1. Sensor-based approaches
Reviewing the articles showed that some of the literature emphasized the sensors and medical devices in HIoT and could be divided into two categories, including wearable sensors and environmental sensors. The selected sensor-based articles are reviewed in Section 5.1.1. A summary of the retrieved information from studied papers and a comparison between them are discussed in Section 5.1.2.

5.1.1. An overview of the selected sensor-based approaches
In this section, we study sensor-based articles, including wearable sensors and environmental sensors.

5.1.1.1. Wearable sensors
This subsection reviews the articles related to wearable sensor including (Ray et al., 2019c), (Bhatia and Sood, 2017), (Azimi et al., 2019), (Yang et al., 2016), (Wu et al., 2017), (Wu et al., 2018), (Niitsuet al., 2018), (Tekeste et al., 2019), (Hallforset al., 2018), (Esmaeili et al., 2020), (Muthuet al., 2020), (Huifeng et al., 2020), (Wu et al., 2020).

Ray et al. (Ray et al., 2019c) proposed wearable and cost-effective galvanic skin response (GSR) system to detect an individual's level of human physiological activities by amplifying, acquiring, and processing GSR data in smart e-healthcare applications. In addition, the obtained data were shown in users' smartphones with low power consumption. However, security and privacy requirements were ignored. Bhatia and Sood (2017) illustrated an intelligent healthcare framework to provide ubiquitous healthcare during people's workout sessions by analyzing real-time health conditions obtained from gyms through people's wristband, and to predict health state vulnerabilities using an artificial neural network (ANN). The results of experiments showed that the proposed system has high performance and efficiency. Azimi et al. (Azimi et al., 2019) presented personalized missing data resilient decision-making method to deliver health decisions. They used a case study on pregnant women to monitor their maternal health via their wristband and proved that their model was more accurate when the missing window was large. However, security and privacy issues were ignored. Further, Yang, et al. (Yang et al., 2016) presented a portable and wearable system for long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) signal detection system with low cost, high accuracy, and reliability. The experimental results showed suitable system accuracy and reliability. The main defect of these two papers is lack of security and privacy issues to satisfy the security requirements of the system.

In another research, Wu, et al. (Wu et al., 2017) offered a wearable sensor-based system with solar energy harvesting to extend the lifetime of sensor nodes and the Bluetooth low power transmission. This system enabled the implementation of an autonomous WBAN for IoT to measure the body's temperature distribution and heartbeat to detect falls. However, this study lacked security and privacy requirements. Wu et al. (Wu et al., 2018) presented a wireless implantable sensor prototype with flexible subcutaneous solar energy harvesting as a self-powered system that was able to restart in battery discharge conditions. Although the prototype incorporated Bluetooth low energy module and temperature sensor, the security was ignored.

Niitsu et al. (Niitsuet al., 2018) suggested a self-powered disposable supply-sensing biosensor platform using an organic biofuel cell for big data-based healthcare applications in IoT, which was environmentally friendly and had high performance. Tekeste et al. (Tekeste et al., 2019) introduced a real-time QRS (Q, R, and S are waves on an ECG line) detector and an ECG compression architecture for energy consumption for IoT healthcare wearable devices. Moreover, the experimental results showed high sensitivity and predictivity of the suggested architecture. However, security and privacy were ignored. Hallfors et al. (Hallforset al., 2018), on the other hand, introduced the characterization, fabrication, and validation of composite fabric ECG self-powered wearable IoT-based sensors that were made of nylon with reduced graphene oxide (rGOx). Based on the experimental results, the rGOx showed high performance in terms of noise level for ECG signal amplitudes.

Further, Esmaeili, et al. (Esmaeili et al., 2020) proposed a secure lightweight sensing scheme for body area networks that labels patients' data based on a priority mechanism and offers the services to emergency patients with low delay. Muthu et al. (Muthuet al., 2020) designed IoT-connected wearable sensors empowered with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, which predict diseases, inform patients, and provide treatments. Huifeng et al. (Huifeng et al., 2020) presented IoT-based wearable sensors and machine learning that continually collects the health parameters and traces the exercises to monitor the sport person's health condition. Wu et al. (Wu et al., 2020) designed a compact wearable sensor patch to measure various physiological parameters such as ECG, PPG, and body temperature that facilitates remote health monitoring providing security and privacy.

5.1.1.2. Environmental sensors
The articles related to environmental sensors, including (Vilela et al., 2019), (Ray et al., 2019d), (Elstset al., 2018), and (Chen et al., 2018), are reviewed as follows:

Vilela et al. (Vilela et al., 2019) introduced a fog-assisted health monitoring system for real-time applications and used it in the hospital as a scenario to prove its high performance and security. However, the interoperability among heterogonous devices was a big challenge in this study. Ray et al. (Ray et al., 2019d) prototyped a non-invasive, low power, and cost-effective sensor system to monitor real-time intravenous (IV) fluid bag level in e-healthcare applications. By using this application, caregivers could monitor the IV fluid bag's status on the web page to see whether it was about to get empty.

Moreover, Elsts, et al. (Elstset al., 2018) suggested a multi-modal platform called SPHERE and used it in smart home application to reduce power consumption and cost to monitor people in residential environments. The authors explained that the network architecture embraced software and hardware requirements in SPHERE. Finally, Chen, et al. (Chen et al., 2018) proposed three algorithms to improve packet size and power management selection in e-health WSNs. These three algorithms were compared with one another in terms of performance, latency, reliability, and lifetime.

5.1.2. A summary of sensor-based approaches
Sensor-based approaches focus on the aspects of medical devices and sensors in two categories, including wearable sensors and environmental sensors that are responsible for measuring vital signs of patients’ bodies. The proposed approaches along with their main ideas, evaluation techniques, tools, benefits, and weaknesses, are explored in Table 4. Moreover, a comparison of proposed approaches in terms of security, accuracy, performance, reliability, time, cost, and energy is shown in Table 5.

5.2. Resource-based approaches
Due to the resource heterogeneity, resource limitations, dynamic nature, and unpredictability of the HIoT environment, it is crucial to consider resource management issues as one of the challenging problems. In Section 5.2.1, some resource-based articles that focused on scheduling, resource allocation, offloading, load balancing, and provisioning are studied. Afterward, in Section 5.2.2 the evaluation techniques and positive and negative points of the studied articles are presented.

5.2.1. An overview of the selected resource-based approaches
Reviewing the selected resource-based articles showed that they could be divided into five subcategories, including scheduling, resource allocation, offloading, load balancing, and provisioning.

5.2.1.1. Scheduling
Scheduling approaches, including three types of dynamic methods (Ray et al., 2019a), (Abdelmoneem et al., 2020), hybrid method (Yi and Cai, 2019), and static methods (Awanet al., 2019), (Manikandan et al., 2020), are explained in this subsection.

Ray et al. (Ray et al., 2019a) investigated three possible solutions where IoT could benefit from the real-time effects. Moreover, the authors presented a context-aware dew computing-based architecture for time-critical scenarios along with a delay-tolerant architecture for dynamic scheduling different tasks on resources. Abdelmoneem et al. (Abdelmoneem et al., 2020) proposed heuristic-based mobility-aware scheduling and allocation method that dynamically distributes tasks of healthcare systems on fog or cloud computational nodes based on patient movement, thereby provides load balancing. In addition, Yi and Cai (2019) proposed a scheduling management model to decrease the delay of medical packet transmission in HIoT systems. This model prevented gateways from misreporting the priority level of medical packets. Awan et al. (Awanet al., 2019) designed a priority-based congestion-avoidance routing protocol to enhance energy efficiency in multi-hop WBANs in HIoT systems. Additionally, the high performance of this protocol was proved in terms of stability, traffic load, lifetime, delay, throughput, optimization, and energy consumption. However, the mobility of sensor nodes was ignored in these studies, and the lack of security aspects seems to be the main shortcoming of them. Manikandan et al. (Manikandan et al., 2020) proposed a hash-based polynomial method that classifies the patients’ data based on their health condition (normal or critical) and then efficiently schedules them to be processed.

5.2.1.2. Resource allocation
The articles focused on resource allocation including (Asif-Ur-Rahmanet al., 2019), (Kavitha and Sharma, 2019), (Sengupta and Bhunia, 2020), and (Awaisi et al., 2020), are reviewed as follows:

Asif-Ur-Rahman et al. (Asif-Ur-Rahmanet al., 2019) offered a real-time heterogeneous HIoT framework along with employing SDN and link adaptation. Additionally, this framework focused on optimal and efficient resource utilization and resource allocation. Simulation proved that this framework has high QoS, low packet loss, and end-to-end latency. However, the framework suffers from high complexity and a lack of security. Kavitha and Sharma (2019) replaced the default first-come-first-serve virtual machine allocation scheme with an ant colony optimization (ACO) scheme to show how ACO could optimally utilize resources in the cloud and decrease response time in life-critical healthcare applications. However, the security and scalability of the scheme were not considered. Sengupta and Bhunia (2020), using cloudlet and IoT, proposed a data management scheme that facilitates real-time store and retrieval of enormous e-Health data, thereby improves energy consumption, response time, and packet loss. Awaisi et al. (Awaisi et al., 2020) used the virtual machine partitioning concept in fog nodes to propose an efficient architecture based on fog for healthcare systems and exploited elliptic curve cryptography for user authentication.

5.2.1.3. Offloading, load balancing, and provisioning
Other resource-based approaches, including offloading (Minet al., 2019), (Wang and Li, 2020), (Wang and Cai, 2020), load balancing (He et al., 2017), (Bharathiet al., 2020), and provisioning (Kumar and Silambarasan, 2019), are described in this subsection.

Min et al. (Minet al., 2019) presented a privacy-aware scheme to help IoT healthcare devices to protect their privacy, using the reinforcement-learning method. Indeed, this scheme helps HIoT devices select the offloading rate, improves computation performance, reduces latency, protects users’ privacy, and saves devices' energy. Wang and Li (2020) leveraged fog computing capabilities in terms of in-network caching and request aggregation to reduce the latency of patient data retrieval; thereby, the latency was reduced by nearly 28.5 %. Wang and Cai (2020) combined IoT, Name Data Networking (NDN), and edge cloud to design a secure and efficient data management scheme that improves medical data storage and retrieval.

Further, He, et al. (He et al., 2017) proposed a proactive hierarchical fog-cloud computing for complex event processing architecture to deal with the complexity of personalized services in large-scale applications. To this end, the graph partitioning theory was used to design load balancing algorithm of fog computing. Additionally, efficiency, real-time detection, low latency, and redundancy were validated in this scheme. Bharathi et al. (Bharathiet al., 2020) presented an energy-efficient sensor clustering technique to effectively select cluster heads. They tried to optimize parameters such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F-score, and energy consumption. Finally, three resource optimization methods for virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud system, including the Cuckoo search method, artificial bee colony (ABC), and particle swarm optimization, were introduced by Kumar and Silambarasan (2019) to schedule resources. Simulation results showed that the ABC was more efficient than the other two techniques.

5.2.2. A summary of resource-based approaches
Resource-based approaches focus on resource management issues. These approaches include five subcategories: scheduling, resource allocation, offloading, load balancing, and provisioning. The resource-based articles along with main ideas, assessment techniques, tools, merits, and demerits, are shown in Table 6. In addition, a comparison of some metrics like optimization, performance, reliability, time, and energy, is shown in Table 7.

5.3. Communication-based approaches
The next group of classification refers to the communication-based methods. This section addresses communication infrastructures that are responsible for managing communications, including technological and algorithmic approaches. In Section 5.3.1, related articles and their communication technologies and algorithms are studied. Then, some obtained information about the given articles, such as evaluation techniques, benefits, and limitations, is presented in Section 5.3.2.

5.3.1. An overview of the selected communication-based approaches

5.4. Application-based approaches
In the next category, the application-based approach focuses on providing systems that can perform one or more specific services. In other words, an IoT-based healthcare system, beyond its sensor aspects, resource management, and communication infrastructure, produces the required services to patients, caregivers, or users. In this regard, the application-based category is divided into two sub-categories, including the monitoring systems and recommender systems. Moreover, the application-based articles are reviewed in Section 5.4.1, and the comparison of them is presented in Section 5.4.2.

Experimental results verified the security, stability, and practicability of the suggested system. Kumar et al. (Kumar et al., 2018) proposed a cloud/IoT-based mobile healthcare application to monitor, diagnose, and predict serious diseases. Additionally, they suggested a classification algorithm (fuzzy rule-based neural classifier) to decide on the medical dataset and diagnose the diabetes disease. Finally, the authors compared this algorithm with other existing models to validate it in terms of performance, security, and response time. However, this framework was vulnerable to some attacks related to advanced encryption standard (AES) and data encryption standard (DES) techniques.

Sood and Mahajan (2019) suggested a fog/IoT-based healthcare monitoring system to control hypertension disease. Additionally, ANN (artificial neural network) was applied to predict the risk level of hypertension, and the system was compared with cloud computing technology to prove its high bandwidth efficiency, low latency, and high accuracy in response time. Verma et al.

However, energy consumption in the sensor network was not optimized.

Jebadurai and Dinesh Peter (Jebadurai and Dinesh Peter, 2018) presented hybrid architecture to process retinal images captured through smartphone in IoT healthcare systems. In addition, a learning-based single image super-resolution algorithm was used to improve the quality of the captured images for efficient detection. Khowaja et al. (Khowaja et al., 2018) proposed a fall and stress detection framework by applying some lightweight authentication protocols to collect the data securely based on contextual activity from wearable sensors; however, the energy consumption issue was ignored.

Tuli et al. (Tuliet al., 2020) suggested a fog-based system in HIoT to detect heart diseases automatically using deep learning called healthfog.

Alhussein et al. (Alhussein et al., 2018) presented a cloud-based cognitive HIoT framework to detect seizure by using deep convolutional neural networks and the stacked autoencoder method. The framework is applicable in real-time emergencies with high accuracy and high sensitivity; however, security and privacy issues were ignored.

Rajan et al. (Rajan et al., 2020) presented an image pattern analysis along with an improved pixel distribution-based filter scheme in HIoT systems. A deep convolutional neural network was used to identify the oral cancer regions. The scheme increased accuracy and sensitivity in real-time scenarios, but security and privacy were ignored. Ray et al. (Ray et al., 2018) suggested an IoT-based mathematical model detect, monitor, and approximate fruit ripening quality index. Based on this research, 100 apples were selected to measure their ripening in a low-cost manner. In addition, there was a mathematical model for real-time fruit index measurement with cost-efficiency. This research was useful for the food industry and human health.

Rahmani et al. (Rahmaniet al., 2018) introduced a fog computing-based architecture that could cope with some challenges in healthcare systems. In addition, they suggested smart geo-distributed gateways to end-users and sensors at the edge of the network to optimize the resources. Moreover, the healthcare monitoring system includes a suggested gateway applied in a medical case study to estimate the degree of illness in long-term caring. Laplante et al.

The system was compared to other similar systems to prove appropriate security, reliability, and scalability. Rajan Jeyaraj and Nadar (Rajan Jeyaraj and Nadar, 2019) designed an automatic physiological smart signal monitoring system. In addition to monitoring the patients for a long time, the authors applied estimation algorithms and deep neural network-based signal prediction to increase the prediction accuracy in smart monitoring. However, security and scalability were ignored.

Laplante et al. (Laplante et al., 2018) designed a systematic method to begin the process of eliciting requirements for an HIoT-based care system and to support emergency room activities at hospitals. They showed that this method could be generalized to identify boundaries and stakeholders for a broader HIoT application covering the entire hospital. Jeong and Shin (2018) suggested healthcare services in which IoT devices were installed in a vehicle to transport patients to the health centers while the ambulances are inaccessible. Hence, the proposed model enabled the hospital to accurately identify the patient's health conditions in real-time caring before the patient arrived. Also, Ghasemi, et al. (Ghasemi et al., 2019) designed an HIoT-based smart home architecture to decrease the cost of elderly care and medicine. According to this design, QoS, availability, performance, security, and interoperability requirements were satisfied.

Ali et al. (Aliet al., 2018) designed an IoT-based healthcare system for long-term care and proposed an efficient fuzzy ontology-based and type-2 fuzzy logic decision-making knowledge-based recommendation system to extract patient risk factors and diabetes prescriptions. Further, this system prevents unauthorized access to patients’ information. The performance, accuracy of prediction, and precision of recommendation were evaluated to validate this system. Subramaniyaswamy et al. (Subramaniyaswamyet al., 2018) introduced a travel recommender system to support travelers following strict diets and have long-term diseases. Moreover, hybrid filtering mechanisms were applied to suggest appropriate recommendations along with intelligent recommendation models with high accuracy and stability.

Lin et al. (Lin et al., 2019) suggested a home healthcare matching service to meet the patients' needs based on their priorities and pre-defined rule-based logic.

(Asghari et al., 2019b) introduced a monitoring system to predict and diagnose some determined diseases; afterward, they recommended an appropriate health/medical service composition to meet the patients’ preferences, such as location, time, and cost limitations. This framework is an accurate, efficient, secure, and privacy preserver based on the experimental results. Moreover, Gope, et al.

5.5. Security-based approaches
Security-based approaches are the last category in the proposed categorization that addresses such aspects of a secure HIoT system as privacy, access control, confidentiality, and trust to provide the QoS in HIoT. Moreover, the security-based articles are reviewed in Section 5.5.1, and applied techniques and tools in the articles and the comparison between them are summarized in Section 5.5.2.

5.5.1. An overview of the selected security-based approaches
This section presents an overview of the selected security-based approaches in four categories as follows.

5.5.1.1. Privacy
The security-based articles focusing on privacy issue are (Boussada et al., 2019), (Elmisery et al., 2016), (Saha et al., 2019), (Tao et al., 2019), (Jiang et al., 2019), (Tang et al., 2019), (Baek et al., 2016), (Elmisery et al., 2017), (Li et al., 2018), (Rani et al., 2019), (Hamza et al., 2020), and (Guo et al., 2020).

Boussada et al. (Boussada et al., 2019) suggested a privacy-preserving HIoT scheme and a lightweight identity-based encryption algorithm to provide privacy, data integrity, and authentication. Experimental results showed the efficiency, privacy-preserving, and low transmission delay of the scheme. Elmisery et al. (Elmisery et al., 2016) presented a privacy-based fog middleware for HIoT that kept the accuracy adopted from cloud-based healthcare recommended service. The authors claimed that this model needed to use game theory to have better groups of HIoT devices. Saha et al. (Saha et al., 2019) proposed an e-healthcare framework that deal with electronic medical records and preserved privacy. The authors proved the high performance and efficiency of the proposed framework in terms of time, memory consumption, latency, and response time; however, the reliability issue was not addressed. Tao et al. (Tao et al., 2019) proposed a secure data collection scheme for HIoT applications that protects users’ privacy. In addition, to validate the scheme, KATAN, and secret cipher share algorithms were simulated to show energy cost, hardware frequency rate, and computation time of the scheme. One of the advantages of this method is its distributed cloud computing architecture that prevents the single point of failure, but this scheme suffers from high complexity and overhead. Jiang et al. (Jiang et al., 2019) implemented a privacy-preserving diabetic retinopathy detection system. The authors illustrated the provision of privacy-preserving homomorphic surf and fast multi-retina-image matching methods. The proposed system has efficient point detection for retinal images of diabetic retinopathy; however, limited homomorphic comparison schemes were applied in experimental results.

Tang et al. (Tang et al., 2019) introduced a multi-source health data aggregation scheme that supports high-level privacy preservation and is resistant to differential attacks. Additionally, the security, fault tolerance, and performance in terms of cost-efficiency, computation time, communication, and storage overhead were evaluated; however, only differential and replay attacks were considered.

Baek et al. (Baek et al., 2016) presented a mobile healthcare system with high privacy and security over the cellular network to help mobile users to communicate anonymously. The system is resistant to some popular attacks such as eavesdropping, matching, replay, collusion, and impersonation attacks. The system also provides unlinkability between the patients’ nicknames and their real identifications in all communications. According to the experimental results, the system is efficient in communication traffic management; however, the constrained battery lifetime of mobile devices has been ignored.

Elmisery et al. (Elmisery et al., 2017) presented a fog middleware for collective privacy in HIoT-based cloud healthcare services that preserves privacy. Experiments showed that the mechanism supported accuracy with high privacy and performance. However, the mechanism is vulnerable to shilling attacks. Li et al. (Li et al., 2018) introduced (a, k)-anonymity model as a privacy-preserving scheme for data collection in healthcare services. Additionally, to the validate proposed scheme, the authors used adult datasets from the UCI machine-learning repository with high privacy, efficiency, and low execution time. Rani et al. (Rani et al., 2019) presented a healthcare data security scheme to provide high security and privacy using the SIMON block cipher algorithm and shared generation model. Experimental results showed the efficiency and performance of the scheme in terms of energy cost, throughput, response time, execution time, and latency; however, the scheme just used specific and limited algorithms. Hamza et al. (Hamza et al., 2020) proposed fast encryption based on probabilistic cryptosystem (chaos-based) to preserve the privacy of patients’ images against different attacks and securely transmit diagnostically images to medical specialists. Finally, Guo, et al. (Guo et al., 2020) presented a data clustering strategy along with hemimorphic encryption to efficiently cluster the data while preserving participants' mutual privacy and keeping secret their private data.

5.5.1.2. Access control
Another category of the selected articles is related to the access control and includes two subcategories namely authorization (Pal et al., 2019), (Yang et al., 2019), (Yang et al., 2018), (Xu et al., 2019) and authentication (Aghili et al., 2019), (Arfaoui et al., 2019), (He and Zeadally, 2015), (Yeh, 2016), (Al-Turjman and Alturjman, 2018), (Deebak et al., 2019), (Huang et al., 2019), (Karimian et al., 2019), (Hou and Yeh, 2015), (Kumar and Gandhi, 2017), (Zhou and Piramuthu, 2018), (Jia et al., 2018), (Karthigaiveni and Indrani, 2019), (Merabet et al., 2019), (Sharma and Kalra, 2019), (Benadda et al., 2018), (Vaishnavi and Sethukarasi, 2020), (Alzahrani, 2020), (Sun et al., 2020), (Gupta et al., 2020), (Xu, 2020), (Alladi and ChamolaNaren, 2020), (Sun et al., 2020), (Sahoo et al., 2020), (Fotouhi et al., 2020), (Islam and Young Shin, 2020).

Pal et al. (Pal et al., 2019) introduced a policy-based access control to protect constrained resources in HIoT from unauthorized access. Moreover, the authors used a decentralized architecture to reduce response time. Yang et al. (Yang et al., 2019) presented a privacy-preserving HIoT-based system along with self-adaptive access control for the authorized users in normal situations and emergencies. Simulation results showed that the system outperformed in terms of performance, efficiency, security, and computational cost. Yang et al. (Yang et al., 2018) introduced a lightweight data sharing system for authorized data users that supported attribute-based and break-glass access to encrypted medical records with low computational and communicational overheads. Xu et al. (Xu et al., 2019) proposed a healthcare IoT system that includes attributed-based encryption for authorized data, cloud and fog computing, and secure fine-grained access control with lightweight decryption. Experiments showed that the performance of the system was better than other schemes.

Aghili et al. (Aghili et al., 2019) introduced an ownership transfer and lightweight, energy-efficient, and secure authentication protocol for HIoT systems. The protocol provided access control and preserved privacy; however, the hardware cost was not optimized.

Arfaoui et al. (Arfaoui et al., 2019) presented a lightweight and context-aware anonymous authentication and key agreement method for WBAN applications in normal and emergency situations. By using the NS2 simulator, the model was validated to show its high efficiency and low overhead. However, there was not a tradeoff between security and energy consumption. He and Zeadally (2015) presented the security requirements of RFID authentication methods and a review of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-based RFID authentication methods in terms of security and performance in the healthcare environment. Eventually, the proposed ECC-based RFID authentication method had acceptable computation and communication costs, and all the security requirements were satisfied.

Yeh (2016) presented two secure authentication schemes for IoT-based healthcare, relying on body sensor networks (BSNs). The feasibility and practicability of the presented schemes were proved by using Raspberry PI platform. Furthermore, the proposed schemes are suitable to implement common intelligent mobile objects with robust security density and confidentiality. However, the suggested schemes are vulnerable to SHA-2 attack. Al-Turjman and Alturjman (2018) proposed a context-sensitive identity-provisioning framework for the industrial HIoT using wireless sensor networks along with a secure mutual authentication approach. The framework was resilient to some known attacks and was suitable for real-time applications. Simulation results showed its high-performance efficiency with low overhead and bandwidth usage. Despite all advantages of the framework, its major weak point was low reliability.

Deebak et al. (Deebak et al., 2019) proposed a secure biometric-based user authentication scheme to reduce computation and communication cost and storage to improve the performance of any real-time-based healthcare application systems. Huang et al. (Huang et al., 2019) introduced a lightweight authentication scheme for noisy ECG signals to provide more efficient privacy protection. The scheme was compared with other schemes to prove its high accuracy and reliability. However, only two data sets were used to analyze the proposed scheme. Karimian et al. (Karimian et al., 2019) proposed a noise-aware biometric key generation/authentication framework that outperformed other deep-learning-based access control and data protection schemes in terms of reliability, cost, energy, accuracy, and performance. Although the security and privacy aspects were considered, the framework was vulnerable to some attacks.

Hou and Yeh (2015) designed a secure authentication model for IoT-based healthcare. Indeed, the model included an authentication-based sign-on technique and a one-way hash function with a random nonce to ensure system security robustness and efficiency. Further, the model was resistant to replay and forgery attacks. Kumar and Gandhi (2017) introduced smart gateway-based authorization and authentication scheme to protect sensitive physiological data against malicious users and attackers. Zhou and Piramuthu (2018) presented a flexible technology in a supply chain with a sample of RFID implementation in a health care service. This adaptive knowledge-based system could switch between authentication protocols based on environmental characteristics, and it had the capability to learn from its mistakes. Jia et al. (Jia et al., 2018) proposed an authenticated key agreement scheme for fog-driven applications based on bilinear pairings and elliptic curve groups. The scheme was robust against some popular attacks such as stolen smart card attacks, replay attacks, and its security was proved in the random oracle model. In addition, the performance of the scheme was validated in terms of computation and communication costs. However, the use of mathematical algorithms, including the elliptic curve cryptography, caused overhead, complexity, and low efficiency. Karthigaiveni and Indrani (2019), using elliptic curve cryptography and smart card, proposed an efficient password along with two-factor authentication scheme for HIoT. Based on the analysis of the scheme in random oracle model, the scheme was secure with low computational and communication costs; however, the privacy issue was ignored.

Merabet et al. (Merabet et al., 2019) presented three efficient and lightweight authentication protocols for IoT-based healthcare applications. Two of them were suitable for the machine-to-cloud communication mode, and the last one was for the machine-to-machine mode. According to the experimental results, these authentication protocols outperformed in terms of performance. Sharma and Kalra (Zhou and Piramuthu, 2018) presented a secure authentication scheme for real-time remote patient monitoring, which was lightweight, robust, and reliable against multiple security attacks. AVISPA simulation tool was applied to validate the security and efficiency of the scheme. Benadda et al. (Benadda et al., 2018) implemented a secure HIoT-based wearable framework to monitor elderlies’ motions. The authors considered hardware implementation before software running. In this regard, the authentication chip ATSHA204A was used to generate a unique identification code, and then it was combined with cryptographic protocols to satisfy the security requirements.

Vaishnavi and Sethukarasi (2020) proposed an authentication scheme including a lightweight encryption algorithm to transmit health records securely and a novel detection algorithm to detect suspicious users as Sybil nodes and broadcast the list of them. Alzahrani (2020), using symmetric key encryption, the proposed authentication and key agreement scheme for medical information systems improved authenticity. Sun et al. (Sun et al., 2020) proposed an optimized vector transformation method to design a privacy-preserving lightweight access control policy for smart HIoT that eliminates the burden of encryption, decryption, and key generation. Gupta et al. (Gupta et al., 2020) presented an access control and authentication scheme based on lattice for HIoT systems that mitigate several attacks. Xu (2020) presented an IoT-assisted framework to securely transmit data, enforcing access control, analyze ECG signal strength, and monitor cardiovascular health continuously.

Furthermore, Alladi, et al. (Alladi and ChamolaNaren, 2020) leveraged hardware security functionalities and proposed a lightweight two-way authentication protocol, which takes into account the IoT devices energy and memory constraints. Sun et al. (Sun et al., 2020) integrated SDN and edge computing to propose a secure framework that edge servers authenticate IoT devices, and then these devices could collect and send the patients’ data to edge servers. Sahoo et al. (Sahoo et al., 2020) used ECC and presented a key agreement and three-factor authentication scheme. It provides security, mutual authentication, and user anonymity along with low computational and communication cost. Fotouhi et al. (Fotouhi et al., 2020) proposed an authentication scheme based on the hash chain for WBANs in HIoT that provides security and authenticity with low computational and storage cost. Finally, Islam and Young Shin (Islam and Young Shin, 2020) proposed a secure healthcare design based on blockchain that provides some security features.

This study improved computational cost and security issues. EL-Latif et al. (EL-Latif et al., 2020) proposed an image-encryption-based method for controlled alternate quantum walks (CAQWs) to preserve the privacy of healthcare images in IoT; efficiency and security of the method were proved by simulation and numerical analysis. Li and Jing (2019) designed a hybrid IoT-fog-cloud framework in which fog was distributed between the IoT devices and cloud to overcome resource limitations and meet storage, security, and privacy requirements. Furthermore, the framework used keyword-searchable encryption with fine-grained access control. Elhoseny et al.

Manogaran et al. (Manogaran et al., 2018) presented the architecture of HIoT systems to store, process, and analyze big data in BSN with concentrating on security aspects. Additionally, this architecture used a MapReduce-based prediction model to predict heart diseases. Gope and Hwang (2016) described security and privacy scheme in BSN healthcare applications, called BSN-Care, to accomplish efficiently various security requirements of BSN-based healthcare systems. Ullah et al. (Ullah et al., 2020b) proposed a fog-assisted HIoT scheme to aggregate and transmit data and provide security against several attacks and illegal data access with low communication cost and energy consumption. Rathee et al. (Rathee et al., 2019) introduced a secure framework about health multimedia data by using blockchain to generate a hash of each data, provide security chains of records, and store them in the network. Therefore, any change in data was reflected in the entire blockchain network, and nobody could perform any illegal activities. Abou-Nassar et al.

To answer this question, the authors evaluate HIoT systems in three dimensions, including evaluation factors, evaluation techniques, and evaluation tools as follows.

•
Evaluation factors

According to Table 5, Table 7, Table 9, Table 11, Table 13, performance (22 %), security (21 %), and time (18 %), respectively, are the essential metrics among all applied factors, as shown in Fig. 10. In the sensor-based approaches, as illustrated in Fig. 11, performance (27 %), energy (24 %), and reliability (13 %) are the most applied metrics. In the resource-based group, such parameters as time (41 %), energy (17 %), and reliability (10 %) have attracted researchers’ attention more than other parameters. Authors have attempted to improve time by 27 % and performance and energy with 21 % in the communication-based category. The performance and accuracy with 22 % and time with 19 % are other important parameters in the application-based approaches. In security-based approaches, such parameters as privacy, access control, confidentiality, and trust with 40 %, performance with 21 %, and time with 14 % are important parameters. It should be noted that the mentioned percentages have obtained from (1) (Hamzei and Navimipour, 2018):(1)

7. Open issues, future trends, and challenges
Now, there exist significant problems to improve IoT-based healthcare systems that have not been studied much in the current research trends. In this section, to answer RQ4, open issues, future trends, and challenges in HIoT systems have been debated.

➢
RQ4: What are the key open issues, future trends, and challenges in IoT-based healthcare systems?

After analyzing the collected data through this review on the HIoT field and also regarding the increasing requirements for applying effective HIoT systems in the real physical world, we observed that open issues, challenges, and future directions can be categorized into three separate groups as shown in Fig. 14.

Fig. 14. An overview of open issues, future trends, and challenges in HIoT.

The main challenges that HIoT systems involve are scalability, interoperability, and mobility. Furthermore, the lack of a real testbed environment for evaluating the efficiency of HIoT systems in the real world can be considered as another important challenge in developing HIoT systems. On the other hand, regarding the mentioned challenges, several issues have remained as open issues to be addressed: the relevant problems of computing environments like fog computing in which the HIoT system is developed and deployed, and some operational and technical problems like power and resource management issues regarding the limitation of storage and computing capacity of fog nodes. According to different expected objectives in HIoT systems, other open issues comprise multi-objective optimization and providing privacy and trust. With respect to the increasing need to apply computer-aided technologies in developing healthcare systems, some directions in the HIoT field, including IoNT, Blockchain, Tactile Internet, SDN/NFV, online social networks, big data analysis, and QoS, can be considered as future trends. Details of the mentioned challenges, open issues, and future trends are explained in the following section.

7.1. Open issues
•
Trust and privacy: In the reviewed literature, trust, and privacy management (Boussada et al., 2019), (Elmisery et al., 2016), (Saha et al., 2019), (Tao et al., 2019), (Jiang et al., 2019), (Tang et al., 2019), (Baek et al., 2016), (Elmisery et al., 2017), (Li et al., 2018), (Rani et al., 2019), (Hamza et al., 2020), (Guo et al., 2020), (Manogaran et al., 2018), (Gope and Hwang, 2016), (Ullah et al., 2020b), (Rathee et al., 2019), (Abou-Nassar et al., 2020), (Amin et al., 2020) are significant open issues for data access and data storage in IoT-based healthcare platforms. Trust can be defined as managing credentials and controlling access to service providers' and patients' confidential information and privacy as preventing unauthorized access to both of them. Healthcare IoT-based systems are designed and expanded based on the obtained data from IoT devices. Furthermore, with the increase in the number of IoT devices connected to the network, the vulnerability of the immense data being transferred and stored is also increased (Boussada et al., 2019), (Manogaran et al., 2018). Nonetheless, according to the reviewed studies, a few papers have adequately evaluated this critical metric. Therefore, to reduce the risk of hacking essential data and to increase data protection such as a person's behavior pattern, habits, sleeping order, locations, and physical conditions over time-trust and privacy are very challenging as open issues.

•
Power management: Based on the studied literature, energy consumption (Wu et al., 2017), (Wu et al., 2018), (Niitsuet al., 2018), (Tekeste et al., 2019), (Hallforset al., 2018), (Ray et al., 2019d), (Elstset al., 2018), (Chen et al., 2018), (Abdelmoneem et al., 2020), (Awanet al., 2019), (Sengupta and Bhunia, 2020), (Minet al., 2019), (Bharathiet al., 2020), (Catarinucciet al., 2015), (Abdellatif et al., 2018), (Aktas et al., 2018), (Chehri and Mouftah, 2020), (Qiu et al., 2017), (Chanak and Banerjee, 2020), (Sharavana Kumar and Sarma Dhulipala, 2020), (Tuliet al., 2020), (Rahmaniet al., 2018), (Ramírez López et al., 2019), (Onasanya et al., 2019), (Vedaeiet al., 2020), (Boussada et al., 2019), (Tao et al., 2019), (Rani et al., 2019), (Hamza et al., 2020), (Yang et al., 2019), (Aghili et al., 2019), (Karimian et al., 2019), (Benadda et al., 2018), (Gupta et al., 2020), (Xu, 2020), (Islam and Young Shin, 2020), (Li and Jing, 2019), (Gope and Hwang, 2016), (Ullah et al., 2020b) is the main open issue to decrease high operational costs and massive carbon production in HIoT systems. In addition, a typical HIoT network includes small devices with limited battery power. Therefore, some factors, such as systematic standby control and data migration, have important roles in achieving inferior energy consumption without decreasing the quality of smart healthcare services (Chen et al., 2018). Hence, low power devices have to be designed to increase HIoT systems' lifetime and decrease the possibility of patients being offline. Therefore, another challenge of HIoT is power management.

•
Fog computing: Fog computing (Abdelmoneem et al., 2020), (Asif-Ur-Rahmanet al., 2019), (Awaisi et al., 2020), (Wang and Li, 2020), (He et al., 2017), (Ray et al., 2019e), (Sood and Mahajan, 2019), (Azimiet al., 2017), (Tuliet al., 2020), (Rajan et al., 2020), (Kesavan and Arumugam, 2020), (Rahmaniet al., 2018), (Elmisery et al., 2016), (Saha et al., 2019), (Jia et al., 2018), (Sun et al., 2020), (Li and Jing, 2019), (Ullah et al., 2020a) is crucial in healthcare IoT environments as the location of computing is dynamic and depends on requirements of the environment, contexts, and applications. Additionally, it needs low and predictable latency to provide service delivery to end-users in emergencies, to minimize the volume of transferred data to the cloud while vital data are being transferred to the fog for processing and storage, and to reduce bandwidth and battery resources. Despite many advances in this area, more activities are needed to satisfy the mentioned requirements in HIoT systems (Rajan et al., 2020), (Rahmaniet al., 2018). Therefore, fog computing is very challenging for researchers.

•
Resource management: HIoT nodes have limited computational power and storage; their assignments are tremendous. Therefore, managing and efficiently using smart healthcare devices is critical in the HIoT environment. Generally, the resource management (Ray et al., 2019a), (Abdelmoneem et al., 2020), (Yi and Cai, 2019), (Awanet al., 2019), (Manikandan et al., 2020), (Asif-Ur-Rahmanet al., 2019), (Kavitha and Sharma, 2019), (Sengupta and Bhunia, 2020), (Awaisi et al., 2020), (Minet al., 2019), (Wang and Cai, 2020), (He et al., 2017), (Bharathiet al., 2020), (Kumar and Silambarasan, 2019) can lead to more studies and investigations. Additionally, with the mobility and relocation properties of smart devices, resource management should efficiently apply various services to create an optimal application of the accessible resources and provide appropriate services in HIoT (Asif-Ur-Rahmanet al., 2019). Therefore, another important open issue of this study is resource management.

•
Multi-objective optimization: In the reviewed literature, it is clear that some QoS factors of HIoT systems were considered, and the others were ignored. For example, in some algorithms, cost and delay are considered, and other factors like reliability and power, are ignored. Therefore, an optimal mechanism that considers different objectives to create a tradeoff among different QoS factors in HIoT systems (Niitsuet al., 2018), (Esmaeili et al., 2020), (Ray et al., 2019d), (Elstset al., 2018), (Chen et al., 2018), (Sengupta and Bhunia, 2020), (Minet al., 2019), (Catherwood et al., 2018), (Aktas et al., 2018), (Qiu et al., 2017), (Ray et al., 2019e), (Sharavana Kumar and Sarma Dhulipala, 2020), (Patan et al., 2020), (Vedaraj and Ezhumalai, 2020), (Azimiet al., 2017), (Khowaja et al., 2018), (Tuliet al., 2020), (Alhussein et al., 2018), (Rajan et al., 2020), (Ray et al., 2018), (Rahmani et al., 2020), (Kesavan and Arumugam, 2020), (Ramírez López et al., 2019), (Ghasemi et al., 2019), (Vedaeiet al., 2020), (Lin et al., 2019), (Asghari et al., 2019b), (Boussada et al., 2019), (Tao et al., 2019), (Rani et al., 2019), (Hamza et al., 2020), (Karimian et al., 2019), (Vaishnavi and Sethukarasi, 2020), (Sun et al., 2020), (Gupta et al., 2020), (Sun et al., 2020), (Li and Jing, 2019), (Ming et al., 2020), (Ullah et al., 2020a), (Gope and Hwang, 2016) may be an open issue.

7.2. Future trends
•
Blockchain: Another option that could be associated with the future of the edge/IoT environment is blockchain. The incapability to change information or delete from blocks makes the blockchain the best appropriate technology for the healthcare system by providing secure management and analysis of big health data. Moreover, it is an immutable, clear consensus and permanent protocol to leverage peer-to-peer and distributed communication without the need for centralized authority; the “Internet of edge-block” may be supposed to help the existing edge-IoT environment to act transparently and autonomously while processing the decentralized end-users’ requests (Qadri et al., 2020), (Rathee et al., 2019), (Ali et al., 2019). Indeed, this problem has not received much attention from the researchers, so, to this end, blockchain in HIoT can be an interesting direction for the future.

•
Tactile Internet: The idea of Internet sensorial connectivity is called tactile Internet (TI). It is based on IEEE's definition of communication standardization among devices to reproduce the stimuli and senses and create perception capability in the digital world. The emergence of 5G communication technology led to probing TI-based applications in healthcare and robotics fields specifically. The role of TI in healthcare can be applied at tremor suppression in Parkinson's disease, remote surgeries, interactive medical training, trauma rehabilitation, virtual and augmented reality-based training and rehabilitation, and so on (Ruan et al., 2017). Therefore, TI applications have some potentials in HIoT that can be good opportunities for future research.

•
SDN/NFV: Regarding the limitation of HIoT resources, software-defined network (SDN) support in HIoT systems can make the management of HIoT more proper. The mixture of HIoT and network function virtualization (NFV) provide speed and flexibility in the construction, management, and deployment of novel applicant-based services (Sun et al., 2020), (Hu et al., 2015). Using SDN and NFV technologies to support QoS needs in HIoT is an engrossing area for future research.

•
Online social networks: Online social networks might act as a trustworthy online platform to found interfaces of service application among healthcare providers (HP) and healthcare users (HU) anytime and anywhere. This paradigm enables the IoT medical devices to HU's bio-data with remote HP through both computational resource-rich and storage-rich social networks. The nodes of social networks are friendship, work, common interests, knowledge, prestige, etc., that can be organized to exchange information, knowledge, or financial assistance (Hao and Wang, 2017), (Bazzaz Abkenar et al., 2021). This paradigm in HIoT is a new area to predict the patient's health status, and it has excellent potentials for future studies.

•
Big data analytics: IoT big data analytics have been the base of recent smart healthcare systems. In other words, the convergence of big data analytics and IoT has ended in the development of modern medical telematics and informatics such as diagnosis of diseases, remote and real-time health monitoring systems, prevention systems, and medical emergency and alerting systems (Saheb and Izadi, 2019). The data obtained from heterogeneous devices in IoT environments have an extended volume of information related to users' personal lifestyles in the long run and have the various, complicated, and complete context of other information related to health. It is significant to study the manner of exploring all these big data under IoT systems to bring intelligence for policy formulation and more decisive clinical decision-making, but this issue has not received much attention in all investigations (Qi et al., 2017), (Yang et al., 2019), (Manogaran et al., 2018), (Fathi et al., 2021). Hence, big data analytics in IoT-based healthcare systems is another interesting line for future studies.

•
Service quality: Recently, HIoT has been applied for real-time applications. QoS mostly deals with the quality and timeliness of the HIoT data used to support the decision. It is required that the data produced from sensors of healthcare be collected, analyzed, transferred, and applied on time; however, sometimes, the necessary data are not provided immediately, which seems to be a challenge for HIoT systems. IoT devices produce wide-scale real-time data in terms of variety, volume, and velocity, leading to a considerable challenge in analyzing such data. As medical wearable systems deal with real-time and life-critical applications, they need a strong guarantee of QoS. There is a wide gap in different areas like real-time tracking of patients, data collection, and automated decision-making support based on QoS (Dhanvijay and Patil, 2019), (Patan et al., 2020), (Ray et al., 2018). No need to say that these challenges have to be overcome on the basis of QoS.

•
Internet of nano things: With the emergence of the Internet of nano things (IoNT), numerous applications can be recognized by IoNT for healthcare, including nanorobots for delivering drugs to special organs with great accuracy, nanosensors, precision medicine, minimally invasive surgical procedures, and a swarm of nanorobots for human body parts that are not accessible (Pramanik et al., 2020). Finally, the IoNT is leading the network revolution at the nanoscale with applications in sensing and precision medicine as a future direction.

7.3. Challenges
•
Scalability: Another significant criterion in the healthcare system is scalability. In other words, it is the ability of a system to satisfy the changing needs and adapt to the changes on a bigger scale in the future. In the literature studied, some of the proposed approaches in HIoT systems can operate on a small scale, and the validity of these approaches is just guaranteed by some nodes or devices. Scalability is an important factor. However, the suggested approaches were mostly used in limited scenarios, which seems to be a challenge.

•
Interoperability and standardization: Interoperability is a major factor in exchanging resources and data between patients and smart objects in HIoT. Interoperability's main challenge is developing open-source frameworks with a steady connection; a collection of standards has to be set to make horizontal platforms capable of operability, programmability, and communicability among devices, operating systems, and applications, not having any concerns about the manufacturer or the model. Having some architectures that are scalable to interact with non-homogeneous data centers and smart objects and procuring dynamic and adaptive architectures that are interoperable for large-scale IoT applications are other challenges (Jabbar et al., 2017). Totally, the open challenge in HIoT systems is interoperability and standardization.

•
Mobility: Mobility is one of the major challenges in HIoT, which has been less discussed in the literature. Mobility in IoT healthcare systems is the ability to use network support for the patients that can connect to the gateway anytime and anywhere. Further, mobility is necessary to make the network fault-tolerant, provides complete access to information disregarding their locations, and enhance service quality. Due to the importance of provisioning in healthcare, a mobility protocol must be reliable to decrease packet losses, network failures under any circumstances, and end-to-end delays because (Rahmaniet al., 2018). Therefore, mobility is an interesting challenge for research.

•
Real testbed environment: The HIoT approaches proposed in the studies should be implemented in real environments, while only 24 % of the reviewed studies have been conducted in real testbeds (as shown in Fig. 12), and the others have been tested with simulation tools. Frankly speaking, all the proposed approaches must be implemented in real testbeds to conclude whether they can provide a suitable healthcare system or not. Therefore, real testbed implementation is a challenge.

8. Threats to validity and limitations
Threats to the validity of this research study are considered in several steps as follows:

Step 1. Threats to the identification of complete primary articles: In the research strategy, the most crucial factor is to collect comprehensive available literature without any bias. To this end, the common strings were searched and combined in the search term. Besides, a review protocol was designed to identify relevant and unbiased studies.

Step 2. Threats to selection and data extraction: In systematic reviews, each study deals with a quality assessment (Brereton et al., 2007):

•
The bias in the result: The aim is to have the correct results.

•
Internal validity: The goal is to conduct the study without systematic error.

•
External validity: The aim is to see the applicable effects outside the context of the study.

Two types of quality assessments are used in this investigation. The first type was to assess the articles' quality with their ability to answer the research questions, and the second kind was applied to respond to one of our primary RQs.

Step 3. Threats to data synthesizes and results: The reliability threat is another challenge of reviews (Jamshidi et al., 2013). This issue was obtained from a unified characterization model, multiple researchers, and several other steps in which method and process were piloted and externally evaluated. Although we used the guidelines in (Brereton et al., 2007), (KitchenhamKeele, 2004) to provide an SLR, we had deviations from their methods described in Section 4.

With the use of a systematic review, external evaluations, and different researchers, we can claim that the validity of the review is high.

This review aimed at providing a comprehensive and systematic review; however, some limitations of this study should be considered in the future as follows:

•
In this research, only reputed journal articles are regarded for their best qualifications. Therefore, books, book chapters, conference papers, symposiums, non-English scripts, non-JCR papers, commentaries and review articles, and short articles have been excluded.

•
Due to the wide range of literature on the topic of HIoT systems, only JCR-indexed journal articles were considered despite other reputed conference articles.

•
In this manuscript, we applied ten-known online databases that suggested relevant reputed papers. However, the authors cannot claim to have selected all articles on the HIoT subject.

•
In Section 4.1, four questions were asked to expand this topic; however, other problems can be proposed.

•
The reviewed articles in this research were categorized into five classes, including sensor-based, resource-based, communication-based, application-based, and security-based approaches. However, other classes might be possible.

9. Conclusion
This paper presented an SLR on the Internet of things in healthcare systems. First, 1343 articles between 2015 and 2020 were selected; then, based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 146 articles out of 1343 articles were selected to analyze and exploit appropriate data. With respect to RQ2, the selected articles were classified into five classifications, including sensor-based, resource-based, communication-based, application-based, and security-based approaches. According to our classifications, the security-based category was on the top of others with 37 ​% frequency, while the application-based by 32 ​%, the sensor-based by 12 ​%, the resource-based by 10 ​%, and the communication-based by 9 ​% came next respectively. Further, the main idea of each paper, along with its benefits and limitations, were explored. In addition, based on RQ3, the evaluation factors, types, and used tools in the studied articles were discussed. According to the statistics, most articles attempted to improve the performance by 22 ​%, security by 21 ​%, and time by 18 ​%. Moreover, the comparison of evaluation techniques indicated that 57 ​% of the studied articles employed simulation environments, and 24 ​% employed real testbeds to evaluate HIoT systems. Besides, MATLAB and C/C++/C# are the applied evaluation tools and environments. Eventually, according to RQ4, to develop more efficient HIoT systems, some open issues and future trends such as power management, trust and privacy, fog computing, multi-objective optimization, resource management, QoS, blockchain, tactile Internet, SDN/NFV, online social networks, big data analytics, and IoNT should be considered. Lucidly, the most important challenges are interoperability, scalability, mobility, and real-testbed implementation. We assuredly hope that these results will help other researchers to develop HIoT systems efficiently as their future works.
