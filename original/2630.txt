This article proposes an approach to select EEG channels based on EEG shapelet transformation, aiming
to reduce the setup time and inconvenience for subjects and to improve the applicable performance of
Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). In detail, the method selects top-k EEG channels by solving a logistic
loss-embedded minimization problem with respect to EEG shapelet learning, hyperplane learning, and EEG
channel weight learning simultaneously. Especially, to learn distinguished EEG shapelets for weighting contributions of each EEG channel to the logistic loss, EEG shapelet similarity is also minimized during the
procedure. Furthermore, the gradient descent strategy is adopted in the article to solve the non-convex optimization problem, which finally leads to the algorithm termed StEEGCS. In a result, classification accuracy,
with those EEG channels selected by StEEGCS, is improved compared to that with all EEG channels, and
classification time consumption is reduced as well. Additionally, the comparisons with several state-of-theart EEG channel selection methods on several real-world EEG datasets also demonstrate the efficacy and
superiority of StEEGCS.

1 INTRODUCTION
Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is widely used to diagnose neuropsychiatric disorders such
as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) [6, 24], epileptic seizure [49, 50], stroke [45], and so on [52], and it is
also practically applied in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs or Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs))
Fig. 1. The aim of the proposed method. Problem statement presents that most researches used too many
EEG channels/electrodes to record and analyze EEG signals for BCI-based applications (i.e., wheelchair navigation, robotic arm control, and EEG-based spelling, and so on), which involves some shortcomings; Methodology briefly explains the EEG shapelet-transformed channel selection proposed in the article, which mainly
aims to solve a logistic loss-embedded minimization function to learn distinct EEG shapelets, hyperplane,
and channel weights/contributions simultaneously. In the end, EEG channels are selected based on the channel weights; Result indicates the selected EEG channels based on their channel contributions to classification
performance, with which the efficacy of BCI-based applications can be significantly enhanced or improved.
The advantages of EEG channel selection are also summarized in the figure.
[3, 14, 48], since it can reflect the states and functions of human brain and even the whole body [16].
For specific functions, they are activated in accordingly specific positions of brain. For instance,
the motor tasks, including motor imagery, are related to the motor cortex; the visual-based tasks
are located in the primary visual cortex area, and the frontoparietal regions correspond to decision
making [19, 47]. As one type of biological potentials that can be recorded in a non-invasive way,
many channels or electrodes of EEG acquisition equipment are commonly used in wide applications. Although more channels theoretically provide more information of brain functions, it
correspondingly causes high dimensional and redundant EEG data, since (1) as introduced above,
specific functions are activated in specific cortex of brain, channels attached on non-specific
areas are useless or redundant for analysis; (2) channels that have small contributions for EEG
analysis result in extra time or space to process and analyze, without significantly improving the
performance of analytical methods such as classification; (3) it increases the inconvenience for
subjects in BCI-based applications when using more EEG channels. Consequently, EEG channel
selection is a necessary process for its follow-up analysis, especially for BCI-based applications
in our daily life, because it can significantly reduce the impact of noisy/redundant channels
and promote the contributions of informative channels for EEG analysis. Particularly, less but
more informative EEG channels are also beneficial to BCI applications. Besides, channel selection
methods can identify informative and suitable recording sites from a large amount of sites without
any prior knowledge of specific cerebral tasks, and reduce the redundancy of EEG electrodes
for EEG signal classification without losing its performance [30]. Figure 1 briefly presents the
disadvantages (or problems) of existing researches and applications using a large number of EEG
channels. Besides, it also shows the reasons why we are going to solve the problem by listing the
advantages of EEG channel reduction for its applications. However, how to perform optimal EEG
channel selection is not a trivial task, since manually selecting EEG channels based on experts’
knowledge does not guarantee to achieve better results compared to that with all channels [7].

Shapelet-transformed Multi-channel EEG Channel Selection 58:3
In this article, we handled the challenging task of EEG channel selection for its classification. In
detail, it utilizes EEG shapelets to represent original multi-channel EEG signals and then weights
EEG channel contributions according to their logistic loss in shapelet-transformed space. Finally,
the top-k EEG channels that contribute more to the logistic loss are selected out. The procedure
of the proposed method is also roughly introduced in Figure 1. Further, the contributions of this
article are highlighted below.
• Shapelet-transformed EEG channel selection is mapped to a minimization objective function of logistic loss that simultaneously considers distinct EEG shapelets, optimal EEG channel contributions to classification performance, and good hyperplane for classifier.
• EEG shapelet similarity minimization is also considered to learn distinct EEG shapelets that
highly represent original multi-channel EEG signals.
• A novel approach of EEG channel selection is proposed that we call StEEGCS by using
gradient descent to learn EEG shapelets, channel weights, and hyperplane of classifier.
• Experimental results compared to five classic and state-of-the-art methods on 10 real-world
EEG datasets demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of StEEGCS for multi-channel EEG
channel selection.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows: The related work on EEG channel selection
is reviewed in Section 2. The proposed method is introduced in Section 3, followed by the selection algorithm StEEGCS in Section 4. Then a detailed experimentation is carried out in Section 5.
Finally, a summary of the article is presented in Section 6.
2 RELATED WORK
Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) provides a good way for rehabilitation or a tool to improve living
quality of the disabled by using the brain to control wheelchairs or robotic arms. In BCI-based
applications, EEG classification plays an important role. Netzer et al. [38] proposed an approach
for EEG classification in BCI applications by using core sets that link to BCI with data summarization. Jafarifarmand [23] proposed a new framework that first applied an artifact rejected common
spatial pattern to reduce artifacts, and then utilized a strategy named self-regulated supervised
Gaussian fuzzy adaptive system Art to classify motor imagery EEG signals. He et al. [20] classified
motor imagery EEG signals by using a common Bayesian network constructed by related EEG
channels connected by common and varying edges. Additionally, many state-of-the-art methods
for EEG classification have emerged recently, such as References [1, 17, 27]. But the classification
accuracy and efficiency influence the performance of BCI applications in daily life. To improve the
efficiency and accuracy of EEG classification, EEG channel selection is subsequently adopted. In recent decades, many studies on EEG channel selection or reduction for BCI have emerged and have
achieved a lot in this field [2]. In this article, we generally categorized these methods into three
classes: common spatial pattern-based methods, entropy/mutual information-based methods, and
classifier-embedded methods.
Common spatial pattern (CSP)-based methods [36, 51] select EEG channels based on their CSP
coefficients without deriving the features corresponding to each EEG channel. CSP-based channel
selection methods consider all the EEG channels and they are highly sensitive to EEG artifacts,
such as electrooculography and electromyography. Furthermore, as is known to all, CSP-based
methods are also suffering from over-fitting. To deal with this problem, a regularized CSP and
a sparse CSP are proposed in References [12, 28, 35] and [4], respectively, both of which aim to
remove irrelevant EEG channels and obtain sparse spatial filters for EEG classification. They all
achieved better performance than the classic CSP, but they still more or less suffer from overfitting
and artifact sensitivity inherited from CSP.

58:4 C. Dai et al.
Entropy [40, 41, 48, 53] or mutual-information-based [29, 31] methods select EEG channels by
ranking them with entropy or mutual information between EEG channels and EEG classes. In
detail, the most relevant channels according to their entropies or mutual information to corresponding classes are selected out. These methods are independent from specific classifiers, but
they suffer from low accuracy due to their ignorance of correlations among different EEG channels [2].
Classifier-embedded EEG channel selection methods such as introduced in References [15, 30],
which are mainly based on the classification performance of a classifier to select EEG channels in
a way that the channels with lower contribution to classification are eliminated. Actually, these
classifier-embedded methods probably achieve higher classification accuracy than CSP or mutualinformation-based methods, since classifier-embedded channel selection methods directly consider the classification accuracy into the objective function that reflects the goal of channel selection for EEG classification. However, they rely on a specific classifier such as support vector
machine (SVM) [4].
Despite those various methods, selecting optimal EEG channels for BCI-based applications remains a challenging task. Therefore, this article proposes an EEG shapelet-transformed approach
to select EEG channels. In detail, the original EEG data are first mapped into EEG shapelet representation space, and then based on EEG shapelets, those EEG channels contribute more to the
logistic loss are selected. Namely, EEG channels with higher weights or contributions to the classification are probably selected. Particularly, EEG shapelets significantly influence the procedure.
To improve the efficiency and accuracy for EEG time-series classification, many approaches for
shapelet transform, learning, and selection, especially for time series [11, 21, 22] are proposed in
existing studies. Ji et al. [26] proposed an efficient shapelet discovery approach for time-series
classification based on important data points. Then, in their work [25], they proposed another
algorithm for time-series shapelet selection, which first sampled time series and then selected
shapelets efficiently based on the local farthest deviation points (LFDPs) from sampled time series,
which reduced time consumption a lot. Li et al. [32] also proposed a shapelet discovery approach
for time-series classification that was named Pruning Shapelets with Key Points (PSKP) in a way
that they applied standard deviation to search the key points of a time series and then extracted
time-series shapelets based on such key points. In their work [42], Rakthanmannon et al. presented
an efficient scalable algorithm of shapelets discovery for time-series classification, which used SAX
[39] strategy to extract shapelets of time series. Grabocka et al. [18] exploited an objective function embedded classification to learn top-k shapelets for time series. Similar to Reference [18], our
method also utilized the classification-embedded strategy to select EEG channels. It exploited a
logistic loss minimization function to simultaneously learn EEG shapelets, hyperplane, and EEG
channel weights, which built a direct correlation between relevant EEG channels and classification performance. In other words, the proposed method can help classifier (e.g., SVM) achieve the
highest classification accuracy with selected EEG channels.
3 THE METHOD
In this section, we introduce the proposed method that is transformed to a minimization objective
function with respect to EEG shapelets, channel contributions, and hyperplane weights. Additionally, the brief procedure of the method is also illustrated in Figure 1. In detail, the proposed
method selects EEG channels based on EEG channel weights/contributions to its classification performance. That is to say, to get EEG channel weights is the essential goal of the method. To the
end, the solution to achieve EEG channel weights is mainly transformed to EEG shapelet learning
in a shapelet representation space. First, a similarity minimization evaluation is brought in, which
aims to learn the most informative and distinct EEG shapelets to represent original EEG. Then, a

Shapelet-transformed Multi-channel EEG Channel Selection 58:5
hyperplane is required to learn as well, which aims to achieve a better classifier for EEG classification along with selected EEG channels. In the method, a logistic loss function simultaneously
integrated with distinct EEG shapelet learning, hyperplane learning, and EEG channel contribution learning is eventually proposed, and its aim is to minimize the logistic loss (namely, higher
classification accuracy). As the objective function is non-convex and not differentiable, the gradient descent strategy is adopted to solve it. During the procedure, EEG shapelets, hyperplane, and
EEG channel weights are learnt iteratively with gradient descent strategy until their integrated logistic loss is locally minimized. Besides, the detailed descriptions for gradient descent-based EEG
shapelet learning, hyperplane learning, and EEG channel weight learning are, respectively, presented in detail as follows. Finally, the methodology leads to the algorithm of StEEGCS for EEG
channel selection.
3.1 EEG Shapelet
Shapelet, widely applied in time-series data mining [33, 54, 55], is a subsequence from original time
series [37]. Similarly, EEG shapelet is a continuous EEG subsequence that inherits structures from
the original EEG, and it is usually much shorter than the original EEG. Particularly, EEG shapelet
is a small subsequence, as a pattern of original EEG, that can represent the original EEG data and
separate EEG into different groups based on their distance to EEG shapelets.
Definition 3.1. Given an EEG e of length m, a shapelet si,l of e is a continuous subsequence with
length l ≤ m, that starts at position i. That is, si,l = ti,...,ti+l−1, where 1 ≤ i ≤ m − l + 1.
3.2 Shapelet-transformed Representation
Given an EEG dataset E = {ei, e2,..., en }N ×C×M , where ei denotes an EEG signal of C channels
(i.e., ei = [ei,1, ei,2,..., ei,c ]C×M ) with M samples for each channel, and a set of channel shapelets
S = {s1, s2,..., sk }K×L, where sk denotes the kth shapelet with length of L, the distance of an
EEG ei to shapelet sk is represented as Di,k ∈ D ∈ RL×K and D denotes their distance matrix or
representation. Formally, we define ei,c,j as the EEG segment of channel c and j is the starting
point of segment. Obviously, there are J = M − L + 1 EEG segments for each EEG channel. The
distance Di,k between channel shapelet sk and EEG ei can be calculated with Equation (1):
Di,k = min

where πk,c ∈ [0, 1) is the weight of each shapelet for a particular EEG channel, i.e., the channel
contribution with respect to a particular shapelet.
The shapelets learned from original EEG data can be transformed into a new representation
D ∈ RN ×C∗×K of E ∈ RN ×C×M , whereC∗ denotes the number of selected EEG channels. Obviously,
this transformation reduces the dimension of original EEG, since C∗ < C and K < C.
Since Equation (1) is not a differentiable equation [43], the soft minimum function [18] is adopted
to approximately compute Di,k . In detail,

where α is a precision control parameter of the approximation function. In the case of α → −∞,
Equation (2) approximates to Equation (1). In this article, we set α = −100 according to Reference
[18].
3.3 Similarity Minimization for EEG Channel Shapelets
To learn distinct shapelets for each EEG class, we consider to minimize similarities for shapelets
within and between EEG classes, as well introduced in Reference [56]. For k shapelets, their similarity matrix is defined as A ∈ Rk×k . Furthermore, let Ai,j ∈ A be the similarity between two
shapelets si and sj , and Ai,j can be computed as
Ai,j = e
− Qi,j 

σ 2 , (4)
where Qi,j can be computed as similarly as Equation (3).
3.4 Learning Shapelets
The shapelet-transformed distance matrix is regarded as EEG features, and we utilize a linear
classifier to predict the approximate target variable Yˆ ∈ RN ×C×K with D and linear classification
weightsW ∈ RK×V . In detail,
Yi,v = W0,v +

K
k=1
Di,kWk,v , ∀i ∈ {1, 2,..., N}, (5)
whereW0,v ∈ R denotes the bias for the vth class. And we also use a logistic function to transform
Equation (5). Namely,
Zˆ
i,v = eYi,v
1 + eYi,v , ∀i ∈ {1, 2,..., N}. (6)
Given that, EEG data commonly contain V classes, we can also transform the learning model
into a one-to-all binary problem. In detail,
Zi,v =

1, Zi = v
0, Zi  v ∀i ∈ {1, 2,..., N}, ∀v ∈ {1, 2,...,V }. (7)
Finally, we learn the model by minimizing the logistic loss between the true target Z and the
estimated one Zˆ,
L(Z,Zˆ) = −Z lnZˆ − (1 − Z) ln(1 − Zˆ). (8)
The aim of the article is to select more important EEG channels based on EEG shapelet learning.
Hence, we aim to minimize the logistic loss by jointly learning optimal EEG shapelets S, channel
contributions π, and the optimal hyperplaneW , simultaneously,

through minimizing their similarities.

3.5 Shapelet-transformed EEG Channel Selection
In our method, we apply gradient descent technique to solve the non-convex optimization objective function. As stated in Equation (9), it mainly contains three variables such as EEG shapelet
S, channel contribution π, and the optimal hyperplaneW . We update each of them with gradient
descent technique by, respectively, fixing the other two variables.
3.5.1 Shapelet Gradient. To analyze the gradients of the objective function with respect to S,
we first fix π andW , and then the objective function Equation (9) degenerates to Equation (10):

4 THE ALGORITHM
We first introduce the proposed algorithm StEEGCS for EEG channel selection in this section,
followed by its convergence analysis, model initialization, and computational complexity analysis.
4.1 StEEGCS
The algorithm we call StEEGCS is a gradient descent algorithm that iteratively learns the distinct
EEG shapelets S, channel contributions π, and linear hyperplane weightsW based on the gradient
descent technique. Finally, according to channel contributions π, csel ∈ Rsel with top-sel πc contribution channels for K shapelets can be selected out. Algorithm 1 shows the details, in which S,
π, and W are updated iteratively under the learning rate η. Finally, sel channels csel are selected
according to the top-sel channel contributions π.

4.2 Convergence Analysis
Algorithm 1 selectssel EEG channels with top-sel contributions for K shapelets by simultaneously
learning shapelets S, channel contributions π, and linear hyperplane W based on the gradient
descent strategy. As the objective function is non-convex, it, in the gradient descent strategy, just
can converge into a local optima under two parameters that interferes with each other, such as
the learning rate η and the maximum iteration Iiter . A proper setting of η and Iiter can obtain a
good convergence in a relatively short time. In particular, a larger η can help algorithm operate
less iterations to minimize the objective function (see Equation (9)), but it likely deteriorates the
convergence of the algorithm. On the contrary, if the algorithm aims to converge with a smaller
learning rate η, then it needs more iterations. Consequently, it is also a trade-off between learning
rate and maximum iteration to set for the algorithm. But considering the acceptable time cost to
converge, we recommend setting η = 0.01 and Iiter ≤ 100 in the article.
4.3 Model Initialization
The objective function (i.e., Equation (9)) is non-convex, so the gradient descent-based algorithm in
which the variables of shapelets S, channel contributions π, and linear hyperplaneW are required

58:10 C. Dai et al.
to learn simultaneously just converges to the local optima. The gradient descent strategy to solely
learn each of them cannot guarantee the global optima of objective function, but it is also widely
applied to solve non-convex problems as a trade-off technique. In practice, the performance of
gradient descent-based algorithm is significantly influenced by initializations of its parameters that
we are addressing in the section. As the patterns of every EEG class can be represented by their
centroid, for S0, it is initialized by the k-means centroid that contains same length of segments
from EEG data. Then, according to the initialization of shapelets S, the original EEG data can
be represented by the shapelet-transformed matrix D. To initialize channel contribution π0, we
transformed the average distances between shapelets and EEG channel segment to its initialization
contributions with sigmoid function, i.e., π0 (i) = sigmoid( 1

EEG channel, and Di,k refers to Equation (2)). And W 0 is simply randomly initialized close to 0
based on a normal distribution.
4.4 Computational Complexity

5 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this section, we first introduce the details of EEG datasets, evaluation methodology, and baseline
methods. Then, we carry out a detailed experimentation to compare the proposed StEEGCS with
state-of-the-art EEG channel selection approaches on several real-world EEG datasets.
5.1 EEG Datasets
Ten EEG datasets are used to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method, including the slow
cortical potentials (SCPs), motor imagery EEG, and wrist movement EEG data. All the EEG
datasets and their detailed descriptions are publicly available as online archives at http://www.bbci.
etition/ii/ (Dataset:II) and http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/ (Ddataset:IV), respectively. To evaluate EEG channel selection methods with respect to classification accuracy, we randomly divide
the original EEG dataset into two parts: training dataset and testing one. All the selection methods
are operated on the training data and evaluated with the testing one. The detailed descriptions of
each EEG dataset are shown in Table 1.
5.2 Baselines
To further establish the superiority of StEEGCS for EEG channel selection, we compare it to several
classic and state-of-the-art approaches, such as CSP [51], RCSP [12], SCSP [4], IMOCS [19], and
CCSE [53].
CSP: Common spatial pattern operates on a covariance matrix between EEG channels. In detail,
it is effective in discriminating two classes of EEG data by maximizing the variance of one class
while minimizing the variance of the other class. CSP-based channel selection method selects EEG
channels based on CSP coefficients, i.e., channels corresponding to maximal CSP vector coefficients
are selected as the optimal EEG channels.

RCSP: Regularized common spatial pattern-based algorithm selects EEG channels by inducing
the sparsity in the spatial filters, which actually uses 1-norm regularization. The solution of RCSP
is sparser than conventional CSP.
SCSP: Sparse common spatial pattern-based algorithm selects EEG channels by scattering the
common spatial filters within a constraint of classification accuracy. In detail, SCSP scatters the
CSP spatial filters to emphasize on a limited number of EEG channels with high variances between
classes, and to discard the rest of the channels with low variances.
IMOCS: Iterative multi-objective optimization for channel selection selects EEG channels by
first initializing a reference candidate solution and subsequently finding a set of most relevant
channels in an iterative manner.
CCSE: This method selects EEG channels via using correlation coefficient of spectral entropy
(CCSE). EEG channels are selected based on the ranking of correlation coefficient, in a way that the
spectral entropy of each channel across all frequencies is considered by taking sum of the squared
correlation coefficient.
Honestly, there are many classifiers for EEG time-series classification, including Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs)-based classifier [13], COTE [5], HIVE-COTE [34], St-TSC [33], RPCD [46], and
SAX-SEQL [39], but we just apply SVM classifier in the article, since (1) SVM is the most widely
used and promising classifier for EEG time-series classification; (2) as introduced in References
[9, 10] that SVM also performs as well as such classifiers as COTE, St-TSC, RPCD, and SAX-SEQL
on EEG classification; (3) besides, SVM also achieves the highest accuracy for EEG classification
compared with Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA), Generalized Andersonąŕs Task linear
classifier (GAT), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) [44]. Therefore, SVM classifier with LIBSVM
toolbox [8] was used in EEG classification step to assist to analyze the efficacy of channel selection
approaches. Additionally, SVM is operated 10 times on testing dataset and their average is reported
as the final classification accuracy.
For baseline methods, the parameters are tuned according to their original articles. For StEEGCS
learning shapelets, we set a minimum length of shapelets lmin = 10 to learn, and other shapelets
are expanded to different lengths by a scaler r ∈ Z+, i.e., {lmin,...,rlmin }. Besides, the weight
parameters λW and λS are searched in {10−4, 10−2, 100, 102, 104}, and the learning rate η is set as
η = 0.01.

5.3 Sensitivity Analysis
The StEEGCS is a shapelet-transformed EEG channel selection and the selected channels seem to
be influenced by channel contribution (i.e., channel weights), shapelet length, and shapelet number.
Hence, we respectively discuss their impacts in this section.
5.3.1 Impact of Shapelets on Channel Weights. We analyze the impact of shapelet length and
shapelet number on StEEGCS. We first show shapelets learned from each class of EEG datasets,
see Figure 2. Actually, we just show one EEG shapelet of each class in Figure 2, and it seems

to indicate that shapelet length of 30 contains better distinguishing patterns compared to other
shapelet lengths such as 10, 40, 60, and so on. In detail, a shorter shapelet (e.g., 10 or 20) cannot
clearly distinguish the patterns of different EEG channels, so it probably does not select the most
representative channels for EEG classification. Meanwhile, a longer shapelet probably contains
patterns that can be presented by a relatively shorter shapelet, such as 120 to 60, 60 to 30, so

it likely contains redundant patterns of EEG data. Besides, as introduced above, we only analyze
shapelet lengths of 10 at least while 50 or 120 at most for corresponding EEG datasets in the article.
Moreover, shapelet numbers are affected by shapelet length as well as the sample length of
each EEG channel. For example, learning too many shapelets (more than 5) with length of 120,
it may require more than 600 samples for each EEG channel, otherwise the learned shapelets are
not distinct with each other, since they probably overlap with each other or contain too many

redundant/common shapelet segments; if learning too many shapelets with length of 10, then
it can be transformed to learn a smaller amount of shapelets with longer shapelets such as 20,
30, or 60, and so on, since a longer shapelet probably contains several shorter shapelets. In other
words, learning too many shapelets no matter longer or shorter may be not good for learning
EEG channel weights and maybe finally degrade EEG classification. A larger number of shapelets
learned to select EEG channels seem to provide more redundant EEG patterns for classifier, and
it also costs more time. Consequently, we, according to the length of EEG shapelets and the

corresponding channel sample, we just discuss the impact of shapelet numbers from 1 to 5 on
EEG channel selection and classification.
StEEGCS selects EEG channel based on channel contributions (i.e., channel weights). In other
words, EEG channel weights are actually determined by EEG shapelets. Therefore, we analyze the
impact of shapelets on EEG channel weights, including shapelet length and shapelet number. The
results on 10 EEG datasets are shown in Figures 3–12, respectively. Generally, using 3 shapelets,
the discriminations among EEG channel weights are relatively more obvious than other numbers
of shapelets. Correspondingly, Figure 13 briefly illustrates the relationship between EEG channel

weights and shapelet lengths when fixing the number of learned shapelets as 3, and it shows that
shapelet length of 30 reflects relatively more distinguishing EEG channel weights for StEEGCS.
As we stated before, a large number of shapelets seem to contain redundant or less discriminative
patterns in EEG channel data while small numbers of shapelets may contain incomplete patterns
of EEG channel signals. Hence, both of the two situations result in relatively lower discrimination
among EEG channel weights, which probably influences the performance of channel selection and
classification. Similarly, short or long shapelets probably result in relatively lower discrimination
of EEG channel weights as well, since short shapelets (e.g., 10) may contain incomplete patterns of
EEG channel data while long shapelets (e.g., 90, 120), on the contrary, may contain redundant or
less discriminative EEG patterns. Consequently, according to the results in Figures 3–13, setting
EEG shapelet number as 3 and shapelet length as 30 for StEEGCS can get relatively the highest
discrimination EEG channel weights, which is beneficial to achieve best EEG classification.
5.3.2 Impact of Shapelets on Classification Performance. We discuss the impact of shapelet number and shapelet length on EEG classification performance, along with the number of selected EEG
channels. The impact of shapelet number (fixing shapelet length as 30 according the discussion in
Section 5.3.1) and shapelet length (fixing shapelet number as 3 according the discussion in Section 5.3.1) is displayed in Figures 14 and 15, respectively, both of which indicate that classification
performance is improved with a fewer EEG channels selected by StEEGCS, especially when the
number of selected EEG channels is 2, 3, or 4.
As illustrated in Figures 14 and 15, classification accuracies achieved with 3 shapelets of 30 are
relatively the highest in all conditions, in accord with the discussion in Section 5.3.1. In other
words, StEEGCS with a relatively small number of shapelets (i.e., 3) in a moderate length (i.e., 30)
can select the most relevant EEG channels for SVM classifier to yield the highest classification
accuracy.

5.4 Performance Comparison with Baselines
We, in this section, analyze the efficacy of our method StEEGCS with respect to classification accuracy by comparing it to baselines on 10 EEG datasets. As we concluded in Section 5.3 that 3
shapelets with length of 30 can select the most relevant EEG channels and yield the best classification performance with the selected EEG channels, we set shapelet length: 30 and shapelet number;
3 for StEEGCS.
5.4.1 Comparison with Non-selected EEG Channels. With SVM, we first analyze the impact of
StEEGCS selected EEG channels on EEG classification accuracy. The results, with 3 shapelets of
length 30, are shown in Figure 16, which indicates that the SVM-based classification accuracies
on all EEG datasets increase generally along with the number of selected EEG channels decreases.
Besides, Table 2 also shows that EEG classification accuracy with StEEGCS selected channels is

greatly improved by 9.5% at least for all EEG datasets, compared to those with non-selection channels (i.e., all channels). StEEGCS aims to search distinct EEG shapelets that represent the original
EEG data, to provide more informative EEG patterns for SVM classifier. In other words, as embedded with logistic loss, shapelet-transformed StEEGCS not only reduces redundancy of EEG
data but also strengthens important patterns for classifier modeling. Meanwhile, as the number of
selected EEG channels decreases, the efficiency of SVM classifier is correspondingly significantly
improved, compared to non-selection EEG channels, see Figure 17.
5.4.2 Comparison with EEG Channel Selection Baselines. To further establish the efficacy of
StEEGCS, we, with SVM classifier, compare it to other EEG channel selection methods such as
CSP, RCSP, SCSP, IMOCS, and CCSE. As applied to 10 EEG datasets, the classification results are

StEEGCS selected channels is generally higher than those of other channel selection methods. Additionally, we also compare their averages and standard deviations of all classification accuracies

achieved with different selected EEG channels on each EEG dataset, i.e., the averages and standard deviations of all classification for each channel selection method. The results are shown in
Table 3, which demonstrates that on all EEG datasets, StEEGCS assists SVM classifier to achieve
the best averaged classification accuracy. Moreover, the best and worst classification accuracies
with correspondingly selected EEG channels are also displayed in Table 4, which also indicates

that StEEGCS is the best method for EEG channel selection, compared to different baselines, since
it yields the highest classification accuracy on all EEG datasets no matter in best or worst situation. Besides, we also analyze the significance of StEEGCS over baselines for EEG channel selection
by using one-tailed t-test (α = 0.05) on their classification accuracy; see Table 5. The p-values in
Table 5 demonstrate the classification performance achieved by StEEGCS is significantly different
to those baseline methods on most of EEG datasets, especially some of which are extremely significantly different. In other words, Table 5 indicates that StEEGCS outperforms baselines for EEG
channel selection with respect to classification accuracy.
In addition, we also accordingly compare the execution time of EEG channel selection approaches, and the result is illustrated in Figure 19. As Figure 19 indicates, StEEGCS costs the most
for EEG channel selection on most of EEG datasets. As introduced in Section 4.4, the computational
complexity of StEEGCS is O(Iiter (nvkc2
l
3 + nvck3
l
3)), and it shows that the time consumption
of StEEGCS is mainly determined by optimal shapelet learning, which requires many iterations
(or time) to find the optimal length and number of shapelets. But StEEGCS has competitive EEG
channel selection efficiency to IMOCS and CCSE. Anyway, considering its superior classification
performance, StEEGCS’s execution time for EEG channel selection is acceptable.
6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
Multi-channel EEG is widely applied in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), but analyzing EEG
signals with too many channels likely results in computational cost and inconvenience for BCI
applications. EEG channel selection is a way to deal with the issue. Besides, as many studies

reported before, EEG channel selection can not only improve the BCI performance by removing
irrelevant or redundant EEG channels but also enhance convenience for BCI applications with less
EEG channels. Hence, we proposed an EEG shapelet-transformed channel selection approach that
we call StEEGCS, which first used EEG shapelets to represent original EEG data, and subsequently

channels to classification performance are selected for SVM classifier. The experimental results on
several real-world EEG datasets demonstrated that StEEGCS improves the classification accuracy
and efficiency by selecting a small amount of EEG channels and outperforms the classic and
state-of-the-art EEG channel selection methods with respect to SVM classification performance.
In the article, gradient descent is adopted in StEEGCS that probably leads to local optima, so
other techniques such as heuristic approach should be considered to solve the non-convex minimization objective function of logistic loss for StEEGCS. Besides, as many promising classifiers
emerged, it would be interesting to apply new classifiers, such as DNNs, HIVE-COTE, and so on,
mentioned in Section 5.2, to analyze the universality of StEEGCS in future work. Additionally, we
also intend to exploit more efficient EEG shapelet transforming/learning/selection approaches to
extract distinct and informative EEG shapelets in the future, such as References [11, 25, 32, 42],
and so on.
