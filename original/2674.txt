Adverse drug-drug interaction (ADDI) is referred to as a situation where the unpleasant or adverse effects caused by the co-administration of two drugs, which becomes a significant problem for public health. With the increasing availability of healthcare data, many methods are proposed for ADDI prediction. However, these methods usually work in a “nondiscriminatory” manner, i.e., they treat each feature without discrimination and equally incorporate all features into the predictive models. In practice, only a few features are essentially discriminative and relevant to ADDIs. In this paper, we propose a Dependence Guided Discriminative Feature Selection (DGDFS) model for ADDI prediction. In DGDFS, two drug attributes, molecular structure and side effect are adopted to model the adverse interaction among drugs and l2,0 -norm equality constraints are introduced to select discriminative molecular substructures and side effects for ADDI prediction. Besides, three dependence guided terms, i.e., the dependence between molecular structure and ADDI, the dependence between side effect and ADDI, and the dependence between molecular structure and side effect, are designed to guide feature selection. An iterative algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers is developed for optimization. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of DGDFS compared with fourteen baselines and its three variants.
SECTION 1Introduction
During pharmacotherapy, adverse drug reaction (ADR) is known as the harmful effects caused by individual drugs or drug combinations, which becomes an important clinical problem for public health and a significant financial burden for healthcare systems [1]. In the United States, ADRs are estimated to result in more than 2 million hospitalizations and 100,000 deaths per year and wipe about $136 billion from healthcare annual budget [2]. As one of the main concerns in ADRs, adverse drug-drug interaction is responsible for 30 percent of the reported ADRs and referred to as a situation where the unpleasant or adverse effects caused by the co-administration of two drugs [3], leading to dangerous reactions and inevitable damages to patients’ health [4]. A typical example is that Aspirin, an analgesic-antipyretic, taken along with Warfarin, a kind of blood-thinning drugs, may result in epigastric pain and gastrointestinal hemorrhage [5]. Although the detection of ADDIs is conducted in the vitro experiments during the preclinical stage of drug developments, there are still a number of new ADDIs discovered by accident after drugs hit the market [6]. Their occurrences primarily lie on the complex interactions between drugs and human body [7], which makes it difficult for the vitro experiments to simulate the vivo environments for exploring ADDIs in advance [8], [9]. These undetected ADDIs delay the disease treatments, aggravate the illness conditions, and increase the morbidity and mortality of patients, which brings an urgency to predict ADDIs before the medications are administered for preventing this life-threatening issue and enhancing the safety of pharmacotherapy in clinical treatments [2], [6].

In the past few years, many approaches have been proposed for ADDI identification and prediction. Some researchers focus on evaluating the metabolic profiles [10] or analyzing transporter-associated pharmacokinetic interactions [11]. However, these laboratory-based methods are limited in poor statistical significance, tremendous research costs, and high time consumption [3], [4]. With the rapid accumulation and increasing availability of healthcare data in biomedical text, electronic medical records, and the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS) [12], [13], it is feasible for researchers to design knowledge-based methods for ADDI prediction, which usually involve signal detection [2], entity extraction [14], [15], and semantic analysis techniques [16]. These methods are effective in detecting hidden ADDIs buried in sufficient clinical evidence, being regarded as a post-marketing surveillance, but are incapable of predicting potential ADDIs before the ADDI events, serving as a pre-marketing alert.

Based on the assumption that ADDIs are essentially caused by the attribute conflicts between two drugs [17], similarity-based methods are developed for early ADDI prediction [18], [19], [20]. These methods usually first extract drug attributes (e.g., molecular structure, target, enzyme, pathway, etc.) from medical databases (e.g., DrugBank [21], PubChem [22], KEGG [23], etc.), and then compute similarity scores among drugs to be used as inputs for machine learning classifiers. Recent researches show that integrating multiple drug attributes into the same model can enhance the prediction performance [10], [24]. The success of similarity-based methods mainly relies on the extensive studies on biochemical characteristics of drugs [20], [25], which reduces the research expenditures for drug developments, provides the appropriate guidances for treatments, and improves the safe medications for healthcare systems.

Despite the impressive results achieved by the current researches, they still have several limitations:

Most methods typically employ biochemical-based attributes for ADDI prediction. However, side effect of drugs is another critical factor that is responsible for many ADDIs [18]. To be specific, the interaction between two drugs may aggravate their respective side effects and result in significant ADDIs [26]. For example, the combination of Aspirin and Warfarin can aggravate the gastrointestinal discomfort caused by Aspirin and worsen the intestinal wall edema caused by Warfarin, which increases the risks of epigastric pain and gastrointestinal hemorrhage induced by their co-administration [5].

They generally focus on exploring the dependence between drug attributes and ADDI so as to reveal the adverse relationship among drugs. In fact, there are also implicit dependence among different attributes [27], which is not considered in the current predictive models. Recent studies show that the biochemical activities of drugs are highly dependent on the molecular structure of drugs [28], which is also an essential factor that accounts for their therapeutic and side effects [29]. It is believed that integrating attribute dependence into the predictive models can not only help uncover the implicit information about ADDIs but also be beneficial to ADDI prediction.

Most importantly, the current methods usually work in a “nondiscriminatory” manner, i.e., each feature is treated without discrimination and all features are equally incorporated into the predictive models.1 In practice, the feature spaces for drug attributes are commonly high dimensional and only a few features are essentially discriminative and relevant to ADDIs [30], [31], [32]. On the other hand, the high dimensional feature spaces generally carry redundant information, which enhances computational costs and degrades prediction results [33], [34], [35]. To our best knowledge, no previous work has incorporated discriminative feature selection into ADDI prediction.

To solve the abovementioned problems, we propose a Dependence Guided Discriminative Feature Selection model for ADDI prediction. In DGDFS, two drug attributes, molecular structure and side effect are adopted to model the adverse interaction among drugs,2 since the incompatibility of molecular structures and the aggravation of side effects are essential factors for ADDI modeling [18], [19], [26]. Fig. 1 presents the schematic of molecular structures and side effects for Aspirin and Warfarin, respectively. Due to that the biochemical activities of a drug are usually associated with a few privileged molecular substructures [31] and the adverse reactions caused by a drug are often related to a few significant side effects [32], we introduce l2,0-norm equality constraints to select discriminative molecular substructures and side effects for ADDI prediction. Different from the previous feature selection models that usually construct a projection matrix to map from the original feature space to the selected feature space and use l2,1-norm to ensure the sparsity of the selected features, DGDFS is a projection-free feature selection model with the adoption of l2,0-norm equality constraints. Furthermore, three dependence guided terms, i.e., the dependence between molecular structure and ADDI, the dependence between side effect and ADDI, and the dependence between molecular structure and side effect, are designed to guide feature selection. To solve the optimization problem of DGDFS, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm based on the method of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) [36]. Experimental results on real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of DGDFS in ADDI prediction when compared with the state-of-the-art ADDI prediction methods, feature selection models as well as three variants of DGDFS.

The main contributions of this paper are summarized as:

Based on l2,0-norm equality constraints, a projection-free feature selection model DGDFS is proposed, which aims to select discriminative molecular substructures and side effects for ADDI prediction.

Three dependence guided terms, including the dependence between drug attributes (molecular structure and side effect) and ADDI and the dependence between these two attributes, are designed to guide feature selection.

An efficient iterative algorithm based on the ADMM method is developed to solve the optimization problem of DGDFS. The experimental results on the real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of DGDFS.

SECTION 2Related Work
2.1 ADDI Prediction
ADDI prediction is one of the critical issues in the field of ADR research. For knowledge-based methods, Tatonetti et al. [2] proposed a statistical correction of uncharacterized bias method to predict ADDIs by removing synthetic associations, co-prescriptions, and hidden covariates from prescriptions. By applying the method to electronic medical records, they confirmed 47 existed ADDIs with great statistical significance. The authors in [16] developed a semantic web-based approach to mine significant ADDIs induced by adverse drug events, which can be regarded as translational and pharmacovigilance studies of drugs. With the increasing popularity of deep learning techniques, researchers propose to apply convolution neural networks [14], recurrent neural networks [37], and long short term memory neural networks [15] to adverse event reports [13], biomedical text [38], and tweet posts [39] for ADDI prediction, which also achieve encouraging results.

To solve the problem of knowledge-based methods in early ADDI prediction, similarity-based methods are proposed based on the biochemical characteristics of drugs [3], [10], [24], [40]. Jin et al. [3] designed a multi-task dyadic regression method to detect multiple types of ADDIs, in which the detection for each type of ADDI is regarded as a regression task. By integrating phenotypic, therapeutic, molecular structure, and genomic similarities, Cheng and Zhao [10] applied five machine learning algorithms in the heterogeneous network-assisted inference framework to identify potential ADDIs. Based on the artificial neural network and factor propagation over network, Shtar et al. [24] designed two adjacent matrix factorization models AMF and AMFP to predict unknown ADDIs from the drug interaction network. Ryu et al. [40] designed a deep learning framework by incorporating molecular structures and drug names as inputs for predicting ADDIs associated with 191,878 drug pairs. In this paper, we primarily focus on similarity-based methods and develop a dependence guided discriminative feature selection model for ADDI prediction.

2.2 Feature Selection
Since high-dimensional datasets become common in many machine learning applications, feature selection is developed to reduce the dimensionality of datasets so as to keep useful information and remove unrelevant noise [33], [34]. Based on whether label information is available or not, feature selection can be generally grouped into two major categories: supervised [35], [41] and unsupervised approaches [42], [43], [44]. On the other hand, current feature selection methods can also be categorized as filter methods [45], wrapper methods [35], and embedded methods [46], [47]. Most embedded methods usually project the original feature space into the selected feature space and adopt l2,1-norm to ensure the sparsity of the selected features so as to convert feature selection to a convex optimization problem [41], [44], [47]. In this way, discriminative features can be selected by high-scores based on the predefined metrics, such as Laplacian score [48], row/column-wise l2-norm of the feature matrix [43], and projection matrix [49], etc.

In the past decade, feature selection has been extensively applied in bioinformatics fields, including protein sequence analysis, DNA microarray study, and biomedical image processing [50], [51], due to that it can reduce the dimensionality of bioinformatics data and help explore the significant biological factors in learning models [52]. In the problem of ADDI prediction, the feature spaces for drug attributes are commonly high dimensional and only a few features are essentially relevant to ADDIs [30], [31], [32], which brings a great necessity to explore optimal feature subsets and select discriminative drug features so as to reduce the computational costs and enhance the performance of learning models in ADDI prediction [33], [35]. To this end, a discriminative feature selection model is proposed under the guidance of the dependence between attributes and ADDI as well as the dependence between molecular structure and side effect for ADDI prediction.

SECTION 3The Proposed DGDFS Model
3.1 Notation
We use bold upper-case characters to represent matrices (e.g., U), bold lower-case characters to denote vectors (e.g., u), and lower-case characters to represent scalars (e.g., u). For an arbitrary matrix U∈RM×N, Uij denotes the (i,j)-th entry of U, Ui and Uj represent the i-th row and the j-th column of U, respectively. UT, U−1, and rank(U) are defined as the transpose, inverse, and rank of U, respectively. Tr(U) is the trace of matrix U, if M=N. The Frobenius norm of matrix U is denoted as ||U||F=∑Mi∑NjU2ij−−−−−−−−−−√. The l2,1-norm and the l1,2-norms of matrix U are defined as ||U||2,1=∑Mi=1∑Nj=1U2ij−−−−−−−−√=∑Mi||Ui||2 and ||U||1,2=∑Nj=1∑Mi=1U2ij−−−−−−−√=∑Nj||Uj||2, where ||Ui||2 and ||Uj||2 are the l2-norm of Ui and Uj, respectively. The l2,0-norm of matrix U is denoted as ||U||2,0=∑Mi||∑NjU2ij||0, where for a scalar u, if u≠0, then ||u||0=1; otherwise ||u||0=0.

3.2 Model Formulation
Let D={d1,d2,…,dN} be a set of N drugs. Some pairs of drugs are detected as adverse drug pairs that result in adverse interactions. We use matrix R∈{0,1}N×N to represent the adverse interaction among drugs such that if drug pair (di,dj) causes an adverse interaction, then Rij=Rji=1; otherwise Rij=Rji=0. In this paper, two drug attributes, molecular structure and side effect, are adopted to model the adverse interaction among drugs, due to that ADDIs are usually caused by the incompatibility of molecular structures [19] and the aggravation of side effects [18], [26]. Each drug is associated with an M-dimensional molecular structure space and an L-dimensional side effect space. Here, we use matrices U∈RM×N and V∈RL×N to represent the original molecular structure and side effect spaces of drugs, respectively.

Recent studies on biochemical characteristics of drugs have shown that the biochemical activities of a drug are usually related to a few privileged molecular substructures [31] and the adverse reactions caused by a drug are often associated with a few significant side effects [32]. These results indicate that ADDIs are generally caused by a few discriminative molecular substructures and side effects. In other words, the feature spaces for molecular structure and side effect are high dimensional, but only a few molecular substructures and side effects are essentially discriminative and relevant to ADDIs [26], [30]. Therefore, we aim at simultaneously selecting M¯ (M¯<M) most discriminative molecular substructures and L¯ (L¯<L) most discriminative side effects for ADDI prediction, which is formulated as
 s.t.  PQminP,Q   F(U,P,V,Q)=diag(s)U, s∈{0,1}M, sT1M=M¯,=diag(y)V, y∈{0,1}L,  yT1L=L¯,(1)
View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.where matrices P∈RM×N and Q∈RL×N are the selected molecular structure and side effect spaces of drugs, respectively, F(U,P,V,Q) is the discriminative feature selection function for ADDI prediction, diag(s) returns a diagonal matrix with its diagonal elements being the entries of vector s, and 1M is an all-one vector with the length of M. Due to the additional constraints imposed on matrices P and Q, Eq. (1) is regarded as a mixed integer programming problem. To this end, previous embedded feature selection methods usually construct a projection matrix W to map from the original feature spaces to the selected feature spaces (i.e., P≈UW and Q≈VW) and adopt l2,1-norm to ensure the sparsity of the selected features so as to convert Eq. (1) to a convex optimization problem [41], [44], [47]. However, these methods are incapable of directly selecting the number of features in the optimization process.

Since vectors s and y are binary, it can inferred that (M−M¯) rows of matrix diag(s) and (L−L¯) rows of matrix diag(y) are all zeros. Furthermore, matrix P can be constructed by setting (M−M¯) rows of matrix U to be zeros and the remaining M¯ rows to be identical to U, and matrix Q can be constructed by setting (L−L¯) rows of matrix V to be zeros and the remaining L¯ rows to be consistent with V. In this way, a projection-free feature selection model can be introduced by imposing l2,0-norm equality constraints on matrices P and Q, respectively. In addition, as matrices P and Q can be derived from matrices U and V, respectively, we set rank(P)=rank(U) and rank(Q)=rank(V) as additional constraints so as to ensure that the critical drug information in the original molecular structure and side effect spaces can be well preserved in the selected molecular structure and side effect spaces, respectively.3 Therefore, Eq. (1) can be rewritten as follows:
s.t.  ||U−P||2,0||V−Q||2,0minP,Q F(U,P,V,Q)=M−M¯, ||P||2,0=M¯, rank(P)=rank(U),=L − L¯, ||Q||2,0=L¯,  rank(Q)=rank(V).(2)

Different from the previous l2,1-norm based feature selection methods, the proposed DGDFS model is free of projection and capable of selecting the number of molecular substructures and side effects in the optimization process for ADDI prediction.

3.3 Dependence Between Drug Attributes and ADDI
In this subsection, we aim to model the dependence between drug attributes and ADDI so as to guide feature selection. Previous studies have shown that the drug pair with adverse interaction is more likely to own high molecular structure dissimilarity than the one without adverse interaction [19]. Fig. 2 presents the molecular structures of Bisoprolol (an anti-hypertensive drug) and Diltiazem (a drug used to treat coronary heart disease). It can be seen that their molecular structures are remarkably different in terms of the number of chemical elements and the binding modes among molecular groups. Since matrix P denotes the selected molecular structure space of drugs, we use (Pi)TPj to present the molecular structure similarity between drug di and drug dj. Therefore, the dependence between molecular structure and ADDI can be mathematically formulated by solving the following term:
D1=minP∑iN∑jN(Pi)TPjRij=minPTr(PTPR).(3)

Bisoprolol is an anti-hypertensive drug and Diltiazem is used to treat coronary heart disease. The co-administration of Bisoprolol and Diltiazem may impact cardiac contractility and lead to pruritus, insomnia, hypotension, and atrioventricular block [53].

Show All

As mentioned above, many ADDIs are essentially caused by the aggravation of side effects. Especially, when two drugs simultaneously lead to the same or similar side effects, the interaction between them may amplify their respective side effects and finally result in severe ADDIs [18], [26]. For example, both Bisoprolol and Diltiazem own the side effects of erythra and bradycardia, which accounts for their adverse interactions such as pruritus and atrioventricular block. In terms of Aspirin and Warfarin shown in Fig. 1, the side effects of Aspirin (e.g., blood stasis and alimentary tract edema) are very similar to these of Warfarin (e.g., ecchymosis and intestinal wall edema), which enhances the risks of gastrointestinal hemorrhage caused by their co-administration. Therefore, it can be inferred that the drug pair with adverse interaction is more likely to own high side effect similarity than the one without adverse interaction. Due to that matrix Q represents the selected side effect space of drugs, (Qi)TQj can be regarded as the side effect similarity between drug di and drug dj. In this way, the dependence between side effect and ADDI can be formulated as follows:
D2=maxQ∑iN∑jN(Qi)TQjRij=maxQTr(QTQR).(4)

3.4 Dependence Between Molecular Structure and Side Effect
Molecular structure is an important drug attribute that is highly relevant to many drug attributes, including side effect [27], [28], [29]. In this subsection, we use Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) [54] to measure the dependence between the selected molecular structure space P and the selected side effect space Q.

HSIC is a kernel-based approach that computes the Hilbert-Schmidt-norm of the cross-covariance operator to measure dependence between two random variables in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs) [54]. Given a space P, Hilbert space Y is the RKHS of P when there corresponds a mapping ϕ(p)∈Y such that k(p,p′)=⟨ϕ(p),ϕ(p′)⟩Y, where p,p′∈P, and k:P×P→R is a unique positive definite kernel function. Likewise, another RKHS V can be defined in space Q with a mapping ψ(q)∈V and a kernel function l(q,q′)=⟨ψ(q),ψ(q′)⟩V, q,q′∈Q. Given the domain P×Q, the empirical HSIC value of the RKHSs can be estimated by a finite number of samples. Let {(p1,q1),(p2,q2),…,(pN,qN)}∈P×Q be a set of N independent observations obtained from the joint distribution ξP×Q. Therefore, the estimated HSIC value can be computed as HSIC(ξP×Q,Y,V)=1(N−1)2Tr(KHLH), where K,L,H∈RN×N, Kij=k(pi,pj), Lij=l(qi,qj), and Hij=δij−1N. δij is Kronecker delta function.

According to [54], the maximization of the estimated HSIC value is equivalent to the maximization of the dependence between two random variables. Here, we set the kernel functions for RKHSs Y and V as k(pi,pj)=(pi)Tpj and l(qi,qj)=(qi)Tqj, respectively. Therefore, the dependence between the selected molecular structure space P and the selected side effect space Q can be written as follows:
D3=maxP,QTr(PTPHQTQH).(5)

3.5 Self-Representation of Drug Attributes
Based on l2,0-norm equality constraints, we propose a projection-free feature selection model under the guidance of the dependence between drug attributes and ADDI as well as the dependence between molecular structure and side effect. In practice, drugs are usually used in combination with others in most cases and the attribute representations of drugs do not deviate significantly from the majority of other drugs [55]. One natural strategy can be designed to reconstruct the selected feature spaces by some representative drugs. To be specific, the molecular structure vector Pi and the side effect vector Qi of drug di can be represented by the corresponding vectors of these representative drugs. Therefore, the self-representation of drug attributes can be formulated as follows:
minP,Q,W||P−PWT||2F+||Q−QWT||2F+γ||W||1,2,(6)
View Sourcewhere W∈RN×N is a coefficient matrix such that the selected molecular structure and side effect spaces can be self-represented by the linear combination of the representative drugs, ||W||1,2 ensures that only the molecular structure and side effect vectors of a few representative drugs can be employed to reconstruct the corresponding feature spaces, parameter γ controls the column sparsity of matrix W.

3.6 Objective Function of DGDFS
By incorporating the three dependence guided terms Eqs. (3), (4), and (5) and the self-representation term Eq. (6) into the projection-free feature selection model in Eq. (2), we present the framework of DGDFS model in Fig. 3 and formulate its objective function as follows:
minP,Q,W α[Tr(PTPR)−Tr(QTQR)]−(1−α)Tr(PTPHQTQH)+β(||P−PWT||2F+||Q−QWT||2F)+γ||W||1,2s.t.  ||U−P||2,0=M−M¯, ||P||2,0=M¯, rank(P)=rank(U),||V−Q||2,0=L − L¯, ||Q||2,0=L¯,  rank(Q)=rank(V),(7)

In addition, the selected molecular structure and side effect spaces ${\mathbf P}$P and ${\mathbf Q}$Q can be self-represented by a linear combination of the corresponding vectors of a few representative drugs.

4.3 Update Matrix W
The objective function in Eq. (7) w.r.t. matrix W can be written as follows:
β(||P−PWT||2F+||Q−QWT||2F)+γ||W||1,2.(35)
View SourceBy first calculating the partial derivative of Eq. (35) w.r.t. matrix W and then setting the partial derivative to be zero, we derive the update rule for W as
W=β(PTP+QTQ)[β(PTP+QTQ)+γDw]−1,(36)
View Sourcewhere Dw is a diagonal matrix with its diagonal element (Dw)ii=12||Wi||2+τ 4. The time complexity of the inverse operation in Eq. (36) is O(N3). As matrix (PTP+QTQ) is symmetric, we consider the approximation (PTP+QTQ)≈FTF, F∈RN′×N, N′≪N, in which matrix F can be derived by first using the SVD method to factorize (PTP+QTQ) and then selecting the singular vectors corresponding to the top N′ singular values. Following Woodbury matrix identity, we have
[β(PTP+QTQ)+γDw]−1=1γD−1w−βγ2D−1wFT(I+βγFD−1wFT)−1FD−1w.(37)
View SourceIn this way, the time complexity of the inverse operation in Eq. (36) can be reduced to O(N2N′).

With the update rules for matrices P, Q, and W, the detailed optimization algorithm for DGDFS is described in Algorithm 1. At each iteration, the time complexity for updating P, Zp, and Yp is O(N2M+NML) and the time complexity for updating Q, Zq, and Yq is O(N2L+NML). In addition, it requires O[N2(M+L+N′)] to update W by Eqs. (36) and (37). Therefore, the total time complexity for the optimization algorithm of DGDFS is O[N2(M+L+N′)+NML].

4.4 Convergence Analysis
In this paper, the ADMM method is adopted to solve the optimization problem w.r.t. matrices P and Q. Nevertheless, it should be noteworthy that there is no established theorem for the guarantee of the convergence of the ADMM method [36]. In the experiments, we find that the developed optimization algorithm does converge given appropriate penalty parameter ρ and initial values of auxiliary matrices (Zp, Yp, Zq, and Yq) and scaled dual matrices (Λp, Γp, Λq, and Γq). In this subsection, we mainly discuss the convergence property of the update rule for matrix W in the following.

Lemma 1.
For non-zero vectors Wi(t) and Wi(t+1), the following inequality holds [33]:
||W(t+1)||1,2−∑i||Wi(t+1)||222||Wi(t)||2≤||W(t)||1,2−∑i||Wi(t)||222||Wi(t)||2,(38)
View Sourcewhere W(t) is the t-th iteration of matrix W, and Wi(t) is the i-th column of matrix W(t).

Theorem 3.
The objective function in Eq. (35) is monotonically non-increasing under the update rule Eq. (36) for matrix W.

Proof.
When matrices P and Q are fixed, according to Eq. (36), W(t+1) is the solution of the following objective function:
minWβ(||P−PWT||2F+||Q−QWT||2F)+γTr[WTWDw(t)],(39)
View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.where Dw(t) is the t-th iteration of matrix Dw.

Therefore, we derive the following inequality:
β[||P−PW(t+1)T||2F+||Q−QW(t+1)T||2F]+γTr[W(t+1)TW(t+1)Dw(t)]≤β[||P−PW(t)T||2F+||Q−QW(t)T||2F]+γTr[W(t)TW(t)Dw(t)],(40)
View Sourcewhich is equivalent to:
β[||P−PW(t+1)T||2F+||Q−QW(t+1)T||2F]+γ||W(t+1)||1,2−γ{||W(t+1)||1,2−Tr[W(t+1)TW(t+1)Dw(t)]}≤β[||P−PW(t)T||2F+||Q−QW(t)T||2F]+γ||W(t)||1,2−γ{||W(t)||1,2−Tr[W(t)TW(t)Dw(t)].(41)
View SourceBy integrating Eq. (41) into Lemma 1, we have
β[||P−PW(t+1)T||2F+||Q−QW(t+1)T||2F]+γ||W(t+1)||1,2≤β[||P−PW(t)T||2F+||Q−QW(t)T||2F]+γ||W(t)||1,2,(42)

SECTION 5Experiments
In this section, extensive experiments are conducted on the real-world dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed DGDFS model. All experiments are implemented on a PC with Python 3.6 under Windows 8.1 with Intel (R), 3.30 GHz and 16 GB real memory.5

5.1 Dataset
FAERS6 is a public database that records adverse event reports, medication error reports, and quality complaints for biological products submitted to FDA. Mining from FAERS, Tatonetti et al. [12] constructed Twosides database containing the polypharmacy adverse interactions caused by the co-administration of two drugs. The molecular structure of drugs can be extracted from DrugBank [21], which is a unique bioinformatics and cheminformatics resource that combines drug data with detailed drug-target information. The canonical SMILES for each drug is extracted from DrugBank and PubChem substructure fingerprints [22] are adopted to build the original molecular structure space U. Each drug is represented by an 881 dimensional binary vector (M=881) such that if drug dj owns the i-th molecular substructure, then Uij=1; otherwise Uij=0. SIDER is a database that records the side effects of 1,430 drugs [58], which can be exploited to construct the original side effect space V. Each drug is coded as a 1,938 dimensional binary vector (L=1938) such that if drug dj leads to the i-th side effect, then Vij=1; otherwise Vij=0. In this paper, 104,324 ADDIs are extracted from Twosides to construct adverse interaction matrix R associated with N=565 drugs that are common across Twosides, DrugBank, and SIDER. The ratio of positive and negative samples in our dataset is 0.485. It can be computed that rank(U)=482 and rank(V)=554.

5.2 Comparison Algorithms
We compare DGDFS with the following fourteen baselines for performance evaluation. The comparison methods can be classified into two categories. The first eight methods are the state-of-the-art ADDI prediction methods, while the last six ones are feature selection models. Since feature selection models cannot be directly adopted for ADDI prediction, in our experiments, we first use each model to select discriminative molecular substructures and side effects, and then utilize the selected features for ADDI prediction.

LSSM [19] is a large-scale learning model by computing the molecular structure similarities among drugs for ADDI analysis and prediction.

LPSE [18] is a label propagation ADDI prediction method based on the clinical side effects of drugs.

MDRM [3] utilizes a multitask dyadic regression model that incorporates molecular structures of drugs into ADDI prediction.

DLM [40] is a deep learning model that adopts molecular structures and names of drugs to predict adverse drug-drug and drug-food interactions.

AMFP [24] is an adjacency matrix factorization model that is based on the artificial neural network and factor propagation for ADDI prediction.

ADFN [25] is a deep learning model that uses autoencoders and a deep feed-forward network for accurate ADDI prediction.

MLMS [10] is a machine learning based ADDI prediction method by integrating multiple attribute similarities among drugs.

MSLS [17] models multiple attribute similarities of drugs and introduces an applicable protocol for large-scale ADDI prediction.

SDFS [47] is a sparse discriminative feature selection model constrained by l2,1-norm minimization.

NDFS [49] adopts joint l2,1-norm regularized regression and nonnegative spectral analysis for feature selection.

RUFSM [42] utilizes matrix factorization for robust unsupervised feature selection regularized by l2,1-norm.

EUFS [43] is an embedded unsupervised feature selection model by joint l2,1-norm minimization and graph embedding.

RUFS [46] is a reconstruction-based unsupervised feature selection model that embeds reconstruction function learning process into feature selection.

SSDFS [41] utilizes orthogonal linear discriminant analysis for self-weighted supervised discriminative feature selection.

Among the compared ADDI prediction methods, the first four methods adopt one drug attribute, while AMFP, ADFN, MLMS, and MSLS employ multiple attributes for ADDI prediction. Meanwhile, DLM, AMFP, and ADFN are deep learning based methods, and the remaining five methods are not. In terms of the six feature selection models, SDFS and SSDFS are supervised models, while NDFS, RUFSM, EUFS, and RUFS are unsupervised ones. Additionally, to further validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we also compare DGDFS with its following three variants for analyzing the effects of the dependence between molecular structure and side effect, the self-representation of drug attributes, and the preservation of critical drug information on ADDI prediction.

DGDFS-D only considers the dependence between drug attributes and ADDI but does not incorporate the dependence between the molecular structure and the side effect. Here, we set α=1.

DGDFS-R models the adverse interaction among drugs without the consideration of the self-representation of drug attributes. We set parameters β and γ to be 0.

DGDFS-S is another variant of DGDFS. In DGDFS-S, the critical drug information in the original molecular structure and side effect spaces is not preserved in the selected molecular structure and side effect spaces. Parameter μ is set to be 0.

5.3 Experimental Setting
We adopt 10-fold cross validation to evaluate the prediction results of different methods. To be specific, the ADDI dataset is split into 10 folds and in each experiment, we iteratively hold 9 folds and their corresponding molecular structures and side effects for training, and adopt the remaining fold for testing. For a fair comparison, seven metrics, i.e., Specificity, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-score, AUC, and AUPR are adopted to measure the prediction results. According to the ground-truth and the results output by prediction methods, there are four possible outcomes: (1) an ADDI is recognized as an ADDI (TP); (2) an ADDI is recognized as a non-ADDI (FN); (3) a non-ADDI is recognized as an ADDI (FP); (4) a non-ADDI is recognized as a non-ADDI (TN). Therefore, we have Specificity =TNTN+FP, Accuracy =TP+TNTP+FN+FP+TN, Precision =TPTP+FP, Recall =TPTP+FN, and F-score =2×Precision×RecallPrecision+Recall. AUC is the area under the ROC curve, which is a plot of true positive rate (i.e., Recall) versus false positive rate (FPFP+TN). AUPR is the area under the Precision-Recall curve. The higher the values of the metrics, the better the prediction performance of a method.

Each comparison algorithm owns different regularization parameters. For ADDI prediction methods, we set their parameters following the experimental settings in the previous works. In terms of feature selection models, we fix the neighborhood size to be 5 for NDFS, RUFSM, EUFS, and RUFS. Meanwhile, a grid search strategy is adopted to tune the regularization parameters. For each algorithm, we use 10-fold cross validation to determine the parameters chosen from {0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 100, 500, 1000} and report the best results. In DGDFS, parameter α ranges from {0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0} and the number of selected molecular substructures M¯ and the number of selected side effects L¯ are set as {4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40 percent} of the number of molecular substructures M and the number of side effects L, respectively. In addition, we empirically set N′=10 and ρ=105. We find that DGDFS achieves the best results when M¯=16%M, L¯=20%L, α=0.7, β=5, γ=100, and μ=0.5. Detailed analysis of parameter settings will be presented in the later subsection. In our experiments, we find that the objective function of DGDFS is non-increasing with the increase of the number of iterations. Due to space limitation, we do not present the results of convergence study in this section.

5.4 Experimental Results
The mean and standard deviation (STD) values of comparison methods in terms of seven metrics and running time are presented in Table 1. It can be seen that the metric values output by DGDFS are higher than those by other methods in most cases, which demonstrates the great performance of DGDFS in ADDI prediction. By comparing DGDFS with ADDI prediction models in terms of AUC, we observe that DGDFS outperforms LSSM by 40.5 percent, LPSE by 17.1 percent, MDRM by 19.4 percent, and DLM by 9.5 percent. The reason lies on that these four methods only adopt one drug attribute for ADDI prediction, which cannot well model the adverse interaction among drugs. It can be seen that the AUC value provided by DGDFS is still higher than those by AMFP, ADFN, MLMS and MSLS, although these four methods integrate multiple attributes for ADDI prediction. The primary reason for these results is that AMFP, ADFN, MLMS, and MSLS treat each feature without discrimination and equally employ all features for training, while DGDFS is designed based on discriminative feature selection, which is capable of selecting privileged molecular substructures and significant side effects for ADDI prediction. By comparing DGDFS with feature selection models, we observe that DGDFS outputs the highest metrics in most cases. On the one hand, the proposed model is free of projection by adopting l2,0-norm equality constraints, which can directly select the number of features in the optimization process. On the other hand, DGDFS not only enhances the dependence between drug attributes and ADDI, but also strengths the dependence between molecular structure and side effect. These two reasons may account for its superior performance over the compared feature selection methods. When we compare DGDFS with its variants, it can be seen that the average improvements of DGDFS over DGDFS-D, DGDFS-R, and DGDFS-S in terms of AUC are 8.7, 3.7, and 3.1 percent, respectively, which indicates that the dependence between molecular structure and side effect, the self-representation of drug attributes, and the preservation of critical drug information can enhance ADDI prediction. Besides, as we can see, the values of Specificity, Accuracy, and Precision output by all methods are higher than 0.7 and the values of F-score are lower than 0.6. Meanwhile, we find that the differences for these four metrics are not very significant among the comparison methods. The reason for these results is that there exists an imbalance between the number of ADDIs and non-ADDIs, leading to TN>TP≈FN>FP output by the methods in most cases, which results in high values of Specificity, Accuracy, and Precision and relatively low values of F-score as well as little differences for these four metrics among the comparison methods. In addition, the value of F-score output by NDFS is higher than that output by DGDFS, since the nonnegative and orthogonal constraints are imposed on the objective function of NDFS. Moreover, we note that MSLS requires the least running time among the comparison methods. The reason is that MSLS owns less number of parameters than other methods, which enhances its efficiency in ADDI prediction.

Table 1- 
Experimental Results (Mean$\pm$±STD) of Comparison Methods in Terms of Seven Metrics and Running Time (s) for ADDI Prediction
To further verify the effectiveness of DGDFS, we conduct additional experiments by first sampling {50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90 percent} of ADDIs and adopting their attributes for training, and then utilizing the trained model to predict the remaining ADDIs. The results of comparison algorithms with different training sets are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen from Fig. 4a, 4b, 4c, and 4f that the increase of training sets leads to the increase of Specificity, Accuracy, Precision, and AUC. However, the values of Recall, F-score, and AUPR do not increase along with the increase of training sets, as shown in Figs. 4d, 4e, and 4g. Due to that the number of ADDIs is less than the number of non-ADDIs, all methods are more inclined to learn non-ADDIs than ADDIs and it is difficult for them to predict 1s than 0s in sparse matrix R. Based on these facts, it can be inferred that ADDIs can be easily mispredicted as non-ADDIs and the values of FN are more sensitive to the increase of training sets than TP, FP, and TN. These reasons result in the fluctuations of the curves in Fig. 4d, 4e, and 4g. From the results in Fig. 4, we can conclude that the performance of DGDFS is superior over other methods in most cases.

Show All

In addition, to investigate the effectiveness of DGDFS in selecting discriminative features for ADDI prediction, we compare it with feature selection models by varying the number of selected molecular substructures M¯ and the number of selected side effects L¯, as shown in Figs. 5 and 6. Here, we only present the results of Accuracy, F-score, AUC, and AUPR, as the curves in terms of Specificity and Precision are similar to those of Accuracy, and the curves in terms of Recall are similar to those of F-score. In particular, we observe that the AUC curves provided by DGDFS are markedly better than those output by the compared feature selection models, as shown in Figs. 5c and 6c. The main reason for these results may be similar to the results presented in Table 1. As we can see, DGDFS also yields higher results in terms of Accuracy, F-score, and AUPR in most cases. It can be observed that the metric values output by DGDFS reach the best when M¯=16%M and L¯=20%L, which indicates that ADDIs are essentially caused by 16 percent most discriminative molecular substructures and 20 percent most discriminative side effects. It also can be concluded from Figs. 5 and 6 that DGDFS tends to achieve better results with fewer selected molecular substructures and side effects.

5.5 Sparsity Analysis for Matrix W
In this subsection, we aim to analyze the effects of the column sparsity of matrix W on the performance of DGDFS. Figs. 7a to 7d show the results of the column sparsity of matrix W in terms of Accuracy, F-score, AUC, and AUPR. As we can see, the higher the parameter γ leads to the better the column sparsity of W, but does not result in higher values of the metrics, which indicates that there is a balance between the column sparsity of matrix W and the performance of DGDFS. When γ=100, DGDFS outputs the best results and the column sparsity of matrix W is 0.891 (i.e., the l2-norms of 89.1 percent columns in matrix W are close to 0). The visualization of the l1,2-norm of matrix W is presented in Fig. 7e. Each column in Fig. 7e represents the l2-norm of each column in matrix W. The deeper the blue, the closer of the l2-norm of a column to 0. These results indicate that the matrix W output by DGDFS owns good column sparsity.

5.6 Parameter Analysis
DGDFS contains three regularization parameters α, β, and γ. Based on the grid search strategy, we investigate the effects of each parameter by fixing the others to analyze its impacts on prediction results. Fig. 8 shows the results of parameters α, β, and γ in terms of Accuracy, F-score, AUC, and AUPR. It can be seen that F-score is more sensitive to the variations of α, β, and γ than Accuracy, AUC, and AUPR. When α is fixed, the variations of β and γ have almost no impact on AUPR. In addition, we observe that the values of these metrics are relatively low in cases of α=1, β=0, and γ=0. These results also indicate the effectiveness of the dependence between molecular structure and side effect and the self-representation of drug attributes in ADDI prediction. From the curves, we can observe that DGDFS outputs the best results when α=0.7. β=5 and γ=100.

5.7 Case Study
The main advantage of DGDFS over comparison methods is its capability in selecting discriminative molecular substructures and side effects for ADDI prediction. This discriminative feature information can provide valuable suggestions for drug safety professors to detect potential ADDIs and reduce research expenditures for drug developments.

In this subsection, we conduct a case study of three examples for presenting the discriminative molecular substructures and side effects explored by DGDFS, as shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9a presents the adverse interaction between Atropine and Prednisolone [59]. The discriminative molecular substructures for Atropine and Prednisolone are covered by green and orange, respectively, which may result in haemolytic anaemia. In addition, the discriminative side effects respiratory failure and myatrophy caused by Atropine and Prednisolone will increase the risks of asphyxia coma when they are co-administrated. In terms of Bisoprolol and Diltiazem shown in Fig. 9b, their discriminative molecular substructures are covered by blue and pink, respectively, which may lead to hypotension. Both Bisoprolol and Diltiazem own the side effects of erythra and bradycardia. The interaction between them will amplify their respective side effects and lead to pruritus and atrioventricular block [53]. As for the interaction between Aspirin and Warfarin shown in Fig. 9c, the discriminative substructures for these two drugs may lead to gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which also results from the side effects gastrointestinal discomfort and ecchymosis caused by Aspirin and Warfarin, respectively [5].

SECTION 6Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a discriminative feature selection model DGDFS for ADDI prediction. The proposed model adopts two drug attributes, molecular structure and side effect to model the adverse interaction among drugs and uses l2,0-norm equality constraints to select discriminative molecular substructures and side effects as well as designs three dependence guided terms to enhance feature selection and guide ADDI prediction. Based on the ADMM method, an iterative algorithm is designed for efficient optimization of DGDFS. Experimental results on the real-world dataset show the effectiveness of DGDFS in ADDI prediction when compared with fourteen baselines and its three variants.

There are still some problems to be solved in the future. First, we find that DGDFS does not perform well in terms of Recall, F-score, and AUPR. To this end, we aim to investigate the intrinsic properties (e.g., nonnegativeness, orthogonality, and positive definiteness, etc.) of the selected feature spaces so as to improve its prediction results. Second, we will validate the selected molecular substructures and side effects with the help of drug safety experts for better evaluating the effectiveness of DGDFS model. Third, ADDIs are not only caused by molecular structure and side effect, but also affected by many other attributes, including target, enzyme, pathway, and disease, etc. In the future, more attributes will be taken into consideration for more accurate ADDI modeling. Furthermore, as deep learning based methods also achieve considerable prediction results [24], [25], [40], we aim to design a deep attributed embedding learning model with the incorporation of convolutional neural network for capturing attribute embeddings of drugs and modeling their non-linearity in ADDI prediction. In addition, this work only pays attention to whether adverse interaction would happen or not for a drug pair. In fact, there are multiple types of adverse interactions associated with a particular drug pair [3]. Exploring the detailed types of ADDIs is also the focus of our future researches.
