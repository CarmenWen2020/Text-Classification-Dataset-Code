1. Introduction
There is a huge technological revolution in a few decades from first-generation (1G) technology with data rate in Kbps to fifth-generation (5G) technology with data rate in Gbps. Technology use cases have varied from simple voice communication to interactive multimedia applications. With the introduction of interactive multi-media applications, there is a huge increase in terms of customers demanding connectivity and resources. Connecting devices to the cellular network are expected to reach almost 50 billion by end of 2020 (More than 50 billion conn, 2011). To fulfil the user’s high data rate demand, technology has made a shift towards 5G era. Key goals of 5G include:

•
More number of connected devices(10–100 X)

•
high data rate(10–100X)

•
High data volume(1000X)

•
low latency(less than 1 ms)

•
Availability and reliability of Network (99.99)

5G is not just the improved version of fourth-generation (4G) technology but it’s an entirely new era of wireless communication. Different technologies being used to achieve goals of 5G include cell densification, millimetre wave (mm-Wave) communication, massive MIMO (M-MIMO). Cell densification means adding more cells (micro, picocell, femtocell, nano, relay and WI-Fi access points) into traditional large size, the high powered macro base station (BS) wireless communication network. The key idea is to enhance the capacity of the network by reusing the spectrum again and again and minimizing the latency by bringing the end-user closer to network. Macrocells are for outdoor coverage, micro and pico for both indoor and outdoor and Femto for indoor coverage. Macrocells have the highest power among them and femtocell has the lowest one. The biggest challenge is the interference handling in dense cell deployment method (Hickey, 2018).

As multimedia applications, on-line gaming and several other high data rates demanding applications coming into the scene, the available spectrum resource is becoming scarce day by day. The need of the hour is to utilize new spectrum avenues (30–300 GHz). There is huge (250 GHz) spectrum is available to satisfy user demands. However, propagation characteristics (attenuation, diffraction, atmospheric losses) of this mm-Wave range spectrum are much different as compared to the microwave range. The smaller wavelength of mm-Wave enable the greater use of spatial diversity because of multiple small size antennas can be deployed over small area (Bogale et al., 2017). M-MIMO uses spatial diversity to enhance the spectrum utilization efficiency by transmitting and receiving multiple data signals belonging to different users over the same radio resource. In M-MIMO same frequency band is utilized over spatially distributed sites so Intercell interference management is a key concern of M-MIMO implemented system. Currently, 2–4 antennas are used in regular MIMO networks. However, M-MIMO is a breakthrough technology for 5G and beyond communication with 96–128 antennas being utilized in MIMO action (Mundy and Thomas).

Each technology (cell densification, mm-Wave, M-MIMO) have serious limitations along with several benefits. In cell densification, interference management becomes a crucial one that arises when Base stations are transmitting at the same frequency band. Both Co-tier interference and cross-tier interference need to be handled. Cell densification provides high spectral efficiency at cost of high power utilization. So, maintaining energy efficiency becomes a challenging task along with spectral efficiency. Efficient handover and mobility management is also a key challenging task of densely deployed cellular network (Meera and Sadashivappa, 2019). Hardware manufacturing for transmitting and receiving sides, greater transmission losses and short-range LOS (line of sight) communication are serious limitations of mmWave communication method(Nutaq) (Nutaq).

Serious limitations of 5G technology and continuous evolvement of high data rate interactive multimedia applications live audio, video streaming, online gaming requires and IoT(internet of things) emergence require the development of new technological avenues for increasing data rate and spectral efficiency with minimized involved cost for 5G and beyond 5G technologies. UAV (Unmanned Aerial vehicle) assisted heterogeneous networks (Het-Nets) are the most cost-effective solution to handle scenarios like sudden communication infrastructure failure due to natural disaster, communication equipment malfunctioning or a sudden increase in no of users demanding connectivity and high data rate. Fig. 1 shows UAV Assisted 5G network. UAV are mobile stations that can fly to any area without human pilot intervention. Initially, they were launched for military applications but later on, due to low cost, LoS communication, manoeuvrability, adaptive communication and several other useful features made it an important breakthrough technology in civilian uses like cargo delivery, wireless communication, search and rescue, precision agriculture etc (ZHANG). The biggest use of UAV in future is its application for 5G and beyond 5G wireless communication.From year 2000 researchers are trying to incorporate UAV’s in to existing cellular infrastructure. First prototype was GPRS operated network between two UAV’s and existing ground operator. Several proposals to use UAV with existing LTE networks were presented in third generation partnership project(3GPP) (Sharma et al., 2020). In wireless communication UAV have three use cases:

1.
As mobile BS that can be deployed at any hard to reach or high capacity demanding or any other areas where there is infrastructure failure.

2.
As flying Relay node with single UAV or multiple UAV’s either in store and forward (SF) or decode and forward (DF) modes to provide connectivity between distantly located source-destination pair.

3.
As Flying user equipment (UE) that can used for any delivery services or for information collection as remote sensing nodes in hard to reach areas (ZHANG).

Fig. 1

Despite several benefits of UAV assisted wireless communication, there are several challenges which need to be addressed to make an efficient communication environment. Accurate Air to ground channel modelling is required in UAV assisted communication. As both BS and user are mobile as compared to terrestrial communication in which the only user is mobile so channel modelling becomes a complicated task UAV communication environment (Zheng et al., 2013a). UAV BS placement is 3D placement problem as compared to terrestrial BS placement that is a 2D placement scenario. UAV BS placement needs to consider the geographical details, location of the user, channel characteristics details of air to ground link, battery and time constraint of hovering UAV etc. Also in case of multiple UAV deployment interferences among UAV’s must be considered while 3D deployment strategy designing (Santhi et al., 2003a; Rajiv, 2018). Trajectory planning is a challenging task for UAV assisted communication as an optimal trajectory finding to involve finding infinite no of optimization variable (position of UAV). Trajectory planning must consider several other parameters like energy and flight constraint of UAV, user demands, collision avoidance among UAVs etc. As UAV’s assisted communication networks coexist with the traditional terrestrial wireless communication network. So, resources like spectrum are shared among them. Also, the unique features of UAV like manoeuvrability, limited time and energy constraint etc makes the resource management in UAV assisted communication a complicated task. UAV’s are usually battery operated that is a limited resource and UAV’s battery utilization directly defines the UAV operation lifetime. So to prolong the UAV life time-efficient energy utilization is an important challenge in UAV assisted communication (Agyapong et al., 2014a; Halonen et al., 2003). Backhaul connectivity is a major design consideration in any communication network. Due to the flying nature of UAV wireless backhauling is required. Promising candidates for wireless backhauling involve satellite link, Wi-Fi, mm-Wave and FSO(free-space optical network) (Santhi et al., 2003b; Sesia et al., 2009). Interference management in multi UAV deployment is another major challenging task. UAV placement directly defines the covered users and QoS(quality of service) criteria for UAV. Placement is a challenging task as it is a 3D placement problem unlike 2D in traditional wireless communication networks. UAV placement problem is divided into two horizontal and vertical placement. Altitude and elevation angle has a direct impact on coverage area and communication quality. Due to mobile nature of UAV maintaining the communication link quality between Tx and Rx is a continuous optimization problem by finding the infinite no of optimized values for placement variables unlike traditional wireless communication where the only user is mobile and BS is fixed and location of user defines the link quality. In UAV assisted wireless communication resources are shared between conventional ground wireless communication networks and UAVs. Efficient resource allocation schemes must be designed to achieve an optimized network in terms of throughput and covered users. UAV’s are usually battery operated and have limited onboard energy. UAV’s lifetime is battery dependent. So to prolong the UAV assisted communication network life time-efficient energy utilization is the key concern. Bandwidth, user association, power and time slot allocations are other key factors in resources management which need to be addressed.

This article is organized as follows: In section 2 it discusses the brief history of wireless communication from 1G to 5G followed by key requirements, enabling technologies and techniques for 5 G and beyond wireless communication. UAV incorporation in wireless communication, its use cases (as aerial BS, Relay node and UE), network architecture and open challenges for using UAV in wireless communication is presented in section 3.

Future research directions are listed in section 6. Survey paper flow/summary is given in Fig. 2.

2. 5G and beyond 5G wireless networks
The major force behind continuous wireless technology evolution is the increasing number of people requiring high data rates on more and more devices. Mobile data traffic is likely to rise sevenfold in just five years from 2016 to 2021. However, due to the limited available spectrum for mobile communications, it is getting overcrowded day by day. Already available networks (e.g., 2G, 3G, and 4G) cannot always satisfy user required data rate and connectivity, particularly during times of high demand (e.g., match, emergency). During times of high demand, users may suffer due to slow connectivity, low data rates, delays, or complete loss of service. So, there is a huge demand for constant advancement in the field of wireless technology for the continuous betterment of communication experience (Rajiv, 2018; Agyapong et al., 2014a).

2.1. History (1G - 5G)
The journey of wireless communication from radio, television and satellite to today’s smart mobile phones has enabled the lifestyle of individuals in society. Fig. 3 shows the evolution of wireless communication. The progress in the wireless domain is shown below by each generation roll-out:

1.
1G In first-generation (1G) technologies, first mobile phone was presented to consumers. Networks were analogue and only voice services (No data service) was provided to users. It was expensive technology at that time. Only limited coverage and capacity was offered to end users by 1G technology(Santhi et al., 2003a).

2.
2G Digital network was introduced in Second-generation (2G) technologies. Both voice and texting services were offered to end-users. Coverage was improved, affordability was increased by decreasing the phone prices (Rajiv, 2018; Halonen et al., 2003; Santhi et al., 2003b).

3.
3G Third-generation (3G) technologies offered both voice and data. Breakthrough advancement of 3G was Internet facility on a mobile phone. People can check email or watch video on mobile phones (Halonen et al., 2003). Smartphones were launched and users started using mobile phones as an alternate of computers for business and entertainment purposes. This resulted in a sudden increase in data rate demand.

4.
4G Fourth-generation (4G) technologies have introduced mobile broadband in true sense with higher data rates that could be used for music and live video streaming, mobile data applications, online gaming and many more. Different data plans are offered and a variety of mobile devices are introduced in 4G to connect other devices to the network (Mshvidobadze, 2012). For each mobile generation certain specifics performance levels were achieved (e.g. speed, capacity, connectivity and added features).

Fig. 3

Fig. 3. Evolution of wireless communication (1G to 5G).

To be addressed as a “3G network” a certain specific network architecture and particular technologies were utilized, definite levels of speeds were offered and new features were provided. In starting mobile generations, companies and countries opted for different standards to ensure a certain level of performance requirements(Andrews et al., 2007) (Sesia et al., 2009). In later generations (3G and 4G), companies and countries opted for networks that were based on the same standards. So, due to the same standards, the same equipment could be used in different countries, resulting in economies of scale, and speedy deployment (Agyapong et al., 2014b). For example, for fourth-generation, Long-Term Evolution (LTE) standards were used by different countries and it brought a revolution in wireless technology in terms of data rate and capacity (Rajiv, 2018; Agyapong et al., 2014a).

5.
5G As the number of devices using data is increasing on a very fast pace, so new standards are required to satisfy large data, fast and reliable connectivity demands. Fifth-generation (5G) networks are the solution. New technologies were introduced in 5G network to achieve certain specific required performance levels. Figure no 3 shows the comparison of different mobile generations (Rajiv, 2018).

2.2. 5G key requirements and technologies
Fig. 4 displays key requirements of 5G. Widely accepted 5G requirements include high data date, low latency, more number of connected devices, better battery lifetime and very high traffic volume (Halonen et al., 2003). 5G is not just a modified version of 4G but it is a complete revelatory change at every network layer. Several new technological concepts have been introduced to satisfy the cutting edge requirements of 5G and beyond technologies. Some of 5G key requirements and technologies are given below:

1.
Densification With ever-increasing traffic and data rate demands of users, there is an immense need for technological measures to enhance the capacity of the network. Densification is adding more and more cell sites to already existing infrastructure to enhance the network capacity. Heterogeneous network architectures are introduced in which Macro, Micro, Pico, Femtocells are simultaneously deployed (Khan et al., 2020; Alaei and Yazdanpanah, 2019; Khanet al., 2020a; Zhang et al., 2013; Khanet al., 2020b).

2.
M-MIMO M-MIMO uses spatial multiplexing concept to enhance the network capacity. It deploys hundreds of antennas on single Macro BS all of them are spatially distributed whereas user has only a single antenna (Larsson et al., 2014; Jamilet al., 2015). It utilizes beamforming technology. Due to directional beams, they are very useful for High-frequency communication. As in M-MIMO BS transmit directional beam on the same radio channel so it enhanced the capacity to many folds without the need of extra spectrum(Nam et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2014).

3.
mm Wave With 5G and beyond there is the ever-increasing number of users demanding connectivity and high data rate. Due to cutting edge demands from the end-users existing spectrum is getting crowded day by day. Researches are exploiting new mm-Wave band (30–300 GHz) (Boccardi et al., 2014a). Due to high propagation losses of mm-Wave as compared to microwave frequency line of the site communication link is used for mm-Wave communication (Niu et al., 2015). However, the small size of the antenna allows a large number of mm-Wave operated antenna on single tower (Rappaport et al., 2013).

4.
Network Function Virtualization NFV decreases network load by performing network tasks on software-controlled remote servers whereas in normal networks these actions are performed by dedicated servers (Han et al., 2015).

5.
Self-Interference Cancellation Full Duplex communication scenario not only gets the interference from neighbouring radio channel but by itself as well (Han et al., 2014). Which is called self-interference. Researchers have designed different SIC techniques to enhance the network throughput (Zhang et al., 2015).

6.
Software Defined Networking SDN network separates the control functions and data forwarding functions of the network. Network control functions are handled by software-controlled servers (Kim and Feamster, 2013; Farhadi et al., 2015). However, applications are managed by network infrastructure. So it reduced the overall network load.

7.
Caching The cache is a temporary and rapidly accessible storage area where data is stored for later on use instead of approaching slow network memory. It greatly improves data retrieval rate of the system by reducing the network burden (Wang et al., 2014; Boccardi et al., 2014b).

8.
Device To Device D2D communication means direct communication between network devices if they are nearby. In normal networks communication via BS occur. However, as BS has to accommodate several user’s demands. So, each one is provided little data rate as compared to D2D connection (Madueño et al., 2014; Ratasuk et al., 2015; Khan et al., 2021). As in D2D direct communication link is present between two network entities so it greatly enhances throughput reliability and latency problem. Despite numerous benefits of D2D communication mode several challenges (efficient algorithms, transmission management etc.) need to be addressed. These D2D networks have several applications in health monitoring, safety and security etc. (Fan et al., 2014).

9.
Full Duplex Conventional wireless communication is half-duplex which means that transmission and reception occur in different time slots. However, in 5G and beyond technology has introduced the new concept of full duplexing. In Full duplexing concurrent transmission and reception occur in the same time slot. Resulting in 2 times spectral efficiency. The biggest challenge for full-duplex communication is self-interference between a transmitted and received signal. So, full-duplex systems have to implement SIC techniques(Zhang et al., 2016).

10.
Visual Light Communication In 5G and beyond communication un-regulated Visual light band is a great source of high data rate, short-range, LoS communication with help of light-emitting diodes in optical links. LoS makes it very secure and energy-efficient. However, several issues related to VLC need to be addressed (Grobe et al., 2013; Jovicic et al., 2013).

11.
Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Techniques In NOMA, no of users can utilize the similar frequency bandwidth whereas they are differentiated by the power value that is allocated to them respectively (Liu et al., 2019a; Sun et al., 2019a).

12.
Aerial Base Stations UAV or drone is a kind of flying machine that works without a human pilot involvement that can be controlled from the ground. Technological advancement has resulted in considerable growth in the field of UAVs. Just in a few decades, various types of UAV’s have been developed that can be used for many military and commercial purposes as well. Initially, UAV’s were designed and developed for military use only e.g. as a spy during wartime. However, recent development has to lead the UAV’s to public markets as well. The most important application of UAV is serving as temporary flying BS in 5G and beyond 5G communication(Zeng et al., 2016a).

2.3. 5G channel modeling
Era is moving from conventional communication to 5th generation communication services which require high data rate, low end to end latencies, higher no of connected devices, more reliability. One way is to move to higher frequency ranges towards mm wave ranges above 6 GHz, towards 100 GHz. Different regions are exploiting different frequency ranges for example in China and Europe 26 GHz, in Japan 28 GHz and 70 GHz band is under consideration in US and Korea (Hoppe et al., 2017). Researchers are working on new technologies like advanced multiple access techniques, massive MIMO, device to device communication and many others in order to satisfy cutting edge requirements of 5G communication. Channel propagation characteristics are the major limiting factor in order to achieve the communication characteristics. Predictions are required for interference calculation, coverage planning and determination of multi path effects. 5G communication channel must support extra 5G Channel modeling needs along with the needs of conventional communication methods of 3G and 4G and it must be able to support new techniques like massive MIMO, large antenna arrays, device to device communication.Its computational complexity must be within practical levels. Existing wave propagation models for conventional communication methods operating at low frequency ranges are not implementable at higher frequencies as well (Eggers et al., 2019). So, detailed realistic wave propagation models operating at 5G bands are required in order to accurately estimate the performance of future 5G communication network. Wide range of possible scenarios exist from ruler to urban areas, indoor office to large buildings, stadiums, highways, tunnels etc. 5G Wave propagation models to address all those vast variety of scenarios are required (Bhardwaj et al., 2018).

Different aspects that must be considered for 5G channel modeling are presented in (Agiwal et al., 2016) and are summarized below:

•
Penetration

•
Attenuation

•
Free space Path loss

•
Fading

•
RMS Delay Spread

•
Power Delay profile

•
Shadowing

•
Multi path propagation

•
Channel Impulse response

Several researchers are focusing these days on 5G channel modeling. The work in (Hoppe et al., 2017) has extended the ray-optical wave propagation models in the Win-Prop to account for possible 5G frequency bands.it has considered all prominent radio propagation phenomena’s (reflection, diffraction, scattering).it has analyzed path loss and beam diversity at 2.9,28 GHz and 73 GHz beam diversity analysis at 28 GHz results that second strongest path is 7 dB weaker still enough to maintain the connection (Eggers et al., 2019). have focused on wireless channel modeling for ultra-reliable communication (10−9 error rate)which is one of the main requirement of 5G communication. Simple power law expression is used to show channel characteristics in ultra-reliable environment. It has provided a unified framework for modeling and valuation of all practically substantial models operating in ultra-reliable environment. Overview of 5G channel models and propagation characteristics is given in (Bhardwaj et al., 2018). It has discussed different state of the art 5G channel modeling methods and channel requirements as well. 5G channel model for small scale fading characteristic is proposed in (Wu et al., 2018). It is non-stationary channel model based on WINNER II and Saleh-Valenzuela. The proposed channel model contains the capability to adapt to various scenarios in a well fitted way (Liu et al., 2019b). has presented non-stationary both theoretical and simulation channel models for high speed train communication environment in presence of mm-wave and massive MIMO technologies. Result indicate high correlation between statistical properties of theoretical and simulation model.

3. UAV incorporated in wireless networks
UAV or drone is a kind of flying machine that works without a human pilot involvement and can be controlled from the ground. Technological advancement has resulted in considerable growth in the field of UAVs. Just in a few decades, various types of UAV’s have been developed that can be used for many military and commercial purposes as well. Initially, UAV’s were designed and developed for military use only e.g. as a spy during wartime. However, recent development has to lead the UAV’s to public markets as well.

The most important application of UAV is serving as temporary flying BS in 5G and beyond 5G communication. In the last few decades, there is a tremendous increase in UAV’s enabled applications. However, its application in the field of high speed demanding wireless communication (5G and beyond 5G) has resulted in a revolutionary step in the field of wireless communication. The main advantage of UAV assisted wireless communication is that it is the most favourable method to provide wireless coverage and connectivity to the end-users who have no infrastructure coverage due to below reasons:

1.
Severe shadowing, mountainous terrain or urban areas.

2.
Damaged communication infrastructure because of natural disasters.

3.1. UAV types
Depending upon altitude either they are low altitude or high altitude UAVs and given below:

1.
Low altitude platform (LAP) are easy to install and has fast and flexible deployment as compared to high altitude platform but they have shorter coverage area and small endurance time.

2.
High altitude platform (HAP) can serve the mission for several months but they involve large deployment cost as compared to LAP. So LAP is more cost-effective.

Depending upon wing type UAV can be either fixed-wing or rotatory wing and given below:

1.
Fixed wing generates lift using wings with forwarding airspeed. It needs a runway for taking off and landing, forward speed need to be maintained. Its characteristics are simple structure, high speed and higher payload.

2.
Rotary wing generates lift using blades revolving around a rotor shaft. It can hover and move in any direction. Its mechanism is based on vertical takeoff and landing. Its characteristics are Usually lower payload, lower speed and shorter-range (ZHANG; Zhang, 2018).

3.2. UAV use cases in wireless communication
UAVs have a great utilization in today’s rapidly changing world. There are several perspective scenarios in which UAV can serve the purpose. They can be deployed as flying BS where in case of some disaster situation or if there is huge traffic load flying BS can accommodate all those users in failure or complete absence of infrastructure due to some disaster situation. Another major UAV application is using UAV as flying UE(user equipment) e.g delivery services or surveillance purposes etc. UAV use cases are shown in Fig. 6. If drones are used as flying UE then new technical challenges and avenues need to be addressed as ground UE is much different as compared to flying UE (More than 50 billion conn, 2011). Some of the challenges include:

1.
Different channel conditions between aerial UE and ground BS as compared to the channel condition that is faced by ground UE.

2.
Energy constraint of the drone as they are usually battery operated

3.
Mobility management of drone UE as they are continuously flying stations.

Fig. 6

Fig. 6. UAV use cases.

UAVs can also be used as a flying relay network or flying Ad-hoc network. This has a great impact in enhancing connectivity and geographical communication range in hard to reach areas (Zafar and Khan, 2016a).

•
As we are living in an era where there is a huge technological revolution. With the introduction of interactive multimedia applications, no of users demanding connectivity and coverage is continuously increasing. So there is a great need for the development of new methods to enhance the network capacity. Several methods like M-MIMO, heterogeneous cellular network, mm-Wave communication, orthogonal multiple access schemes(Agyapong et al., 2014c) have been developed to satisfy users enhanced data rate and connectivity demands. But all of them have their limitations. UAV assisted BS is a new advancement in order to satisfy user demands as it is a very cost-effective and fast approach to satisfy connectivity in hard to reach areas or in any case if there are a large number of users e.g in case of cricket match all the users are continuously uploading and receiving data. UAV assisted BS can be deployed in such scenarios to enhance capacity and coverage constraint of 5G and beyond networks(Zeng et al., 2016b). The biggest advantage of UAV assisted BS is that it is the fastest most cost-effective method to satisfy the on-demand service requirement of end-users (Bucaille, 2013, Lyu et al., 2018).

•
In case of some natural disaster flood, hurricane, earthquake etc wireless communication system is affected due to partial or complete infrastructure failure. There remain no communication means. Some kind of communication method is immediately required in such a scenario for search and rescue operation to save the lives and for restarting the connectivity. To address the public safety matter several high speed dedicated broadband networks were established e.g: First Net, TETRA, APCO25 (Baldini et al., 2014). However UAV based aerial BS is a more suitable candidate for disaster management due to its high mobility, fast deployment, low-cost factor (Merwaday and Guvenc, 2015).

•
As spectrum is becoming a scarce resource so communication systems are shifting to higher frequency range such as mmWave. But high frequency has high propagation losses. So there is a need for some kind of communication method that causes minimum propagation loss. UAV’s have greater chances of LoS communication link so they are the most suitable candidate for mm-Wave communication applications. Also, UAV’s offers little propagation loss due to LoS communication which is the key requirement for mmWave communication. (ZHANG) (Zhanget al., 2019).

•
M-MIMO and 3D MIMO are deployed to maximize the network capacity by reducing the interference among users with help of spatial diversity factor (Namet al., 2013). 3D MIMO exploits both horizontal and vertical dimensions to generate beams with help of multiple antennae in directions that are physically far apart. That results in low interference factor. This helps in satisfying the QoS requirement of large no of users. UAV enabled BS are the most suitable candidate for 3D MIMO systems because they offer LoS communication that is the key requirement for beamforming (Mozaffari et al., 2019b).

2.
Aerial User Equipment

•
Nowadays UAV’s are utilized for capturing scenes that were previously possible only with the help of expensive supporting equipment e.g helicopters and high cranes. Cinematography and sports photography have been greatly advanced for filming action and sci-fi scenes with help of UAVs. Furthermore, nowadays UAV’s have a very major contribution in live coverage scenes.

•
Amazon, UPS, and DHL kind of bib names in delivery services are considering the option of UAV assisted delivery. This will result in manpower saving and road traffic shifting to the sky. They can assist in delivering small packages, food, letters, medicines, beverages to smaller distances.

•
UAV’s can be used for capturing high-resolution information in hard to reach areas e.g islands, mountains and coastlines. They can also be utilized in 3D and source mapping applications.

•
UAV’s provide rescue operation in a natural or man-made disaster, to collect data of victims with high definition cameras, sensors, and radars in a disaster scene. Due to the small size of UAV’s they are able to capture close up view of a disaster area where large vehicles are not used fully because of their large size.

•
Farmers need cost-effective methods to regularly monitor their farms. The infrared sensors incorporated in UAV’s can be used for crop health monitoring enabling farmers to take measures for crop health improvement by using fertilizer or insecticides. It also improves a better yield of the crops.

•
Due to night vision because of thermal sensors UAV’s are a strong candidate for surveillance applications. UAV’s can identify the location of lost persons and victims and can help them by the provision of useful items in terrain situation.

•
UAV’s can be used in weather monitoring and forecast and can even be sent in harsh conditions for forecast purposes e.g in hurricanes and tornadoes areas to avoid any further mishaps.

•
Drones have served as a deterrent to poachers. UAV’s can provide an exceptional guard to animals that are favourite hunter’s target and are rare species. Due to thermal cameras and sensors, they can also operate at night time. This assists them to observe their behaviour and life patterns without any interference in their habitat.

•
UAV’s can be used to monitor large crowd to ensure public safety and avoid any mishap. They assist in monitoring criminal and illegal activities. In fact, fire investigations, smugglers of migrants, and illegal transportation of drugs via coastlines are monitored by the border patrol with the help of UAVs.

•
Drones can be used in the entertainment industry for example cage matches. Two contenders and their drones are put up against each other. The destruction of any of the player’s drones results in the other’s win.

3.
UAV as Relay Network UAVs can create their own network by communicating with one another without a central control just like a flying ad-hoc network (Zafar and Khan, 2016b). These relay network act as a reliable communication mean for hard to reach areas due to any obstacles or any disastrous situation. These UAV relay networks greatly enhance the communication range of the network towards distant target areas which are otherwise impossible to reach. These remotely deputed UAV relay nodes gather the information and transmit to a near-by BS. As UAV communication require LoS path so in presence of obstacles multiple UAV’s are used to achieve the LoS targeted communication (Doherty, 2014).UAV Relay network can be used in various fields e.g: border surveillance, disastrous area surveillance, Remote sensing, forest fire monitoring etc.

3.3. UAV network architecture
Two basic categories of communication links are used in UAV assisted wireless communication. Fig. 7 shows UAV control diagram.

Control and non-payload (CNPC) links are necessary for all UAVs to control the whole communication operation between UAVs and end-users. They are used for secure information transfer on UAV to UAV link, UAV to ground control station link. There also exist autonomous UAVs. They can complete their missions with help of onboard computers and do not require human control to accomplish their task. But CNPC links are also established for autonomous systems as well to deal with emergency situations. Another kind of control links called air traffic control (ATC) links are also involved in UAV aided mission if UAVs are within range of some controlled airspace. The frequency band used for CNPC links are L-band and C-band that are (960–977 MHz) and (5030–5091 MHz), respectively (Zeng et al., 2016d).

Furthermore, two types of CNPC links exist and given below:

•
Primary CNPC The direct link between the ground control station and UAV is called primary CNPC link. They offer less delay so, always preferred.

•
Secondary CNPC There also exist secondary CNPC links via some high altitude platform. They offer more delay but preferred for reliability and robustness of link (Zeng et al., 2016d; Matolak and Sun, 2015).

2.
Data Link The data links support communications for the ground terminals, which may include terrestrial BS, gateways, UE (mobile terminal) etc. Datalink capacity varies from few kbps in UAV-Sensor path to Gbps in wireless backhauls. They have relaxed latency and security demand as compared to CNPC links. Frequency band (LTE) already engaged in some application can be reused or dedicated spectrum (mm-Wave) allocation can be made for data links (ZHANG). UAV data links can be used for the following communication types:

•
Mobile-UAV communication in case of BS offloading or complete malfunction of BS.

•
UAV-BS and UAV-gateway wireless backhaul.

•
UAV-UAV wireless backhaul (Zeng et al., 2016d).

3.4. UAV implementation challenges
UAVs are becoming a crucial part of next-generation wireless networks (5G and beyond). There are tremendous growth and research work in this area. Despite several advantages of UAVs in wireless communication, there are several challenges which need to be addressed in order to achieve efficient utilization of UAVs. Fig. 8 shows UAV implementation challenges. These challenges are discussed below:

1.
3D placement of UAV base station UAV Placement is one of the biggest challenges. As in UAV, assisted communication BS placement need to be addressed in a 3D plane where the altitude is key design consideration as compared to Terrestrial communication where BS placement is only in a 2D plane. Mobile base satiation placement depends upon several factors which include: The location of a user, air to ground channel characteristics, geographical area details, energy and battery constraints of UAV and flight time constraint. Also if more than one UAV’s are going to be deployed then placement should be done considering the interference among UAV’s as well (Kalantari et al., 2016; Košmerl and Vilhar, 2014).

2.
Resource Management Resource management in UAV assisted wireless communication network is an important challenging task which needs to be addressed as resources are shared between UAVs and existing ground terrestrial communication network. Also UAVs unique features like energy and time constraint, path planning, interference form air to ground and air to air links, manoeuvrability and mobility features makes the resource management a complicate task. So, efficient resources sharing schemes must be designed to achieve an optimized network.

3.
Trajectory Planning Trajectory planning is another major challenge for UAV assisted communication. As finding the optimal UAV path must consider several other parameters such as flight time energy constraint, collision avoidance, user requirement etc. trajectory planning is a complicated task as it needs to find infinite no optimization variables (position of UAV) (Dǒgançay, 2012; (Rucco, Aguiar, Hauser)Rucco, Aguiar, Hauser).

4.
Interference management In the case of multiple UAV deployment interference management is an important task. UAV must be deployed in such a way that their footprint is as much larger as possible while avoiding interference among them. Interference mitigation must be considered in order to maximize network efficiency in terms of throughput and coverage.

5.
Channel Modeling In any communication system, channel characteristics between transmitter and receiver greatly impact the communication quality. In case of UAV assisted communication channel characteristics in the air-ground link are much different as compared to a terrestrial deployed communication system in which only ground to ground communication links are involved and BSs are stationary only users are mobile. However, in UAV assisted communication UAV deployed BS is also mobile along with the user so it’s a mere movement greatly affects the air to ground channel characteristics (Zheng et al., 2013b). In UAV assisted communication channel characteristics to depend upon UAV location, altitude, type and elevation angle of deployed UAV, channel characteristics etc.

6.
Backhaul connectivity Wireless backhaul connectivity is another important challenging task in UAV assisted communication. Due to the flying nature of UAV wireless backhauling is required instead of wired one (Horwath et al., 2007). Different options for UAV wireless backhauling include satellite links, Wi-Fi, mm-Wave and free-space optical communication (FSO). Satellite links can provide greater backhaul capacity as compared to Wi-Fi links but low cost and less delay maintain Wi-Fi as a major candidate for wireless backhauling in UAV assisted communication. mm-Wave and FSO (Fidler et al., 2010; Alzenad et al., 2018) are sources of wider backhauling due to LoS link maintenance feature of UAV assisted communication.

7.
Energy limitations Limited onboard energy in UAV’s is a major constraint for implementation of UAV assisted communication in several scenarios. UAV’s are usually battery operated that is a limited resource. Onboard energy must be used for several tasks like transmission control, mobility management, data processing. Energy consumption also depends upon physical parameters like UAV mission details, environmental condition, UAV path planning strategy etc. Energy constraint directly defines the UAV operation lifetime. So, efficient energy utilization schemes must be designed to prolong the UAV lifetime (Uragun, 2011; Zeng and Zhang, 2017).

8.
Security Among the challenges faced by UAV assisted communication security is the major one. UAV assisted communication is a broadcasting scenario which is always controlled without human pilot intervention. Therefore, it is very much possible for hackers to attack open communication links. Strategies are required to make the communication link secure from eavesdropping, man in the middle attack any many other malicious attacks. Due to multi-layer topology of integrated UAV assisted communication networks, security is among major concerning factors and difficult to maintain between nodes of dissimilar characteristics as well. Malicious attacks can easily be launched to multilayer network topology. Resources are managed by SDN controllers in multi-layer integrated networks.Maintaining the security of SDN controllers is another important aspect of UAV assisted communication security (Javaid et al., 2012). has presented possible cyber-attacks To UAV networks. Recently several researches have addressed the UAV assisted communication security problems. Artificial intelligence based solutions has been proposed in (Challita et al., 2018) to provide secure UAV assisted communication experience. Physical layer security in presence of eavesdropper has been discussed in (Wanget al., 2018). Many research works have focused on Signal processing techniques to provide secure physical layer communication experience. Multi antenna, friendly jamming and relay selection based techniques have been utilized in (Li et al., 2019b) to strengthen the physical layer security in UAV assisted communication. Dual UAV aided secure communication is discussed in (Caiet al., 2018), where one of the UAV is utilized to jam multiple ground eavesdroppers to continue the secure communication experience of desired nodes.

4. UAV placement in 5G and beyond wireless networks
Placement is one of the greatest challenges of UAV assisted wireless communication. Despite the promising benefits of UAV aided communication, the placement problem is a challenging one. UAV’s are different from terrestrial BSs because in terrestrial case location of BS is fixed and path loss is a function of user location only. However, in the case of UAV assisted BS both user and BS are mobile. The air to the ground path between user and UAV depends on user location as well as the location of UAV BS. Also, UAV BS placement is a 3D placement problem unlike for terrestrial BS that is a 2D placement scenario. UAV placement optimization is divided into two kinds of placement problems. One is to decide the Optimal altitude at which UAV should place to cover as many users as possible and second is to 2D UAV placement to maximize the coverage area.

UAV altitude has a direct impact on communication quality. As UAVs are divided into low altitude platform and higher altitude platforms. In case of low altitude, there are fewer chances for LoS path but lower path loss factor. As the altitude increases chances of LoS path increases but at the cost of higher path loss factor due to increased distance and involved losses. UAV position has a direct impact on several performance metrics of a communication network. Network Coverage, throughput, connectivity are directly linked with the position of UAV BS. Location of UAV decides which user are under the coverage area of particular UAV. Throughput is an important network parameter. It is the rate at which information is transferred measured in bits/s. it depends upon channel bandwidth and signals to interference noise ratio. Signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) directly depends upon the location of transmitter and receiver and their distance. In case of mobile BS as in UAV assisted BS the distance between user and BS can be altered according to changing user requirements that is not possible in terrestrial BS case due to the fixed position of BS. So intelligent UAV BS placement can directly impact network performance to satisfy QoS demands from end-users (Rahman and Cho, 2018).

4.1. UAV placement as base station
1.
Single UAV Placement In (Alzenad et al., 2017) 3D placement f UAV BS is performed in such a way that it covers as many users as possible with the involvement of minimum transmitted power. UAV placement is actually 3D placement. In (Alzenad et al., 2017) placement is simplified by decomposing the 3D problem into horizontal and vertical dimensions. In vertical direction UAV placement altitude has to be optimized whereas in horizontal direction placement is addressed as 2D circle placement problem. In absence of Terrain details, one cannot determine the path is either LoS or NLoS. So averaged path loss model over LoS and NLoS paths is considered. In the vertical dimension, altitude is optimized with help of optimized elevation angle for maximum covered users. In the horizontal dimension, the placement problem is addressed by a second-order cone problem.in previous works, it was assumed that users are distributed on 2D plane. In (Shakhatreh et al., 2017) UAV, 3D placement is optimized for the case considering that users are uniformly distributed within different floors of a building. UAV is placed in such a way that it covers all the inside users with the minimum required transmitted power. ITU(international telecommunication union) certified Outdoor indoor path loss model is used (Series, 2009). Summary of contribution for single UAV placement is given in Table 1. Single UAV as base Station is shown in Fig. 9.

A particle swarm optimization-based algorithm is proposed for efficient 3D UAV placement (Kennedy and Eberhart, 1995; Clerc and Kennedy, 2002). Convergence speed of gradient descent algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm are compared for different building heights (200, 250 and 300 m) and widths (10, 30, 50 m). 3D aerial vehicle BS placement directly affects the lifetime of an ad-hoc network because UAV’s are battery operated and optimized placement directly affects the UAV energy consumption. In (Lu et al., 2017) 3D UAV placement problem is addressed in such a way that minimizes UAV recall frequency. UAV recall frequency is used to represent a lifetime of this kind of battery operated network. Minimum the recall frequency larger the lifetime of the ad-hoc network. This has again decoupled the placement problem into the horizontal and vertical dimension as in (Alzenad et al., 2017). Results show that optimal hovering altitude is directly affected by coverage radius and the slope is dependent on communication environment e.g UAV altitude is high for dense scattering environment. UAV recall frequency is plotted against different onboard circuit power values and coverage parameter (coverage radius). Results show that limiting on-board circuit power can prolong the lifetime of the network by lowering UAV recall frequency time.

Also discusses the 3D UAV placement for the case of indoor users. Where the objective is to keep the transmitted power as minimum as possible (Cui et al., 2018a). Placement is optimized for two cases in the first one transmitted power is minimized for the location inside building that has maximum path loss factor. For second case iterative and exhaustive algorithms are used for placement optimization in case of uniformly distributed users. Results show that transmitted power in the first case is much larger as compared to the second case and also increases with an increased number of users. In first case power is uniformly increased in the second case the fluctuation in transmit power are larger when users are completely randomly distributed as compared to the case of semi-random distribution. 3D UAV BS for different QoS requirement is discussed in (Chen et al., 2018a). Placement is done in such a way to maximize no of covered users with the minimum required power. 3D placement is divided into two dimensions horizontal and vertical. First altitude optimization is done with respect to the coverage area. Then placement in horizontal dimension is performed as multiple concentric circle placement problem to cover as many users as possible with different QoS requirement.

Mixed integer second order cone problem is generated and improved multiple population genetic algorithm is proposed for optimized UAV horizontal placement. Designed algorithm is much better as compared to standard genetic algorithm and CVX tool box in terms of covered users and execution time.in practical scenario different users data rate requirement varies (Lai et al., 2019) has investigated the placement problem in a scenario where user density and required data rate varies with time. Placement algorithm should be aware of users density and data rate requirements. Four different data rates full HD video streaming, online gaming, web surfing and VoIP call are considered. Vertical placement optimization is considered the same as discussed in (Al-Hourani et al., 2014). Horizontal placement problem is solved as NP-complete knapsack-like problem (Tahat et al., 2019). has discussed and designed an algorithm for optimized 3D UAV BS placement for maximized covered users. It has considered the same 3D placement strategy as discussed in (Bor-Yaliniz et al., 2016). Honey bee Algorithms proposed in (Artificial Bee Colony Alg, 2018); Karaboga, 2018) have been used to find the global maximum.

2.
Multi UAV Deployment UAV’s have become an essential component to assist 5G and beyond 5G wireless networks to satisfy ever-increasing no of users demanding connectivity and high data rate provision. Despite the promising benefits of UAV assisted communication system, there are several challenges which need to be addressed. The most important one is to how optimally place UAV. Several research works have been performed in this regard. Demand oriented UAV placement to maximize the wireless network capacity is preseted in (Sharma et al., 2017).it has considered priority wise dominance and entropy approaches to satisfy the higher capacity demands. The work in (Wang et al., 2019) is rapid deployment of minimum no of UAV’s in such a manner that they serve as many users as possible in an even fashion (Gupta et al., 2016) while maintaining a robust backbone network between UAV and fixed BS. A hybrid algorithm is proposed that decomposes this complex NP-hard problem into two steps. Firstly the minimum no of UAV’s and their optimal positions are estimated with help of greedy search algorithm in a discontinuous space then the distributed motion algorithm is used to find optimal positions of UAVs in a continuous space. The proposed algorithm is tested under two different user distribution scenario 1) Randomly distribution 2) Cluster distribution. The work in (Wang et al., 2019) has verified the proposed algorithm for both scenarios in which UAV is acting alone and in which UAV is serving the already deployed terrestrial infrastructure. Summary of contributions for MultiUAV as Base station is given in Table 2. Multi UAV as base Station is shown in Fig. 10.

The work in (Sun et al., 2019b) has discussed the placement problem of multiple UAV’s with different properties with the help of mean-field type game [MFTG] (Xu et al., 2018). The decision of each UAV will impact mean-field term. And each UAV will decide its optimal placement strategy depending upon its own state and mean-field term in order to achieve the Nash equilibrium of the system in terms of optimal UAV’s placement. In multi UAV environment, there are several challenges other than placement. Among them, energy efficiency is extremely important to be considered. The work in (Ruanet al., 2018) has proposed the algorithm for multi UAV coverage problem keeping in mind the energy efficiency factor as well (Omri et al., 2018). has proposed 3D placement strategies of multiple UAV’s in-network flying platform (NFP) environment. It has used both distributed placement algorithm (DPA) and centric placement algorithm (CPA) to propose two placement strategies. Distributed placement algorithm based strategy can be implemented by combine operation of users and high altitude mother NFP. Optimal placement algorithm based strategy is implemented at mother UAV for optimized placement (Khuwaja et al., 2019). have discussed the multiple UAV placement optimization problems in presence of co-channel interference (Challita et al., 2019). It has considered both symmetric and asymmetric placement strategies of UAV’s with common altitude and transmit power and different altitude and transmit power respectively.

4.2. UAV placement as flying relay
UAV’s are becoming a crucial part of 5G and beyond communication networks. An important aspect of UAV is that it has limited computation and storage capacity. So, it has to act as a relay node towards a ground control station. Researches have done several works on UAV placement as flying relay (Ono et al., 2016; Larsen et al., 2017; Zeng et al., 2016e). have discussed UAV relay placement considering the maximum relaying distance. The work in (Chen et al., 2018b) has focused on estimating the optimized altitude for UAV acting as a flying relay for maximum reliability factor. UAV as flying relay altitude is optimized for both cases 1) Static UAV 2) Mobile UAV. Power loss, outage probability and bit error rate have been used as reliability performance metrics. Results indicate that with the variation of performance metrics optimum altitude varies. It has discussed both relaying strategies Decode and forward (DF) and amplify and forward (AF). With the help of numerical results (Chen et al., 2018b) indicate that decode DF relaying strategy performs better than AF (Wei et al., 2017). have considered the UAV relaying node placement problem in a wireless regenerative communication system in which UAV is acting as a relay node between mobile station and BS. First, the convex placement problem is designed considering the outage probability as a performance metric. UAV placement as flying relay is shown in Fig. 11. Summary of contributions for UAV as Relay is given in Table 3.

Later on the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions, also known as the Kuhn–Tucker condition-based UAV placement is optimized. Results indicate that optimal UAV placement is directly affected by the ratio of transmitted power between UAV and BS. The work in (Esrafilian et al., 2018) have considered the optimized UAV placement problem as flying relay between users and fixed BS. UAV placement is optimized for maximum network throughput as considered in terrain situation. It has considered the 3D map-based approach in which prior knowledge of the user’s position and path loss is missing. Optimization is done in such a way that firstly, user location and path loss information is collected bases on UAV collected data. Based on collected data UAV position is optimized using an iterative algorithm (Chen et al., 2019). has considered the UAV relay node placement in 3D space where the purpose of a relay is to ensure the communication link availability between BS and a single user in case of terrain blockage.so Quality of Service for the targeted user is guaranteed. The work in (Chen et al., 2019) has considered the actual terrain structure. Results indicate that considering actual terrain structure provides substantial performance gains as compared to stochastic terrain-based approaches. Clustering model-based UAV relay placement is presented in (Gaofeng et al., 2019). It has considered both used UAV numbers and network performance jointly as performance metric forming a multi-objective placement problem. The objective of the placement problem is to optimally place multiple UAV’s acting as relay nodes. Two-tiered relay network is considered in (Gaofeng et al., 2019). The work in (Chen and Gesbert, 2020); Rubin and Zhang, 2007) has also considered UAV relay node placement problem.

UAV’s Placement in sensor networks

UAV’s in remote sensing network is a new addition to the surveillance operation. A flying device is used to collect physical details of the specific area while keeping itself at a distance from the targeted area. UAV’s are very useful in this aspect as their deployment in a particularly hard to reach the area is very convenient and less expensive. Several research works have been performed in this regard to address the placement problem of UAV in sensor networks. The work in (Sujit et al., 2013) has discussed the UAV route planning in order to make it the most efficient method for data collection from sensor networks. As UAV deployment convenience make it most suitable solution for remote data collection however efficient route planning is required in order to maximize the network life time (Sujit et al., 2013). have considered joint route planning for UAV and sensor networks. It has decomposed the optimization problem into subproblems. In first step clusters are made in the second step connection between clusters are optimized in third step route inside the cluster is optimized and in last step UAV path for data collection between clusters is optimized (Ho et al., 2013). have proposed a particle swarm optimization-based method for optimized path planning. Energy consumption, BER(bit error rate) and UAV flight time are considered as the performance metric. UAV waypoint relays are used for more efficient data collection (Abdelkader et al., 2014). have discussed the UAV path planning for flash flood sensing. As floods are among the biggest disastrous situation that can occur so accurate methods are required for sensing and emergency response in order to save lives. As the flood situation is very unpredictable. no-body knows what happens next so accurate path planning for sensing agents to get some meaningful data is a crucial task. The work in (Abdelkader et al., 2014) has discussed a numerical based approach for UAV trajectory planning to get accurate results while keeping time horizon in mind as well (Haugen and Imsland, 2016). have discussed path planning for aerial sensor network for surveillance of moving objects on the surface. Remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) act as sensing node. RPAS send collected data to the observer for raw data and other input processing. Observer output is provided to path planner for trajectory guidance. Farming in the mountain area is a difficult task e.g. farm land in southwest China is very irregular. UAV’s are the most convenient option for information gathering in such hard to reach farming areas (Yanget al., 2016). have presented ant colony optimization-based method for UAV route planning in order to ensure minimized delay and energy consumption for farmland information gathering (Monwar et al., 2018). have discussed energy-efficient path planning for swarms of UAV’s used for autonomous inspection of geographical area. Energy consumption is considered at all the operation stages including flying, hovering and data transmission. In practical scenarios, IoT nodes have to upload their sensor data with in limited time to remotely located control stations for necessary actions. If IoT nodes are situated in hard to reach area then UAV is the best option for gathering sensor nodes data.([114].) Have discussed optimized path planning for UAV’s that are acting as data collection points for time-constrained IoT nodes. Summary of contribution for UAV as user Equipment is given in Table 4.

5. Resource allocation in 5G and beyond 5G wireless networks
With ever-increasing, no of users demanding data rate and connectivity, 5G and beyond has to introduce new technological trends like UAV assisted BS. These mobile BS has several challenges which need to be addressed in order to use them efficiently. Among those challenges resource management in UAV assisted Het-Net is the most promising challenge. Some of the resources whose optimized allocation in UAV assisted 5G communication network can lead to optimized wireless communication scenario are as follows:

•
Energy

•
Bandwidth

•
Time Slot

•
User association

•
Power

Following section discusses the state of the art work related to above mentioned resource management techniques one by one (Patra and Muthuchidambaranathan, 2018; Manzoor et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019; Amorosi et al., 2018; Chakareski et al., 2019). have discussed the energy optimization in UAV assisted wireless communication scenario. Optimized bandwidth allocation is considered in (Zhang et al., 2018a; Cao et al., 2019; Zeng et al., 2019; Li and Xu, 2018; He et al., 2019; Si et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2019; Wen et al., 2019; Yan et al., 2019; Pan et al., 2019; Saleem et al., 2015). (Cheon et al., 2017; Patra and Muthuchidambaranathan, 2018; Jiang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2017; Yin et al., 2019; Park et al., 2019; Ye et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2019) have considered optimized time slot allocation and user association in (Pan et al., 2018, 2019; Huang et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2019c; Hu et al., 2019) have been considered (Pan et al., 2018; Liu and Ansari, 2019; Cao et al., 2019; Gong et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2018a; Song et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019a; Chen, 2020; Zeng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018b).] have discussed power optimization problem. Summary of contribution for UAV Resource Management is given in Table 5.

1.
Energy Initially, UAV’s were deployed only for military purposes. However due to easy deployment, manoeuvrability, LoS communication link and several other benefits they have developed their place very rapidly in fields like agriculture, surveillance, remote sensing wireless communication and several others. UAV’s are mobile terminal with onboard limited energy resource. So efficient UAV operation directly dependent on efficient energy utilization schemes. Different research studies (Manzoor et al., 2019; Chakareski et al., 2019) have contributed to efficient energy utilization problem. Study in (Manzoor et al., 2019) have presented an efficient energy utilization problem as weight optimization scheme. A heuristic approach is presented to determine the weights of energy assignment between UAV BS and terrestrial BS. Received SINR at each node is considered as metric to assign weights. Nodes with a better SINR level are assigned more weights in order to satisfy the QoS demands of each user. The unlicensed band named licensed assisted access (LAA) is a major source to enhance the available network bandwidth capacity. The work in (Xu et al., 2019) have considered the on-board energy optimization problem for UAV enabled eLAA (enhanced licensed access) network. eLAA is a modified version with LAA integrated with IEEE 802.11e protocol. Both small cell BS (SBS) and wifi access points are UAV mounted. Users are distributed into two VIP and non-VIP categories according to their subscription type. VIP users are connected with SBS and non-VIP with the wifi access point. Energy-efficient downlink communication is ensured via joint Resources and trajectory optimization. Hyper access point (HAP) (Chen et al., 2017) and transmit opportunity (Chen et al., 2018c) benefits are combined to design eLAA network. UAVs are considered the most suitable candidate for providing services to low-income areas (Amorosi et al., 2018). have considered the rural area coverage planning problem with the constraint of energy efficiency. It has planned UAV flight over multiple time slots in such a way that it provides complete coverage to already set targeted areas with the minimized energy utilization.Results indicate that proposed RURAL PLAN is abble to achieve a reduction of more than 60% of consumed energy compared to MAXCOV (Chakareski et al., 2019). have considered the energy efficiency problem in heterogeneous network scenario consisting of small cells, dual-mode mm-Wave ground located small cells and Macro BS (Chakareski et al., 2019). have solved the optimization problem into two layers. The outer layer is for optimized UAV placement and the inner layer is the optimized energy resource management. Results indicate that addition of UAV tier into heterogeneous network almost doubles the EE(energy efficiency) and increase in UAV altitude increases the energy efficiency but after certain threshold altitude EE start to decrease with increased altitude.Results indicate that the system energy efficiency is 35% greater at UAV altitude of 140 m as compared to the altitude value of 10 m. After this altititude EE start to decrease. EE Vs τ graph shows that when τ = 0 dB system EE is 2 times greater. For power minimization technique is 88% lower.

2.
Bandwidth UAVs are becoming very popular day by day because of its numerous military and civil applications. According to Teal group report that combined (Military and civil) UAV production will reach up to 20.3 billion dollars in 2025 from 2016’s 4.5 billion dollars. And it is expected to reach 135 billion dollars in next 10 years (Systems Market Profile an, 2016; Teal Group, 2016). This rapid increase demand for efficient bandwidth allocation schemes considering the scarcity of bandwidth resource.Cognative radio technology has emerged as a promising candidate to tackle the spectrum scarcity problem in UAV assisted communication (Saleem et al., 2015). has discussed the opportunities and challenges for combining UAV’s with cognative radio network to efficiently utilize the spectrum resource. (CRT) (Zhang et al., 2018a) have discussed the iterative method and proposed a novel algorithm iterative subcarrier allocation and trajectory design(ISATCA). Subcarrier allocation problem is decomposed in two scenarios.

UAV to UAV(U2U) carrier allocation.

It has considered the single cell with multiple users and serving UAVs. Results indicate 20 per cent better uplink sum rate as compared to non U2U communication methods (Cao et al., 2019). have considered the optimized carrier allocation problem in a scenario where UAV is deployed to collect data from IoT nodes. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based channel and power allocation algorithm is proposed for max-min energy efficiency among all the IoT nodes. The proposed algorithm outperforms as compared with deep Q networks (DQN) method, and random method (Zeng et al., 2019). has considered the subchannel allocation problem in a scenario where UAV is acting as a relay node to provide better QoS services to users located at the edge of the cell. Joint mode selection and sub-channel allocation, trajectory optimization, and power allocation (JMS-T-P) algorithm are proposed to solve the NP - hard problem. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms in terms of network throughput and user fairness as compared to the random algorithm and cellular schemes (Li and Xu, 2018). have presented optimized bandwidth and power allocation in UAV assisted network considering multi-hop backhaul network as well along with the access network. Alternating optimization and successive convex programming are used to get local optimum solution. Numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme outperforms as compared to benchmark schemes (He et al., 2019). have considered subcarrier allocation problem in a scenario where the drone is acting as amplify and forward relay in emergency communication. The objective is to do joint subcarrier and power allocation optimization to maximize uplink network throughput.Results indicate that throughput of prosed algorithm increaseswith no of users and becomes constant at no of users = 8, whereas standard algorithm performance decreases (Si et al., 2015). have considered the optimized bandwidth allocation problem in heterogeneous UAV networks(distributed Ad-Hoc wireless). By heterogeneity means a network not only consisting of UAV’s but also supporting ground and satellite nodes along with data transmission links that are used to connect all the entities. Work is divided into Action, networking and processing planes. Action plane collects all sensing data towards processing plane with the help of networking plane.Proposed scheme to solve the distributed optimization problem improves the spectrum efficiency by 75% with respect to existing scheme. By varying the few parameter values proposed scheme doubles the spectrum efficiency. Optimized bandwidth allocation and user scheduling problem for relay acting as decode and forward is presented in (Hu et al., 2019) To solve the convex optimization problem a block successive convex optimization algorithm(BSCA) is presented.Proposed method offers same throughput with less complexity and simulation time.With larger T(duration of period) e.g T = 300s, the running time of proposed algorithm is 7% smaller as compared to standard schemes. Optimized Sub carrier allocation to maximize the secondary user’s average throughput (non convex problem)in UAV assisted cognitive radio networks is presented in (Wen et al., 2019). Bandwidth allocation problem in UAV assisted IoT networks is presented in (Yan et al., 2019). Both game theory and stochastic geometry-based approaches are utilized for UAV access and efficient resource allocation between BS and UAV’s.A non-cooperative game for UAV bandwidth allocation is presented. Results indicate the efficiency of proposed algorithm by achievement of equilibrium state of proposed algorithm through few iterations (Pan et al., 2019). have focused on efficient bandwidth allocation problem in UAV assisted software-defined cellular network (SDCN).Algorithm is proposed for joint optimized UAV placement, user scheduling and bandwidth allocation problem.Results indicate that maximal throughput gain is as large as 74.9% on average for all users, in comparison with other state of the art schemes.

3.
Time slot (Cheon et al., 2017) Proposes the TDMA based dynamic time slot allocation scheme to satisfy QoS demand of end-users while maintaining as much throughput as possible. Results indicate that the proposed Dynamic time slot allocation scheme is better in terms of throughput as compared to a fixed time-slot allocation method. it provides following data rates for uplink (38,435),down link (50,460),Voice(34,633) and video(282,502) which are higher as compared to fixed unit time slot method and it also satisfies minimum data rate requirement of end users (Patra and Muthuchidambaranathan, 2018; Zhang et al., 2017). have maximized the spectrum and energy efficiency for a wireless communication scenario by designing a time allocation scheme in which UAV is acting as decode and forward (DF)relay node between ground transmitter and receiver whose direct communication link is no more available. UAV is utilizing Time-division duplexing (TDD) based relay mode and its trajectory is assumed to be a circular path. So UAV time allocation is optimized along with its speed and trajectory to maximize the spectrum and energy efficiency of the system. [ (Patra and Muthuchidambaranathan, 2018),(Zhang et al., 2017)] have used the bisection method to design a time allocation scheme.results indicate that there exists a tradeoff between spectrum and energy efficiency (Jiang et al., 2019) (Yin et al., 2019) (Park et al., 2019) (Ye et al., 2019). have considered time slot allocation problem in wireless powered UAV communication networks (Jiang et al., 2019). have considered a UAV based communication network in which UAV has a continuous power supply and it is supplying power to communication nodes wirelessly. First, lambert function is used to derive a closed form solution for TDMA based time allocation problem. Optimized time allocation is used to reform a new optimization problem to optimize the UAV placement problem(non convex). Results indicate that proposed algorithm outperforms as compared to other benchmark schemes. it has same convergence rate(only 5 iterations) as Dinkelbach based algorithm.numerical results in (Yin et al., 2019) shows that both proposed solutions(TDMA, FDMA) outperform equal share strategy. however maximum throughput and performance gap with equal share strategy decreases with increase in path loss exponent and no of users.it is worthy to note that FDMA perform better than TDMA and still outperforms the equal share strategy with the increase in no of users.As path loss exponent increases more energy required by both FDMA and TDMA however with increase in no of users wireless charging duration of both FDMA and TDMA behaves differently, with FDMA it decreases and with TDMA it remains constant (Park et al., 2019) have considered a time allocation problem in UAV assisted IoT network scenario where firstly ground nodes are wirelessly powered by UAV’s, then the ground nodes send their information signal towards UAV in the up link direction.Results indicate that minimum throughput performance of separated UAV wireless powered communication network (WPCN) is 28% larger than integrated UAV WPCN. At T = 110 s, the minimum throughput performance of the separated UAV WPCN is about 16% larger than that of the integrated UAV WPCN and also proposed algorithm reaches a stable point after 15 iterations. It has considered two cases in first case wireless charging and information reception is occurring at the same UAV whereas in second case two separate UAV are used for charging and information reception purpose. Joint placement and resource allocation optimization is performed to maximize the minimum throughput of ground terminals. In resource allocation time allocation for both information transfer and wireless charging link along with joint uplink power are optimized by a proposed iterative algorithm. Optimized hovering and flying time allocation in Full duplex IoT network that is wirelessly powered by UAV nodes is presented in (Ye et al., 2019). Objective is to maximize the network throughput of all connected IoT nodes.Results indicate that increase in distance between sensor nodes and uAV altitude have negative impacts on sum throughput (Guo et al., 2019) have considered the case of downlink wireless communication network in which UAV is acting as a communication node for ground terminals but it requires to continuously recharge at regular intervals in order to continue the services. Maximization of the minimum average rate of ground terminals is performed by Optimized Time allocation between charging and service duration of UAV node. Joint power, time allocation and trajectory optimization is performed via successive convex optimization technique.

User association UAV is a promising solution to handle the unexpected situation like sudden increases in users or a failure of infrastructure either due to some disaster or malfunctioning equipment. Efficient resource allocation is the only way to achieve optimized results (Pan et al., 2018). have presented the optimized UAV placement problem. As there is a trade-off between no of associated users and the power associated with UAV BS. So in (Pan et al., 2018) UAV placement is optimized in order to achieve the optimized results in terms of user association and power in software-defined cellular networks. It also ensured the associated users QoS requirement. It has considered three cases 1)Optimized 3D placement for fixed UAV power, 2)Optimized 3D placement and optimized resource allocation, 3)2D placement with optimized resource allocation. Results indicated that the proposed algorithm (case 2) has the best trade-off utility and downlink served user per transmission power of UAV in both urban and dense urban environment. Maximum reachable data rate gain with proposed scheme is 39.79% (Huang et al., 2019). have presented joint 3D placement, user association and power allocation problem in simultaneous wireless information and power transfer networks where UAV is transferring both information and energy to ground IoT nodes. 3D UAV placement and user association are completely related problems. Mixed-integer variables are used to handle the complex problem of joint placement and user association. The objective is to maximize the minimum data rate provided to ground users. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm enables the UAV optimal placement maximizing the power transfer to ground nodes (Sun et al., 2019c). have presented the UAV placement and user association problem in UAV assisted mobile networks for the load balancing purpose. Users are divided into cluster form. Initially, maximal user density is used to place the UAV as a starting location. Then UAV assisted BSs are deployed in such a way to minimize the maximum traffic demand by a user cluster with help of backtracking line algorithm. Then altitude optimization is performed for the power-efficient system. By alternate implementation of load balancing and location algorithms, optimum UAV position is achieved in order to achieve the load-balanced system. Results indicate that the proposed scheme outperforms as compared to SINR based approaches.Clustering method results in to 3.71% users without service and 0.0014 traffic load balancing which is much better as compared to 6.94% user without service and 0.0023 balancing index of uniformly distributed points (Hu et al., 2019). have maximized the minimum throughput of the system by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, user scheduling and bandwidth allocation scheme in a UAV Decode and Forward(DF) Relay system.Results indicate that maximal throughput gain is 74.9% on average for all users in proposed method. As UAV’s are battery operated mobile stations so power limitation is a major concern inefficient utilization of UAV as BS. Recently The concept of wireless charging stations have greatly emerged after the UAV have become a crucial part of 5G and beyond wireless communication systems (Yin et al., 2020). have presented the user association problem in wirelessly charged UAV BS with optimized resource allocation and placement. User scheduling in software-defined cellular network is presented in (Pan et al., 2019).

Power (Li and Xu, 2018) have discussed optimized placement along with joint power and bandwidth allocation problem in both access and backhaul network. In UAV assisted MTD power allocation for data relaying at UAV directly affects the UAV hover time (Liu and Ansari, 2019). have presented the UAV transmission power minimization problem (Convex Problem) in order to maximize the hover time in UAV assisted M2M communication environment. Results indicate that as the (SD) source-destination pairs increase UAV transmission power increases. The proposed scheme minimizes transmission power by intelligent selection of HMTD and resource allocation as compared to general RAS (Resource allocation scheme) which do not involve intelligent selection feature. In (Cao et al., 2019) deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm is presented for intelligent power allocation for uplink transmission of IoT nodes in UAV assisted IoT networks. The proposed algorithm outperforms in terms of maximizing the minimum energy efficiency of IoT nodes. A power allocation algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for UAV relay network is presented in (Gong et al., 2018). Results indicate that the proposed algorithm reduces the no of iterations to gets to the optimized solution.Proposed algorithm outperform in terms of convergence rate and stability.it requires less than 10 iterations to reach the centralized optimal solution.Throughput performance of proposed method is higher as compared to other benchmark schemes. In (Jiang et al., 2018a) End to end throughput maximization via Power and trajectory optimization(non convex problem) for amplify and forward UAV Relay network is presented. The proposed iterative algorithm for power and trajectory optimization shows significant throughput increase(600+ bits/s/Hz) as compared to fixed power and trajectory options(500bits/s/Hz). Joint beamforming and power allocation design methods for decode and forward UAV relaying network is presented in (Song et al., 2018). First, the beamforming optimized results are derived based on the maximum ratio combing approach in both UAV receiving and forwarding stage. Then the power allocation problem is addressed based on the optimized beam forming results in order to improve the end to end performance of the network. Optimized power allocation for maximizing the network throughput in floating relay assisted indoor users is presented in (Li et al., 2019a). Joint power allocation, node scheduling and trajectory optimization (derived mixed integer non Convex optimization problem) to maximize the minimum average user rate in UAV relay network is proposed in (Chen, 2020). An iterative algorithm based on block coordinated decent and successive convex optimization is presented in (Chen, 2020) TDMA(time division multiple access) is used for information transmission and reception via UAV (Zeng et al., 2018). have discussed the optimized power allocation problem in a scenario in which UAV is acting like a decode and forward relay in order to enhance the BS coverage range. Transmitted power of both mobile device and UAV is optimized along with the UAV trajectory in order to minimize the outage probability of the network. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms as compared to circle trajectory with power allocation scheme (CT-PA) and fixed position with equal transmit power scheme (FT-EP).In proposed scheme outage probability decreases with increase of maximum transmit power. Joint power and trajectory optimization for a scenario in which multiple UAV’s are acting as relay nodes between source and destination is presented in (Zhang et al., 2018b). An iterative algorithm is proposed to maximize the end to end throughput. Results indicate that the proposed scheme for the non convex problem outperforms as compared to static relay scheme when T > 205s (P = 10dBm) and T > 150s(P = 0dBm).

6. Future direction
Due to several potential benefits of UAV assisted wireless communication its getting technology of the era at a very faster pace. But it’s still in its infant stages and has several research areas which need to be addressed properly in order to make UAV as a potential candidate for wireless communication in coming years.

•
Energy Efficiency UAV operational flight lifetime is constrained by on-board energy and on-board energy is limited by SWaP(size, weight and power) constraint. Main components of UAV energy consumption include communication and propulsion energy. Generally, UAV propulsion energy is much higher as compared to communication energy. Efficient on-board energy allocation is an important research area in order to enhance the operational lifetime of UAV assisted communication. Researchers are working on improving on-board energy resources by introducing new battery technologies such as lithium-ion batteries and hydrogen fuel cells. Another future area is energy harvesting and wireless power transfer by utilization the green energy sources e.g: solar energy. They increase the operational lifetime of UAV’s without adding extra masses to them that is crucial for satisfying SWaP constraint as well. That makes energy harvesting and wireless power transfer very hot future trends in UAV assisted communication. Antenna array designing for wireless power transfer is another important research area.

•
Channel Modeling Due to low cost, easy handling, manoeuvrability LoS and adaptive communication UAV’s will not only be limited to particular areas in upcoming future but they will be deployed in far-flung areas, roads, ruler, urban areas indoor and outdoor, stadiums and several other public areas as well. Better aerial channel characteristic modelling for all different more realistic scenarios mentioned above along with different weather conditions and for more irregular surfaces is important future research direction to have better wireless communication experience. Small scale fading for both moving and static A2G(air to ground) channel modelling also need to be explored widely.A2A(air to air) channel modelling is another important future research direction to model the Doppler effects and multipath fading due to mobility of UAV’s as UAV’s are coming more into the scene as an aerial base station, aerial UE, Relaying, FANet’s(flying ad-hoc network) and backhaul support networks.

•
3D UAV Placement Optimization As UAV’s are becoming more common as flying base station Placement is an important research area. There are several open research areas related to the placement problem. UAV base station coexists with terrestrial BS better interference management techniques between two of them is an important future research direction to have better communication experience. As resources are always limited and key network controlling factor, several research studies are being conducted to get the solution in terms of optimized 3D placement to maximize the network throughput along with optimized resource allocation.

•
Trajectory Planning As UAV assisted 5G and beyond communication is becoming a major game-changer in the upcoming future, Now swarms of UAV’s forming flying Ad-hoc wireless network are utilized. When multiple UAV’s are involved then how to plan their trajectory that covers Maximum ground users while keeping the links alive and working between UAV’s along with maintaining the collision avoidance between UAV’s is an important future research direction.

•
Wireless backhaul Connectivity Despite several benefits of UAV assisted wireless communication with respect to terrestrial communication wireless backhaul connectivity requirement is a challenging task in UAV assisted communication. Currently utilized satellite links as wireless backhauls are inefficient due to the high cost and latency problems involved with satellite links. So, researchers are working for solving efficient wireless backhaul connectivity problem involving low cost, low latency and high throughput.UAV to satellite link exploring for better back-hauling or looking for alternative back-hauling methods other than satellites for example the drone deployed UAV’s for back-hauling or utilizing the existing terrestrial infrastructure is an important future research direction.

•
Privacy and Security UAV assisted wireless communication network is suspect-able to malicious attacks e.g eavesdropping, a man in the middle attack etc because of open links present in Space-Air-Ground integrated network.UAV’s are always more prone to cyber-attacks because of an absence of manual control. An attacker can easily take control of UAV sensory data and reprogram it that will lead to a vulnerable situation. Currently, researchers are working in involving artificial intelligence to avoid such situations. Still, there is immense room for the betterment of security and privacy techniques for UAV’s assisted communication link to avoid such malicious attacks.
