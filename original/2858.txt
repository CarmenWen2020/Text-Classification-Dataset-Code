Dominance-based rough set approach is successfully applied to analyze multicriteria decision problems. For the incomplete ordered decision system, its various extensions have been proposed. The valued dominance relation is such an extension. However, the general calculation of dominance degree between objects depends on a prior distribution of incomplete ordered decision system, and how to choose a suitable threshold is also difficult. To solve these problems, a data-driven valued dominance relation is proposed in this paper. First of all, an objective calculation method of dominance degree between objects is designed, which is based on probability statistics. Moreover, this method is more effective for big data sets with a large quantity of objects. Secondly, an automatic threshold calculation method is presented, which does not depend on any prior knowledge except data sets. Finally, some properties of this method are investigated. Experimental results show that this method is superior to other generalized dominance relations in dealing with incomplete information.

Introduction
The rough set theory developed by Pawlak [18] cannot be directly used to analyze incomplete information systems where all attributes are regular attributes, and there are some unknown attribute values. Its various extensions have been proposed in [8,9,10, 15, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26]. In [24], Wang et al. analyzed the limitations of these extensions and pointed out that the valued tolerance relation had a strong adaptability in dealing with incomplete information. Moreover, they presented data-driven valued tolerance relation, which does not depend on any prior knowledge except the data sets. Later, this method was improved by Xu and Hu [27].

In order to analyze the ordered decision system (ODS), the dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA) was proposed by Greco et al. [7]. This method is based on the dominance relation and has been widely used in multicriteria decision analysis [6, 12, 19]. At present, DRSA has been extended for different types of ODSs [17, 25, 29]. Moreover, variable-consistency DRSA [1] and variable precision DRSA [30] were proposed for the inconsistency caused by recording error and measurement error. In addition, some incremental updating algorithms for approximation and attribute reduction of ODS were proposed [2, 5, 14].

Especially, to handle incomplete ODS (IODS) with unknown criterion values, some generalized dominance relations were proposed, such as tolerance dominance relation [11], similarity dominance relation [28], limited tolerance dominance relation [13], and valued dominance relation [16]. In [22], Szelag et al. analyzed the properties of the extended rough set models. The relationship among them is shown in Fig. 1, and similar results can be found in [4]. It can be seen that these extensions are constructed based on different understandings of unknown values.

The valued dominance relation has stronger adaptability than other generalized dominance relations in dealing with incomplete information. First, the dominance degree between the objects is calculated based on the probability theory. Secondly, the prior threshold determines whether the objects satisfy dominance relation and can be adjusted dynamically to adapt to different IODSs. However, in valued dominance relations proposed by Liang et al. [16], the probability distribution of criterion values in each criterion domain is subjectively assumed to be uniform, and the setting of the threshold depends on the prior knowledge. Therefore, we propose a data-driven valued dominance relation (DVD) to solve these problems. First of all, a calculation method of dominance degree between objects is designed by using the theory of probability and statistics. Secondly, an automatic threshold selection algorithm is presented, which only depends on the data sets.

The following parts are organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the typical generalized dominance relations and analyzes their limitations. In Sect. 3, the calculation method of dominance degree between objects and an automatic threshold selection algorithm are proposed, and the properties concerning DVD are also examined. Section 4 presents experimental results. Section 5 summarizes the paper.

Generalized dominance relations and their limitations
ODS and dominance relation
Formally, an ODS < U, C ∪ D > , where U is the universe of objects, C ∩ D  = ∅, C is the set of condition criteria, and D is the set of decision criteria. In this paper, Vb denotes the domain of criterion b ∈ C ∪ D, and the criterion value of object x on criterion b is simply written as b(x).

The division of D on U is CL  = {Cls: s  = 1,2,…,n}, such that each x ∈ U belongs to one and only one Cls ∈ CL. For any s > t, the object in Cls is better than that in Clt. Moreover, the upward union set is Cl≥s=∪nt=sClt, and the downward union set is Cl≤s=∪st=1Clt.

In addition, the ODS with some unknown condition criterion values is called IODS, otherwise complete ODS (CODS). In this paper, all the unknown values in IODS are represented by ‘*’. And each object in U has at least one known value, i.e., for each x ∈ U there exists a ∈ C such that a(x) ≠ *.

Definition 1
[7]. For a given CODS < U, C ∪ D > , the dominance relation DA with respect to A ⊆ C is defined as

DA={<x,y>∈U2:∀a∈A(a(x)≥a(y))},
(1)
where a(x) ≥ a(y) means x is no worse than y on a. The lower approximation and upper approximation of classes Cl≥s,Cl≤s, 1 ≤ s ≤ n, are defined as

DA––––(Cl≥s)={x∈U:D+A(x)⊆Cl≥s},DA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl≥s)=∪x∈Cl≥sD+A(x),
(2)
DA––––(Cl≤s)={x∈U:D−A(x)⊆Cl≤s},DA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl≤s)=∪x∈Cl≤sD−A(x),
(3)
where D+A(x)= {y ∈ U: < y, x >  ∈ DA} and D−A(x)  = {y ∈ U: < x, y >  ∈ DA} are the dominating set and dominated set of object x, respectively.

Typical generalized dominance relations in IODS
Definition 2
For a given IODS < U, C ∪ D > and A ⊆ C, the typical generalized dominance relations are respectively defined as:

● Tolerance dominance relation (TD) introduced by Greco et al. [11]

TDA={<x,y>∈U2:∀a∈A(a(x)=∗∨a(y)=∗∨a(x)≥a(y))}.
(4)
The tolerance dominating set and tolerance dominated set of object x are TD+A(x) = {y ∈ U: <y, x> ∈TDA} and TD−A(x) = {y∈U: <x, y> ∈TDA}, respectively.

● Similarity dominance relation (SD) introduced by Yang et al. [28]

SDA={<x,y>∈U2:∀a∈A(a(x)=∗∨a(x)≥a(y))}.
(5)
The similarity dominating set and similarity dominated set of object x are SD+A(x) = {y ∈ U: <y, x>∈SDA} and SD−A(x) = {y ∈ U: <x, y>∈SDA}, respectively.

● Limited tolerance dominance relation (LD) introduced by Hu et al. [13]

LDA={<x,y>∈U2:NA(x,y)≠∅∧<x,y>∈TDA},
(6)
where NA(x,y) = {a∈A: a(x) = maxVa ∨ a(y) = minVa ∨ (a(x)≠* ∧ a(y)≠*)}, maxVa and minVa respectively denote the best value and the worst value of all known values in Va. The limited tolerance dominating set and limited tolerance dominated set of object x are LD+A(x)= {y∈U: <y,x>∈LDA} and LD−A(x) = {y∈U: <x,y>∈LDA}, respectively.

● Uniform valued dominance relation (UVD) introduced by Liang et al. [16]

UVDαA={<x,y>∈U2:P≥A(x,y)≥α}∪IU,
(7)
P≥A(x,y)=∏a∈AP≥{a}(x,y),
(8)
P≥{a}(x,y)=⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪01|{v:v∈Va∧v≥a(y)}||Va||{v:v∈Va∧a(x)≥v}||Va|12+12|Va|a(x)≠∗∧a(y)≠∗∧¬(a(x)≥a(y))a(x)≠∗∧a(y)≠∗∧a(x)≥a(y)a(x)=∗∧a(y)≠∗a(x)≠∗∧a(y)=∗a(x)=∗∧a(y)=∗
(9)
where the threshold α ∈(0,1], IU = {<x, x>: x ∈U}, |X| denotes the cardinality of set X, P≥A(x,y) and P≥{a}(x,y) denote the probability of x dominating y on A and a, respectively. In (9), when a(x)=* and a(y)=*, the derivation process of P≥{a}(x,y) is as follows:

P≥{a}(x,y)========P{a(x)≥a(y)}∑|Va|i=1(P{a(x)≥a(y)|a(y)=ai}×P{a(y)=ai})∑|Va|i=1[(∑al∈Va∧al≥aiP{a(x)=al|a(y)=ai})×P{a(y)=ai}]∑|Va|i=1(|{al∈Va:al≥ai}||Va|×1|Va|)1|Va|2∑|Va|i=1|{al∈Va:al≥ai}|1|Va|2×(1+2+⋯+|Va|)1|Va|2×|Va|(|Va|+1)212+12|Va|
The valued dominating set and valued dominated set of object x are UVDα,+A(x) = {y ∈ U:<y, x> ∈ UVDαA} and UVDα,−A(x) = {y ∈ U: <x, y> ∈ UVDαA(x)}, respectively.

Obviously, TDA, SDA and LDA only consider the preference order of objects on known criterion values, but ignore the possibility that they satisfy dominance relation on unknown criterion values. While UVDαA considers this possibility, and its calculation method is introduced under the subjective assumption that there is a uniform probability distribution in Va of each a ∈ C, i.e., P{a(x)  = ai}  = 1/|Va| for ∀x ∈ U and ∀ai ∈ Va. So, these generalized dominance relations have their own limitations. An example is illustrated as follows.

Example 1
Table 1 shows an IODS < U, C ∪ D >, which concerns ten students described by four different courses ( i.e., four condition criteria): Mathematics c1, Physics c2, Literature c3, and Sports c4. Global evaluation d is the only decision criterion. That’s to say, U  = {x1, x2,…,x10}, C  = {c1,c2,c3,c4}, D  = {d}. Besides, Vc  = Vd  = {1(Bad), 2(Pass), 3(Medium), 4(Good)} for any c ∈ C.

Table 1 Student evaluations with unknown values
Full size table
The aforementioned generalized dominance relations are used to analyze Table 1 as follows.

According to definition (4), there are < x1, x2 > ,  < x2, x1 >  ∈ TDC. But x1 and x2 do not explicitly satisfy the dominance relation on any c in C, and this implies that they have little possibility of satisfying dominance relation on C.

According to definition (5), there is < x3, x4 >  ∉ SDC. But x3 certainly dominates x4 on all the criteria.

According to definition (6), there is < x2, x4 > , < x4, x2 >  ∈ LDC. On the one hand, x2 certainly dominates x4 only on c3, and the possibility of x2 dominating x4 on C is small. On the other hand, x4 certainly dominates x2 on c3 and c4. Obviously, the possibility of x2 dominating x4 on C is different from that of x4 dominating x2 on C, but LD cannot distinguish it.

According to definitions (8) and (9), there are

P≥C(x1,x5)=24×24×34×1=316andP≥C(x1,x7)=34×24×24×1=316
Therefore, under the assumption of uniform probability distribution in the domain of each criterion, the possibility of x1 dominating x5 on C is equal to that of x1 dominating x7 on C. If we take the frequency of each criterion value as its probability, the probabilities of x1 dominating x5 and x7 on C are

38×26×78×1=764and68×26×68×1=1264,
respectively. Obviously, this result is more objective and reasonable, especially for big data sets with a large quantity of objects.

DVD: data-driven valued dominance relation
In UVD, all possible values in the domain of each criterion are assumed to be uniformly distributed for any IODSs, and the threshold selection method depends on prior knowledge. In this section, for big data sets, we will discuss how to use probability and statistics theory to improve UVD and propose DVD.

Calculation of dominance degree between objects
As for the calculation of dominance degree between objects, the basic idea is to take the frequency of the criterion value in data sets as its approximate probability, and then the approximate probability distribution of the criterion values is obtained. On this basis, the dominance degree between objects can be calculated.

For an IODS < U, C ∪ D > and ∀a ∈ C, let kia = |{x ∈ U: a(x)  = ai}| for each ai ∈ Va. maxVa and minVa respectively denote the best value and the worst value of all known values in Va. From Bernoulli’s law of large numbers in probability theory, the probability of a(x)  = ai for object x on criterion a is about

P{a(x)=ai}=kiak1a+k2a+⋯+k|Va|a=kia∑|Va|j=1kja
Thus, (9) can be improved as

IP≥{a}(x,y)=⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪01∑ai∈Va,ai≥a(y)kia∑|Va|j=1kja∑ai∈Va,a(x)≥aikia∑|Va|j=1kja∑|Va|i=1(kia×∑al∈Va,al≥aikla)(∑|Va|j=1kja)2a(x)≠∗∧a(y)≠∗∧¬(a(x)≥a(y))a(x)=maxVa∨a(y)=minVa∨(a(x)≠∗∧a(y)≠∗∧a(x)≥a(y))a(x)=∗∧a(y)≠∗∧a(y)≠minVaa(x)≠∗∧a(x)≠maxVa∧a(y)=∗a(x)=∗∧a(y)=∗
(10)
In (10), when a(x) = * and a(y) = *, the derivation process of IP≥{a}(x,y) is as follows:

IP≥{a}(x,y)======P{a(x)≥a(y)}∑|Va|i=1P{a(x)≥a(y)|a(y)=ai}P{a(y)=ai}∑|Va|i=1(∑al∈Va,al≥aiP{a(x)=al|a(y)=ai})P{a(y)=ai}∑|Va|i=1⎛⎝∑al∈Va,al≥aikla∑|Va|j=1kja⎞⎠kia∑|Va|j=1kja∑|Va|i=1kia∑al∈Va,al≥aikla(∑|Va|j=1kja)2∑|Va|i=1(kia∑al∈Va,al≥aikla)(∑|Va|j=1kja)2
Further, the definition (8) is improved as

IP≥A(x,y)={1∏a∈AIP≥{a}(x,y)x=yx≠y
(11)
The definitions (10)–(11) are objective because they do not rely on any prior knowledge except the data set. Moreover, this method is more effective and reasonable for big data sets.

Example 2
In Table 1, according to (10) and (11), the dominance degree between objects can be calculated and shown in Table 2.

Table 2 Dominance degree between objects calculated from Table 1
Full size table
Now, we consider two objects x2 and x4 in Table 1. Let C1  = {c1, c2, c3} and C2  = {c2, c3, c4}. According to definitions (10) and (11), we have that

IP≥C1(x4,x2)=38×56×1=516,IP≥C2(x4,x2)=56×1×1=56,IP≥C(x4,x2)=38×56×1×1=516
And then, there are IP≥C(x4,x2)=IP≥C1(x4,x2) and IP≥C(x4,x2)<IP≥C2(x4,x2). That’s to say, for any x, y ∈ U, if B ⊂ A, then there is IP≥A(x, y) ≤ IP≥B(x, y) because the probability IP≥{a}(x, y) ∈ [0,1] of x dominating y on any a ∈ C. This implies that IP≥A(x,y) decreases monotonically with the increase of criterion set.

In addition, it is worth noting that when the number of objects in the given data set is relatively small, it is not reliable to take the frequency of criterion value in this data set as its approximate probability. In this case, the reliability of dominance degree between objects calculated by definitions (10)–(11) is weakened. Therefore, the calculating method of dominance degree between objects proposed in this paper is more effective for big data sets with a large quantity of objects.

Automatic threshold selection method
In valued dominance relation, if the threshold α is too large, there are too few objects in many objects’ dominating set and dominated set; otherwise, there are too many objects in many objects’ dominating set and dominated set. In fact, the size of the threshold α reflects the differentiation strength of dominance relation between objects. Therefore, the threshold α should not be too large or too small. Considering that the constraints of TD are relatively loose, and it has a strong inclusiveness. Therefore, by using the dominance degree between objects in tolerance dominating set and tolerance dominated set, an appropriate threshold α may be constructed to distinguish the objects in IODS. The construction method is as follows.

For an IODS < U,C ∪ D > and ∀A ⊆ C, the tolerance dominating set TD+A(x)  = {y ∈ U: < y,x >  ∈ TDA}, and the tolerance dominated set TD−A(x)  = {y ∈ U: < x,y >  ∈ TDA} of object x in U. According to definitions (10) and (11), the dominance degree IP≥A(y,x) (IP≥A(x,y)) can be calculated for each y ∈ TD+A(x) (y ∈ TD−A(x)). For the convenience of the following discussion, we first introduce the following notations.

α+max(x)=maxy∈TD+A(x)∧y≠x{IP≥A(y,x)},α+min(x)=miny∈TD+A(x)∧y≠x{IP≥A(y,x)}
(12)
α−max(x)=maxy∈TD−A(x)∧y≠x{IP≥A(x,y)},α−min(x)=miny∈TD−A(x)∧y≠x{IP≥A(x,y)}
(13)
αΔmax=minx∈U{αΔmax(x)},αΔmin=maxx∈U{αΔmin(x)}
(14)
where Δ ∈ {+ , −} and |TDΔA(x)|> 1 means that TDΔA(x) contains other objects except x.

Obviously, the relationship between αΔmax and αΔmin is uncertain. In valued dominance relation, if α = αΔmin, then the dominating (dominated) set of some objects may be too small when αΔmin > αΔmax. If α = αΔmax, then the dominating (dominated) set of some objects may be too small when αΔmin < αΔmax. Therefore, it is unsuitable for α to be αΔmin or αΔmax. Let αΔ = min{αΔmax, αΔmax}. In the same way, it is unsuitable for α to be α+ or α− in some cases. Therefore, a conservative solution is α = min{α+, α−} = min{α+max, α+min, α−max, α−min}.

Example 3
From Example 2, the results in Table 3 can be calculated by using definitions (12)–(14).

Table 3 αΔmax (x) and αΔmin(x) of each object x in U
Full size table
From Table 3, we have α+max = 0.833, α+min = 0.250, α−max = 0.143 and α−min  = 0.833, the valued dominating (dominated) sets of each object in U will be small. However, if α  = 0.143, then it will be greatly improved.

Therefore, the threshold α in valued dominance relation is calculated as

α+max(x)=maxy∈TD+A(x)∧y≠x{IP≥A(y,x)}α+min(x)=miny∈TD+A(x)∧y≠x{IP≥A(y,x)}⎫⎭⎬⎪⎪⎪⎪⇒α+max=minx∈U{α+max(x)}α+min=maxx∈U{α+min(x)}α−max(x)=maxy∈TD−A(x)∧y≠x{IP≥A(x,y)}α−min(x)=miny∈TD−A(x)∧y≠x{IP≥A(x,y)}⎫⎭⎬⎪⎪⎪⎪⇒α−max=minx∈U{α−max(x)}α−min=maxx∈U{α−min(x)}⎫⎭⎬⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⇒α=min{α+max,α+min,α−max,α−min}
To sum up, we get the automatic selection method of the threshold in valued dominance relation as shown in Algorithm 1.

Definition of DVD
On the basis of Sect. 3.1 and 3.2, the DVD is defined as

DVDαA={<x,y>∈U2:IP≥A(x,y)≥α},
(15)
where the dominance degree IP≥A (x,y) of x dominating y on A ⊆ C is defined by (10) and (11), and the threshold α ∈ (0,1] is calculated by Algorithm 1.

According to (10), (11) and (15), it is clear that DVD is reflexive only. According to Ref. [7], the lower approximation DVDαA–––––––(Cl≥t) (DVDαA–––––––(Cl≤t)) and upper approximation DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl≥t) (DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl≤t)) of Cl≥t (Cl≤t) with respect to A ⊆ C are defined as

DVDαA–––––––(Cl≥t)={x∈U:DVDα,+A(x)⊆Cl≥t},DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl≥t)=∪x∈Cl≥tDVDα,+A(x)
(16)
DVDαA–––––––(Cl≤t)={x∈U:DVDα,−A(x)⊆Cl≤t},DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl≤t)=∪x∈Cl≤tDVDα,−A(x),
(17)
where t  = 1,2,…,n,DVDα,+A(x) = {y ∈ U: < y,x >  ∈ DVDαA} and DVDα,−A(x) = {y ∈ U: < x,y >  ∈ DVDαA} are the valued dominating set and the valued dominated set of object x, respectively.

The following properties 1 and 2 give the relations among TD, SD, LD, and DVD.

Property 1
For an IODS < U, C ∪ D > and A ⊆ C, there are SDA ⊆ LDA ⊆ TDA and DVDαA ⊆ TDA, but there is no definite inclusion relation between LDA and DVDαA, SDA and DVDαA

Proof
Firstly, SDA ⊆ LDA ⊆ TDA is obvious due to definitions (4)–(6).

Secondly, we prove that DVDαA ⊆ TDA. Since {a ∈ A: a(x) ≠ *} ≠ ∅ for ∀x ∈ U, there is

∀<x,y>∈DVDαA⇔<x,y>∈U2∧(IP≥A(x,y)≥α)⇔<x,y>∈U2∧(∏a∈AIP≥{a}(x,y)≥α∨x=y)⇒<x,y>∈U2∧(∏a∈AIP≥{a}(x,y)>0∨x=y)⇔<x,y>∈U2∧(∀a∈A(a(x)=∗∨a(y)=∗∨a(x)≥a(y)))⇔<x,y>∈TDA
Therefore, DVDαA ⊆ TDA. Moreover, if the threshold α > 0 and small enough in DVDαA, then there is

∏a∈AIP≥{a}(x,y))≥α∨x=y⇔∏a∈AIP≥{a}(x,y))>0∨x=y
At this time, there is DVDαA = TDA, i.e., the DVD is degraded as the TD.

By definitions of SDA, LDA and DVDαA (See (5), (6), and (15)), for ∀ < x,y >  ∈ SDA or ∀ < x,y >  ∈ LDA, there is not necessarily IP≥A(x,y) ≥ α, and vice versa. In Example 1,

<x1,x9>∈LDC,IP≥C(x1,x9)=1×26×68×1=0.25⇒<x1,x9>∉DVDαCfor α>0.25;
<x2,x1>∉LDC,IP≥C(x2,x1)=78×56×68×57≈0.391⇒<x2,x1>∈DVDαC,for α≤0.391;
<x2,x5>∈SDC,IP≥C(x2,x5)=1×23×1×57≈0.476⇒<x2,x5>∉DVDαC,for α>0.476;
<x3,x4>∉SDC,IP≥C(x3,x4)=1×1×1×1=1⇒<x3,x4>∈DVDαC,for any α∈(0,1].
So, there is no definite inclusion relation between LDA and DVDαA, SDA and DVDαA. □

Due to Property 1 and definitions (15)–(17), the following Property 2 can be easily obtained.

Property 2
Considering an IODS < U, C ∪ D > , ∀A ⊆ C and ∀x ∈ U, there is DVDα,ΔA(x) ⊆ TDΔA(x), but there is no definite inclusion relation between SDΔA(x) and DVDα,ΔA(x), LDΔA(x) and DVDα,ΔA(x), here Δ ∈ {+ , −}.

Next, let's discuss the typical rough set properties of DVD.

Property 3
Considering an IODS < U,C ∪ D > and ∀B ⊂ A ⊆ C. Let # ∈ {≥ , ≤}, Δ ∈ {+ , −}, t  = 1,2,…, n, then we have the following results:

Rough inclusion: DVDαA–––––––(Cl#t)⊆Cl#t⊆DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl#t).

Complementarity: DVDαA–––––––(Cl#t)=U−DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(U−Cl#t).

Monotonicity with respect to growing set of criteria: DVDαA ⊆ DVDαB, DVDα,ΔA(x) ⊆ DVDα,ΔB (x), DVDαB–––––––(Cl#t)⊆DVDαA–––––––(Cl#t) and DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl#t)⊆DVDαB¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl#t)

Monotonicity with respect to growing union of classes: DVDαA–––––––(X)⊆DVDαA–––––––(Y), DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(X)⊆DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Y), for any X ⊆ Y ⊆ U.

● Monotonicity with respect to super-union of classes:

DVDαA–––––––(Cl≥s)⊇DVDαA–––––––(Cl≥t),DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl≥s)⊇DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl≥t),where 1≤s<t≤n
DVDαA–––––––(Cl≤s)⊆DVDαA–––––––(Cl≤t),DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl≤s)⊆DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl≤t),where 1≤s<t≤n
Proof
Due to definition (16) and the reflexivity of DVD, DVDαA–––––––(Cl#t)⊆Cl#t⊆DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl#t) is obvious.

We first prove that DVDαA–––––––(Cl≥t)=U−DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(U−Cl≥t). By the rough inclusion, for ∀z∈DVDαA–––––––(Cl≥t), there is z ∈ Cl≥t. For ∀y ∈ U-Cl≥t = Cl≤t−1, then there is z ∉ DVDα,−A(y) (If not, there is y ∈ DVDα,+A(z), and then y ∈ Cl≥t. This is contrary to y ∈ Cl≤t−1), i.e., z∉DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl≤t−1). This implies that z∈U−DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl≤t−1), i.e., DVDαA–––––––(Cl≥t)⊆U−DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl≤t−1). Similarly, it can be proved that U−DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl≤t−1)⊆DVDαA–––––––(Cl≥t). So, we have DVDαA–––––––(Cl≥t)=U−DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(U−Cl≥t).

In the same way, we have DVDαA–––––––(Cl≤t)=U−DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(U−Cl≤t).

By the definitions (10)–(11) of IP≥A(x,y), there is IP≥B(x,y) ≥ IP≥A(x,y) for any x,y ∈ U and B ⊂ A.

We first prove that DVDαA⊆DVDαB. For ∀<x,y>∈DVDαA, there is IP≥A(x,y)≥α, and then IP≥B(x,y)≥α. This implies that <x,y>∈DVDαB. So, DVDαA⊆DVDαB is true.

We prove DVDα,ΔA(x)⊆DVDα,ΔB(x). For ∀y∈DVDα,+A(x), there is <y,x>∈DVDαA, and then <y,x>∈DVDαB. This implies that y∈DVDα,+B(x). So, DVDα,+A(x)⊆DVDα,+B(x) is true. Similarly, DVDα,−A(x)⊆ DVDα,−B(x).

We prove DVDαB–––––––(Cl#t)⊆DVDαA–––––––(Cl#t). For ∀z∈DVDαB–––––––(Cl≥t), there is DVDα,+B(z) ⊆  Cl≥t. Since DVDα,+A (z) ⊆  DVDα,+B(z), there is DVDα,+A(z) ⊆ Cl≥t .This implies that z∈DVDαA–––––––(Cl≥t). So,DVDαB–––––––(Cl≥t)⊆DVDαA–––––––(Cl≥t) is true. Similarly, DVDαB–––––––(Cl≤t)⊆DVDαA–––––––(Cl≤t).

The proof of DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl#t)⊆DVDαB¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl#t) is similar to that of DVDαB–––––––(Cl#t)⊆DVDαA–––––––(Cl#t).

We first prove that DVDαA–––––––(X)⊆DVDαA–––––––(Y). By the definitions (16)-(17), for any x∈DVDαA–––––––(X), there is DVDα,ΔA(x) ⊆ X. Since X ⊆ Y, there is DVDα,ΔA(x) ⊆ Y. This implies that x∈DVDαA–––––––(Y). So, there is DVDαA–––––––(X)⊆DVDαA–––––––(Y). Similarly, we can prove that DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(X)⊆DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Y).

We first prove DVDαA–––––––(Cl≥s)⊇DVDαA–––––––(Cl≥t) for 1 ≤ s < t ≤ n. Let x∈DVDαA–––––––(Cl≥t), then there is DVDα,+A(x) ⊆ Cl≥t. Since s < t is equivalent to Cl≥t ⊆ Cl≥s, there is DVDα,+A(x) ⊆ Cl≥s. This implies that x∈DVDαA–––––––(Cl≥s). So, there is DVDαA–––––––(Cl≥s)⊇DVDαA–––––––(Cl≥t).

Now, we prove that DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl≥s)⊇DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl≥t) for 1 ≤ s < t ≤ n. Let y∈DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl≥t), then there exists z ∈   Cl≥t such that y ∈ DVDα,+A(z). Since s < t is equivalent to Cl≥t ⊆ Cl≥s, there is z ∈ Cl≥s and y ∈ DVDα,+A(z). This implies that y∈DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl≥s). So, there is DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl≥s)⊇DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl≥t).

Similarly, we can prove that DVDαA–––––––(Cl≤s)⊆DVDαA–––––––(Cl≤t) and DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl≤s)⊆DVDαA¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(Cl≤t) for 1 ≤ s < t ≤ n.□

Note that the last three properties in Property 3 (monotonicity with respect to growing set of criteria, monotonicity with respect to growing union of classes, and monotonicity with respect to super-union of classes) correspond to the monotonicity properties (M1), (M2) and (M3) introduced in [1]. In addition, because DVD has no transitivity, the monotonicity with respect to dominance relation does not hold. From Property 3, rough inclusion of approximation, complementarity of upward/downward union sets, monotonicity of approximation with respect to growing set of criteria, and monotonicity of approximation with respect to growing union set (super-union sets), are held in the proposed dominance-based rough set approach employing DVD. These typical rough set properties are consistent with that of dominance-based rough set approach employing classical dominance relation in CODS. This is helpful concerning the design of knowledge reduction algorithms for IODS.

Experimental analysis
Three datasets shown in Table 4 are collected from the UCI (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html). They are CODSs, so we modify them by randomly choosing unknown values according to a given default rate (ranging from 0 to 30% with the step 5%), and then eighteen IODSs are obtained. Secondly, these IODSs are used to test the effectiveness of generalized dominance relations (i.e., TD, SD, LD, UVD, and DVD) in dealing with incomplete information. In addition, in order to evaluate the generalized dominance relation’s ability to process incomplete information, the classification ability and the approximation quality of generalized dominance relation is compared with that of classical dominance relation.

Definition 3
An IODS S2 is obtained by randomly selecting unknown values from CODS S1 according to the given default rate. The classification ability μR of generalized dominance relation relative to classical dominance relation is defined as

μR=1|U|∑x∈U|(D+A(x)∩R+(x))∪(D−A(x)∩R−(x))||D+A(x)∪R+(x)∪D−A(x)∪R−(x)|.
(18)
And the approximation quality γR of the partition CL under generalized dominance relation is denoted as

γR(CL)=|U−∪nt=1(BndR(Cl≥t)∪BndR(Cl≤t))||U|,
(19)
where A ⊆ C, D+A(x) and D−A(x) are the dominating set and dominated set of x relative to DA in S1 respectively, while R+(x) and R−(x) are the generalized dominating set and dominated set of x relative to R ∈ {TDA, SDA, LDA, UVDαA,DVDαA} in S2 respectively, and BndR(Cl#t)=R¯¯¯¯(Cl#t)−R––(Cl#t) is the doubtful region of Cl#t (# ∈ {≥ , ≤}).

μR ∈ [0,1] is the ratio of objects classified by generalized dominance relation R relative to classical dominance relation. Moreover, the greater μR is, the better the classification effect of R is. And the approximation quality γR ∈ [0,1] of the partition CL is the proportion of objects that can be correctly classified by the dominance relation R in U.

The classification ability μR and the approximation quality γR of generalized dominance relation relative to classical dominance relation are listed in Table 5. The threshold α in UVD and DVD is calculated by Algorithm 1. From Table 5, on one hand, the classification ability of DVD is higher than that of TD, SD and LD on all data sets and is slightly lower than that of UVD on Car Evaluation-10% and Letter Recognition − 15%. On the other hand, the approximation quality of DVD is higher than that of other generalized dominance relations on all data sets except Chess-5% and Letter Recognition-5%. In addition, with the increase of data set incompleteness, the classification ability and the approximation quality of TD, SD, LD decreases rapidly, while that of DVD is relatively stable. In addition, on three CODSs (Car Evaluation-0%, Chess-0% and Letter Recognition-0%), the results of all generalized dominance relations are consistent with those of classical dominance relations, and this is consistent with the theoretical significance of generalized dominance relation.

To test the effectiveness of the automatic threshold selection method (i.e., Algorithm 1), the classification ability of DVD with different thresholds relative to classical dominance relation is calculated, and are listed in Table 6. The classification ability of DVD is related to its threshold α. Sometimes the classification ability of subjective threshold selection method is even slightly higher than that of Algorithm 1. However, the subjective threshold selection method is uncertain. Therefore, the automatic threshold selection method introduced in this paper is effective.

Conclusions
How to deal with the missing data is a very difficult problem in data mining. Many extensions of rough set theory have been proposed. We study the dominance-based rough set approach based on data-driven in this paper. The relations among these typical extensions are first presented. After analyzing the shortcomings of several typical generalized dominance relations (i.e., TD, SD, LD, and UVD), a new generalized dominance relation called DVD is proposed. On the one hand, it considers the possibility that the objects satisfy the dominance relation on each criterion, and calculates the dominance degree between objects by using the frequency of criterion values in data sets. This method is especially effective for big data sets with a large quantity of objects. On the other hand, an automatic threshold selection algorithm is proposed, which is an objective method. Therefore, our method is an improvement on the existing method. Experimental analysis shows that the classification results of DVD are better and more stable than that of other generalized dominance relations. In the future, the knowledge reduction algorithm based on DVD in IODS will be designed, and its effectiveness will be tested.

It is worth noting that the automatic threshold selection method (i.e., Algorithm 1) is a compromise objective method when prior information is insufficient. So, in some specific cases, it may lead to more inconsistencies. At this point, it is a desirable strategy to make full use of prior information to set the threshold. In addition, it is a good method to set the threshold with the goal of minimizing the inconsistency of IODS. But, this method will lead to a large amount of computation. In fact, the selection of an appropriate threshold is always an open issue to be further analyzed and studied. The automatic threshold selection method proposed in this paper is an attempt of this work.
