Smart classrooms are paradigm innovations for enhanced learning behavior in digital learning environments. These environments offer benefits for inclusive and virtual learning, underscoring the need for assessments of current practices. Although research on smart classrooms propose models and systems for enhancing socio-technological integration, knowledge on socio-technological challenges of smart classrooms remains limited. This article applies a systematic review methodology in line with the PRISMA protocol and analyzes current social and technological challenges based on 105 articles published between 2000 and 2019. The review identifies social challenges that facilitate personalization for external factors and teaching methods, stimulate learner-oriented content, instructor, peer, and technology forms of engagement, and boost interactivity depending on the willingness of learners and instructors. The review also finds technological challenges that concern designing learning environments and integrating intelligent systems, analytical tools and analysis, system models and ontology, and mobile and social media applications. The review suggests areas for future research involving smart classroom design for continuity and consistency, quality attributes of smart classrooms, efficiency and sustainability of smart classroom infrastructure, and the development of a smart classroom modelling language.

Socio-technological challenges

Technology-supported learning

1. Introduction
Everyday life remains progressively digitized and interconnected in terms of information and technology use, triggering an evolution in learning behavior. Noticeably, digital natives increasingly turn towards digital devices to enhance their learning (Barak, 2018), as older forms of communication become more marginalized in favor of smart technologies. While online and offline environments have for the most part evolved in leaps and bounds, the classroom is still a relatively traditionally configured space that is limited in reflecting the evolution of society and culture. In response to this limitation, educators underscore trends towards ‘smart classrooms’ as socio-technological solutions (Uskov, Bakken, & Pandey, 2015, pp. 3–14) for addressing the evolving needs of learners and teachers. Smart classrooms are modern learning environments that integrate and use emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), wireless networks, mobile technology, and cloud computing (Huang, Su, & Pao, 2019). Yet, literature lacks a review that systematically analyzes the existing social and technological challenges of smart classrooms. This paucity is the motivation for this article.

This article analyses the state-of-the-art of literature on smart classrooms. The aim is to investigate social and technological challenges of smart classroom research using a systematic approach, and to analyze research efforts aimed at confronting these challenges with a view to setting a research agenda for future studies. Although recent reviews of smart learning environments address problems such as technology evaluation (Lai & Bower, 2019), student engagement (Schindler, Burkholder, Morad, & Marsh, 2017), technology-supported peer assessment (Fu, Lin, & Hwang, 2019), and the use of smart boards (Mun & Abdullah, 2016, pp. 120–125), literature is limited in capturing and presenting the range of underpinning socio-technological challenges of smart classrooms. Accordingly, this review seeks to capture the range of socio-technological factors that researchers (e.g., Yang, Pan, Zhou, and Huang (2018), Cebrián, Palau, and Mogas (2020), and Takawale and Kulkarni (2016)) consider significant for determining learning paths and fostering equal opportunity within smart classrooms. These factors relate to the assumptions that technology use creates opportunities to support individual and collaborative learning, and the notion that identifying socio-technological challenges facing smart classrooms is vital to realizing the potential of smart classrooms, serves as the main premise for this review.

Theoretically, this review contributes to and advances knowledge regarding smart classroom systems in two ways. First, the review shed light on the technological imperatives of smart classrooms, which offer support for the effective display of teaching content, streamlined management of classrooms, and convenient access of learning resources (Aguilar, Valdiviezo, Cordero, & Sánchez, 2015, pp. 471–477; Yang et al., 2018). Furthermore, there is evidence that smart classrooms, based on well-researched principles, could facilitate easy transitions to distance and virtual learning (Munawar, Toor, Aslam, & Hamid, 2018). Rapid developments in virtual technologies with prospects for virtual learning continue to show immense potential for future growth (Lee, Lee, & Park, 2013), further underscoring the importance of this smart classroom review. Second, the social dimensions of this study add to the discourse on inclusive and supportive learning, which seeks to incorporate diverse learners with different educational needs (Chaudhary, Agrawal, & Jharia, 2014; Kim, Soyata, & Behnagh, 2018). In this context, the application of smart classroom technology and its integration with digital learning platforms promises a high degree of adaptation and improvements in the educational experience for those with varied educational needs (Bakken, Uskov, Penumatsa, & Doddapaneni, 2016, pp. 15–27; Uskov et al., 2015, pp. 3–14). The suggestion is that educators could harness insights from the review on complexities associated with the social interaction and technology applications for enhanced management of technology and inclusivity in education.

Practically, transformational changes towards smart classrooms hinge on readiness assessments that facilitate effective technology use and this review fills gaps in knowledge on the main constructs demanded of such changes. In the context of current research addressing readiness through evaluations and assessment of requirements for smart classrooms (Cebrián et al., 2020; Lai & Bower, 2019; MacLeod, Yang, Zhu, & Li, 2018; Mohamed & Lamia, 2018; Zhu, 2020, pp. 363–369), this review sheds the spotlight on existing measures needed to counter challenges identified in previous studies. Furthermore, smart classrooms as learning environments add value to education by affording learners with personalized, intelligent, and adaptive learning settings. These learning environments aid in reducing the cognitive load of students, and enhancing ontological construction and sense making among learners (Al-Qirim, 2011). Additionally, emerging gaps in existing literature could serve as the basis for improving prompt decision making and learning in flexible and technology-supported interactive environments (Mohamed & Lamia, 2018; Zhu, 2020, pp. 363–369). Although evidence in favor of the teaching and learning benefits of smart classrooms is overwhelmingly positive, studies such as Ekşi and Yeşilyurt (2018) show that several schools lack these capabilities due to limited funds and investment. Consequently, there is a need to uncover opportunities for more economical designs for smart classrooms. This is because technology-inspired reconfiguration of schools and classrooms is inevitable, and educators will have to confront new challenges that accompany the ubiquitous use of mobile devices and continued growth and evolution of the smart classroom concept.

For this review, the interest is on identifying social and technological challenges associated with smart classrooms through analyzing the objectives, methodologies, theories, and domains of existing research on smart classrooms. Using insights from the review, this article also intends to shed light on potential future trends for multi-disciplinary and multi-faceted development of smart classrooms. The intention is to advance the field by uncovering new areas for future research. Thus, the research questions guiding this review are:

RQ1

What social challenges influence how smart classrooms are developed?

RQ2

How do smart classroom studies address technological challenges between learners and instructors?

The remainder of the review proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a definition of smart classroom; Section 3 introduces the review methodology while Section 4 Findings on technological challenges for smart classrooms, 5 Summary of socio-technological challenges for smart classroom research identify the factors of the smart classroom both social and technological. Section 6 outlines some possible ideas for future research on smart classrooms.

1.1. Smart classrooms: A definition
Due to increasing sophistication of learning environments, the definition of a smart classroom has evolved over time in the literature. For a start, Uskov et al. (2015, pp. 3–14) note that the definition had its first phase between 2001 and 2007, and essentially involved delineating smart classrooms as traditional face-to-face learning with technological enhancements of the Internet and a central viewing screen. The second phase, i.e., 2008 to the current time, incorporates mobile devices and analytics for more interactive classroom styles. Aguilar et al. (2018; p. 693) provide an inclusive definition that reflects this phase suggesting that smart classrooms take advantage of “different technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), ubiquitous, and cloud paradigms, among others, in order to improve the learning process”. Although varied definitions exist for smart classrooms (Abdel-Basset, 2019; Mathioudakis et al., 2014), there is a scholarly consensus that modern smart classrooms are managed digital environments where numerous tasks (e.g., teaching, discussion, and evaluation) can take place, assisted (and never hindered) by technology for seamless learning experiences (Yang, 2015).

Underpinning several definitions for smart classrooms are technical and technology-based conceptualizations proposed within studies. For instance, Kalaiselvi and Jayashri (2017) consider smart classrooms as a technology-supported learning environment, Radosavljevic, Radosavljevic, and Jelic (2019) emphasize the use of an intelligent environment, and Zheng, Yang, Feng, Fu, and Shi (2019) posit on the incorporation and integration of intelligent teaching, learning, and living environments. Li, Yang, and MacLeod (2018), Aguilar, Buendia, Pinto, and Gutiérrez (2019), Krummheuer, Rehm, Lund, and Nielsen (2018), Oommen (2012), Cho, Park, Nam, Ahn, and Lee (2012), Mir and Abdou (2005), and Thomas, Parsons, and Whitcombe (2018) consider smart classrooms as formed based on the technical incorporation of any kind of technology in the learning process. Similarly, MacLeod et al. (2018) and Pingxiao (2017) specify smart classrooms as physical classrooms integrating educational technologies that increase instructors' ability to facilitate students’ learning. Examples of educational technologies include computers, screens, laptop connectors, specialized software, assistive devices, IoT, and context-aware computing (Huang et al., 2019; Mendini & Peter, 2018; Temkar et al., 2016). There are also technical specifications to include 3G and 4G for a classroom to be considered smart (Alelaiwi et al., 2015), which support the depiction of smart classrooms as complete technical systems that utilize intelligent equipment, situational awareness technology, high-speed mobile Internet, and monitoring facilities of energy network for enhancing overall campus security (Zheng et al., 2019). These viewpoints suggest that the presence of technology is a constant tenet in most definitions, with focus on users such as instructors and learners.

Another factor in conceptualizing and defining smart classrooms is the vital role of technological advances. Original conceptualizations of smart classrooms tended to focus on interactive whiteboards as centerpieces for smart classrooms (Blau, 2011; Yildirim, 2016). However, this idea has evolved vastly to consider connectivity between devices (Timms, 2016) and collaboration between learners (Lui, Tissenbaum, & Slotta, 2011). These changing potentials serve as the impetus for educators portraying and arguing for the smart classroom as a fulcrum for distance learning, something truly relevant in the era of online learning (Pishva & Nishantha, 2008). For some educators (Augusto, 2009; Bakken et al., 2016, pp. 15–27), the focus is on analytics and smart objects such as those involved in ambient intelligence, as learning enhancing parameters. Other scholars highlight smart classroom as a conceptual learning environment rather than the mere physical space. This focus offers prospects for scalable learning in a space that “employs learning analytic techniques to allow students’ physical interactions and spatial positioning” (Slotta, Tissenbaum, & Lui, 2013, pp. 270–274, p. 271). For some authors such as Lui et al. (2011), the focus is on spaces that are inherently collaborative, and the concept of smart classroom entails “new forms of learning, where students collaborate within their classroom or across multiple classrooms” (p. 430). Thus, the connectivity attributed to technological advancements creates opportunities for smart classroom to enrich teaching and learning. Furthermore, evidence suggests that technological advances for smart classrooms continue to attract the attention of researchers with evidence suggesting exponential increases in related-research publications, as shown by Fig. 1. This trend mirrors insights suggesting positive links between smart classroom use and improved outcomes (Lui et al., 2011, Lui and Slotta, 2013; Sevindik, 2010), positive attitudes (Oommen, 2012; Young, 2009), inquiry designs (Slotta et al., 2013, pp. 270–274) and information clarity (Davidovitch & Yavich, 2017) for learners. Others such as Yang et al. (2018) and Naidu, Singh, Hasan, and Hadrami (2017) suggest smart classrooms offer notable benefits to learners over traditional, non-digitized classrooms. These generally positive results stem from current technological classroom investment, which is expected to still rise in the future.

Literature also contains social- and pedagogical-based conceptualizations for smart classrooms. For instance, Li et al. (2018) posit on smart classrooms as a way of improving learners' socialization and achievement. Dai (2019) proposes the utilization of optimal knowledge attained through teaching content, convenient acquisition of learning resources, and deep interaction during classroom teaching, Di, Danxia, and Chun (2019) consider smart classrooms as avenues for enhanced higher-order thinking, while Li, Yang, MacLeod, and Dai (2019) suggest that smart classrooms offer paths for increasing active learning processes while emphasizing flexibility for different types of instructional delivery. Bautista and Borges (2013) present a socio-technological imperative for smart classrooms as environments that facilitate “collaborative learning, project-based learning, curricular globalization, students’ autonomy, and educational co-responsibility” (p. 19). Other framings rooted in social and pedagogical considerations include support for interactive content and suggestions (Temdee, 2019), and learning experiences in social constructs (Papadakis, Tsalera, & Samarakou, 2019).

Considering these different existing technological, technical, analytical, interactive, social, and pedagogical conceptualizations, this review puts forward the following definition:

A smart classroom is a learning environment that technically integrates intelligent technologies and analytically facilitates collaborative spaces for socially enhanced learning pedagogies and higher-order thinking to optimize content presentation, convenient access of learning resources, interactivity of teaching and learning, and classroom layout and management.

Informed by the proposed definition, this review highlights socio-technological aspects of smart classrooms that facilitate their effective use and practice. The focus of this review is on smart classroom as a learning space that is growing every day in relevance and importance in the ambit of education (Li, Feng, Zhou, & Shi, 2009). This space incorporates smart devices, data analysis, and modeling with the integration of data across platforms and devices, and with prospects for creative and innovative learning behavior. Thus, the rationale for this review is that a future research agenda drawing on current socio-technological challenges in research can contribute to a better technological, technical, analytical, interactive, social, and pedagogical understanding of smart classrooms as learning spaces.

2. Methodology
This article adopts a systematic review methodology (Randolph, 2009) that involves formulating specific questions and stages of identification, selection, and critical appraisal of available research studies. Thus, systematic reviews prioritize equality, coverage, and accessibility when conducting data analyses, over multiple grey literature, and databases, to ensure the reproducibility and replicability of results in subsequent studies. Accordingly, systematic reviews require well-thought-out strategies for searching relevant data sources with primary foci on defining and answering the research questions. Ultimately, the researcher identifies various forms of information for eventual critique within a defined framework (Grant & Booth, 2009). Thus, research strategies, review terms, and limitations are central to the systematic literature review.

Adopting a defined plan or protocol is a key feature of the systematic review methodology (Pittway, 2007), and this review applies the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol (Moher et al., 2015; Shamseer et al., 2015), which provides guidelines for reporting systematic reviews. Appendix I shows the PRISMA checklist for the review containing 10 unchanged items, 6 added items, 1 modified item, and 9 omitted items. This review involves three phases: selection, evaluation, and synthesis. Studies (e.g., Scott et al. (2019)) show that these main phases follow the identification of study objectives and questions, and that the methodical nature of these stages is in keeping with the systematic review methodology (Pittway, 2007; Randolph, 2009). This systematic approach was necessary for synthesizing the existing evidence on the socio-technological aspects of smart classrooms. The systematic review process as shown by Fig. 2 focuses the review on theoretical and empirical research articles on smart classrooms and smart learning environment. Following these phases, the researcher sifts through the literature before appraising and combining the findings reported by previous researchers (Foltýnek, Meuschke, & Gipp, 2019).

2.1. Selection phase
The selection phase involves formulating keywords depending on the topic of interest. This phase involves interchanging words to expand the search base for the topic as noted by Dewett and Jones (2001). The keywords for this systematic review are, “smart classroom”, “smart class room”, and “smart learning environment”. These keywords represent the main terms applicable in this study. This phase adopts Scopus, a widely accepted search engine database (accessible at www.scopus.com) and applies the previously formulated search strings as keywords to search for and identify sources.

2.2. Evaluation phase
The evaluation phase entails screening returned results for context and relevance. Screening and selection for the review focuses on peer-reviewed journal publications in line with related reviews and content related to the topic of interest. Inclusion criteria was set as a peer-reviewed article in the English language published from January 2000 to December 2019. The evaluation also ensures the included studies are relevant to the search terms and study context. The exclusion criteria apply to studies in journal articles that do not involve smart classroom research explicitly e.g., studies that mention smart classrooms as a side topic and those that do not discuss or explore details of smart classrooms. This phase also excludes studies failing to meet the set inclusion criteria. Due to the scope, the review excludes opinion pieces, commentaries, editorials, discussions, papers, and presentations without associated papers.

Screening of titles, abstracts, and contents enable this phase to refine and reduce the results from 1328 to 105 articles. Main publication outlets contained in the review include Computers & Education, Computers in Human Behavior, Interactive Learning Environments, IEEE Access, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, Telematics and Informatics, IEEE Pervasive Computing, and Instructional Science. Methodologies in the sources, as shown in Table 1, include surveys, case studies, system analysis, multi-methodologies, and other studies such as experimentations and co-design methods.

2.3. Synthesis phase
The synthesis phase involves analyzing the 105 selected sources to extract relevant information concerning smart classrooms. For the analysis, the interest was specifically on socio-technological challenges and the contexts for these challenges within studies, in line with the research questions. Here, the process involved examining the different aspects of the gathered studies such as the study design, smart classroom terms used, the timing of data collection, theory, intervention type, intervention recipient, and target outcomes. The motivation for the analysis was to offer contexts for the identified themes and to understand the scope of current research. For the synthesis phase, the review mainly applies thematic analysis to evaluate, classify, and outline themes in the journal articles. Using thematic analysis as part of the systematic review methodology enables researchers to discover information from qualitative data (Clarke & Braun, 2016) and to develop deep understanding and insights into the gathered data. Insights from the gathered data inform interpretations and investigators tend to correlate the frequency of a theme within a spectrum of content. This form of analysis typically exhibits a substantial degree of intricacy and accuracy, which helps to ameliorate meaning for a research (Guest, MacQueen, & Namey, 2012, pp. 3–20). The thematic analysis for this review entails data reduction in three distinct steps (Guest et al., 2012; Nowell, Norris, White, & Moules, 2017): (i) reading the data repeatedly (twice for this review) for preparedness to identify possible themes within the document and for familiarity with the data to gain deeper understanding of content (performed by the corresponding author), (ii) generating initial codes that reflect concepts related to the study questions (reviewed and done by the co-authors), and (iii) creating the themes through marking different and relevant sentences along with rereading content to confirm and contrast different themes (done by co-authors).

An assessment of the reliability and validity of developed themes (Herzog, Handke, & Hitters, 2019) follows the data reduction steps and a fellow researcher was co-opted to help in reviewing the documents and comparing the developed themes. Using the reduction and assessment steps, the synthesis phase clusters and outlines the findings into social and technological challenges, followed by discussions on a set of recommendations for future research.

The evaluation phase also considers threats to internal validity i.e., the degree to which the design and execution of the study prevents systematic errors. For this review, specifying inclusion and exclusion criteria a priori assists in mitigating the threat. Here, threats exist due to the unique definition adopted for smart classroom, which influences the perspective for the study and the timeframe of the review, which was limited to the period between 2000 and 2019. However, it is worth noting that within this period, significant changes occurred in the development of smart classrooms. Thus, these studies reflect different experiences, and these differences tend to influence the outcomes of this study. The study also considers external validity mainly concerning the scope of this review, which is restricted to peer-reviewed scientific articles. For this study, the threats involve potential gaps between research findings and recommendations, and possible steps that could provide cues consciously or unconsciously during the selection of studies and influence the outcomes of the review process. Thus, it is vital when interpreting the study findings to acknowledge the potential impacts of these threats to validity. The next section discusses the findings from the articles.

3. Findings on social challenges for smart classrooms
This section presents the main social challenges confronted by smart classroom researchers. The challenges center on themes for personalization, engagement, and interactivity in smart classrooms, as presented in the next subsections.

3.1. Personalization in smart classrooms
Digital technology promotes a new vision for learners based on a more personalized, dynamic, and knowledge-pull model rather than a centralized, one-size-fits-all, knowledge-push model (Gros, 2016). Personalization of smart classroom relates to the automatic structuring of learning paths to meet learners' needs. The rationale behind personalization is to change the traditional approach of teacher-centered teaching into a learner-centered perspective (Qaffas, Kaabi, Shadiev, & Essalmi, 2020). According to Paquette, Mariño, Rogozan, and Léonard (2015), the addition of ‘smartness’ is a precursor to personalization because the integrated intelligent technology updates learner profiles dynamically and recommends resources and activities with features that adapt scenarios to learner profiles.

Personalization studies remain an area for continuous and incremental progress to enhance learning attitudes, teaching methods, and external factors. Research themes concerning personalization for external factors represent efforts to create a convenient, healthy, and safe living environment for teachers and students (Zheng et al., 2019). The interest in this area is three-fold: (i) studies to personalize environmental conditions like temperature and light intensity (Choi & Suk, 2016; Vasanthapriyan & Randima, 2019), (ii) investigations to conserve energy (Thiyagarajan et al., 2018; Vasanthapriyan & Randima, 2019; Zheng et al., 2019), and (iii) research to create authentic and secure environments that promote self-learning and self-accountability (Lee, 2015; Ouf et al., 2016; Sevindik, 2010; Uzelac et al., 2015). These areas of studies for smart classroom changes strive for personalization by prioritizing environmental conditions and making recommendations that improve convenience, health, and safety of teaching and learning environments.

Research on personalization for learning attitudes suggest potential benefits of linking specific learning attitudes, learning motivations, and Internet attitudes directly and indirectly to higher-order thinking skills. These prospects spur researchers to stress self-regulating learning (Munawar et al., 2018) according to personality profiles (e.g., extraversion, openness, and neuroticism) (Tlili et al., 2019) and special needs (Aguilar et al., 2017a, Aguilar et al., 2017b), as part of personalized designs for smart classrooms. Other aspects of personalized learning are based on incorporating concentration levels (Kim, 2018), personalizing activity completion (Anil & Moiz, 2019), assuring fulfilment of the minimal study objectives through appropriate learning paths (Temdee, 2019), and supporting flexibility for e-learning based on users' personal timeframes (Park & Hyun, 2014). However, the premise for personalization varies with arguments for focus on the needs of the students (Allawi et al., 2014), knowledge management suggestions (Kalaiselvi & Jayashri, 2017), digital artifacts based on user profiles (Gaeta et al., 2015), AmI (Leonidis et al., 2010), and context-aware and adaptive preferences (Yau et al., 2002, pp. 233–238). Some proposals for learner-driven personalization include customization of learning schedules (Cheong & Koh, 2018), use of blogs (Aldulaimi et al., 2018), and control of the learning processes that involve selecting teachers, courses, assessment criteria, and use of technology (Kinshuk et al., 2016). These different proposals motivate models for Future Classroom Learning Labs that incorporate a multi-agent infrastructure with a learner-centric focus and support for instructors in adapting and transforming teaching processes according to current and future learning needs (Li et al., 2009; Mathioudakis et al., 2014; Sardinha et al., 2017). Scholars also posit that improvements for personalization depend on transparent sharing of experiences (Terziyan et al., 2014), indicators showing levels of fatigue (Radosavljevic et al., 2019), user's personal performance and interaction (Koulocheri & Xenos, 2019), personalized learning activity cycles (Chatti & Muslim, 2019), insights of student trajectories (Aguilar et al., 2017a, Aguilar et al., 2017b), and personal tutoring requirements (Ojedokun, 2003). These research interests stem from the varied user motivations for participation in smart classrooms and pose challenges for smart classroom designs to support evolving learning attitudes.

Investigations concerning personalization for teaching methods tend to focus on the adoption and implementation of different teaching methods or modes of content delivery. Here, research interests vary with attention devoted to the practical use of technologies such as mobile apps (e.g., Youxuepai (Wang et al. (2019)), multimedia platforms (Chunyan et al., 2014; Pingxiao, 2017), machine-generated feedback (Kim et al., 2018), and storage management systems (Pirahandeh & Kim, 2015). There is also research interest in monitoring systems that track levels of interest and student ratings, with adaptations to teaching modes based on ratings (Gligoric et al., 2015). Conceptually, researcher offer additional suggestions for ontology-based approaches (Miraoui, 2018) and methods driven by prior and previous knowledge (Capuano & Toti, 2018). Researchers within this sub-theme are keen to stress that personalizing teaching methods makes it possible for teachers to harness the strengths and potential of each student (Bose, 2003) and to encourage each student to engage in activities to discover, process, and apply new concepts (Godlewska et al., 2019). Although varied in interests, research efforts within this sub-theme strive to offer alternatives that fulfil learner requirements and needs.

3.2. Engagement in smart classrooms
Engagement in smart classrooms is a social challenge related to the willingness of learners and instructors. This challenge necessities a shift towards active learning (Saraubon, 2019), “doing things” (Godlewska et al., 2019), social and informal teaching (Krummheuer et al., 2018), and free learning projects (Said & Albagory, 2016). Four learner-driven research sub-themes explain progress in this area i.e., content, instructor, peer, and technology forms of engagement. The first sub-theme confronts challenges to engage with learning content through improving the learning rate (Gupta et al., 2019) and enhancing learner contribution (Yu & Qi, 2018). The second sub-theme tackles challenges for learners to engage with instructors in new ways that foster effective and efficient teaching approaches (Alghamdi & Altameem, 2019; Timms, 2016). Engaging other learners through peer-based communication, collaboration, and cooperative learning (Dutta et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; Pingxiao, 2017; Terziyan et al., 2014; Tissenbaum & Slotta, 2019) is the third sub-theme. Here, the emphasis is on peer-to-peer and instructor-to-learner interactions with suggestions for smart classrooms to support the transparent sharing of experiences, harnessing and cultivating soft interpersonal, problem-solving, critical thinking, and decision-making skills. Engaging technological platforms (Wogu et al., 2019) is the fourth sub-theme, with research advocating for the use of intelligent tutoring systems (Lee & Cho, 2013), 3G and 4G technologies (Alelaiwi et al., 2015), and technologies that harness techno-deterministic learning experiences (Väljataga & Mettis, 2018). The expectation being that such technologies provide real-time feedback and immerse learners in interactive learning environments. Evidence from literature suggests that multimedia engagement using videos achieves higher engagement, which in turn increases the motivation to learn among students (Dos Santos, 2019; Snow et al., 2005). Although the research foci vary, the rationale for engagement revolves around higher flexibility, lower cost, and synchronous participation in live digitally supported classes. Thus, technological interventions to promote engagement strive for computational thinking through simulations (Benakli et al., 2016; Lui & Slotta, 2013), modifying attendance systems (Chan et al., 2017), and applying learning analytics (Papadakis et al., 2019). Generally, research that addresses engagement, as a social challenge for smart classrooms, emphasizes the need to understand and deliver designs that consider different interpersonal requirements for communication, collaboration, and cooperative learning.

3.3. Interactivity in smart classrooms
Interactivity enables information flow in smart classrooms and is a social challenge to attract and maintain interests in smart classroom. This challenge prompts experience-based investigations of joyful learning experiences (Kumara et al., 2015), experience exchanges (Al-Qirim, 2011), changing dynamics of student learning patterns (Rajesh & Reena, 2015), student and teacher participation (Cho et al., 2012), teacher-student aptitudes (Zhang, 2016), and student talk and teacher lecture ratios (Jo & Lim, 2015).

Smart technologies enabling interactivity in traditional face-to-face settings involve interactive whiteboard technology (e.g., SMARTBoards) and classroom control software. Additionally, there are technologies that facilitate online interactivity through real-time interactive virtual classrooms (Shi, Xie, Xu, Xiang, & Zhang, 2003; Suo et al., 2009) and interactive network teaching (Zhou, 2016) such as Network Education Ware (Snow et al., 2005). There are also developments for collaborative learning processes (Chamba-Eras & Aguilar, 2017), analytics that harness the prospects of large data sets and complex features (Cheong et al., 2019; Khan et al., 2019). Recognizing the increasing potential and popularity of multimedia user interfaces, researchers of interactivity as a social challenge for smart classrooms, consider constructs that contribute to meaningful experiences of learners by identifying and studying technologies and paradigms for the new levels of instructor-learner interactivity.

4. Findings on technological challenges for smart classrooms
The thematic analysis of the existing literature also reveals five themes that characterize the technological challenges facing smart classroom practice: (i) designing learning environments, (ii) integrating intelligent systems, (iii) proposing system models and ontologies, (iv) applying analytics tools and analysis, and (v) supporting mobile and social media applications.

4.1. Designing learning environments
Designing, prototyping, and implementing learning environments is the main technological challenge for smart classroom research. Studies in this theme tend to focus on providing comprehensive smart systems that support personalized learning, authenticity, and interactivity, and provide further insights on technological affordances to bolster acceptance, implementation, and execution of technology. However, achieving effective designs remains a work in progress, with researchers currently offering design strategies that focus on integration (Peled, 2000), interfacing (Benakli et al., 2016; Cheong & Koh, 2018), smart learning diagnosis (Lin, 2018), and ontology-driven portals for digital ecosystem (Terziyan et al., 2014). Some studies such as Yu and Qi (2018), Dong et al. (2019), Saraubon (2019), Dai (2019), and Al-Qirim (2011), prescribe design strategies for personalized and customized learning environment using smart tools such as the Hydra simulation suite, Audience Response System, beacon technology, fingerprint recognition, smartboards, and whiteboard technologies, Internet-of-Things, and mobile technologies. Other studies propose strategies and guidelines in their redesigns, applications, and evaluations of fully functioning e-learning tools such as WebCT (Ojedokun, 2003), TORM, AMTM, and SameView Software (Shi, Xie, Xu, Xiang, & Zhang, 2003). There are also studies with guidelines based on concepts such as EPUB 3-based Hybrid e-TextBook (Ghaem Sigarchian et al., 2017) and the e-Learning lab (Bose, 2003). Generally, this topical space within the literature, attempts to prescribe guidelines, propose smart tools, and detail functioning e-learning tools for smart classrooms. Inevitably, this design challenge spawns second-order decisiveness challenges involving selection when considering design alternatives, adaptation to specific needs of different learning environments, and innovation with training implications for new tools and technologies.

Another focal point within this theme involves emerging design paradigms for smart classrooms such as Smart Learning Environments (SLEs) (Thomas et al., 2018), Smart Virtual Interactive Environments for Work (SVIEW) (Chauhan et al., 2019), Learning Media Repository and Delivery System (LMRDSs), Network Education Ware (NEW) (Snow et al., 2005) and “eJRM” using knowledge discovery and cognitive computing (Capuano & Toti, 2018). Researchers (e.g., Gaeta et al. (2015) and Li et al. (2019)) argue for the underpinning of these paradigms with rhetorical structure theory to support the integration of learning spaces and the separation of instructional responsibilities for individual needs and cultural contexts. Studies of smart classrooms also suggest expert for user involvement (Godlewska et al., 2019), context-awareness (Temdee, 2019), connectedness (Li et al., 2018) and interactive response (Zhang, 2016). Generally, technological advances in society tend to have corporate origins with prospects for further scientific breakthroughs and commercialization. For educators, the design strategy challenge remains to identify, select, and adapt technologies that suit learning environments. Other considerations in the literature center on incorporating technological and pedagogical models to reflect instructor and learner characteristics.

4.2. Integrating intelligent systems
The next technological challenge involves developing and integrating intelligent systems in smart learning environments. In this theme, the intelligence technologies considered include artificial intelligence (Timms, 2016), ambient intelligence (Leonidis et al., 2010), and IoT and sensor technologies (Vasanthapriyan & Randima, 2019). Other intelligent technologies proposed for smart classrooms include image comparison algorithms (Delfin et al., 2019), streaming servers (Khan et al., 2019), task recognition based on deep learning (Khan et al., 2019) and learner personality modeling (Tlili et al., 2019). Incorporating these forms of intelligence aids in developing emotionally aware classrooms using real-time deep learning-based emotion recognition (Kim, 2018; Kim et al., 2018), context-aware intelligence applying probabilistic logic and web ontologies (Han & Youn, 2013; Qin et al., 2007), and feature extraction that provides information in real-time (Uzelac et al., 2017).

Focusing on these technologies, some studies consider on intelligent automation for managing classrooms. Here, the research interests involve automation of classroom tasks such as completion time of courses (Miraoui, 2018), learning plans (Aguilar et al., 2019), and attendance management (Delfin et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2014), typically using face recognition, NFC, and other functionalities. Recent studies note that achieving high levels of automation increasingly requires IoT integration (Dutta et al., 2018). Closely connected are investigations for environmental intelligence that propose energy and storage management with protocols to shut down automatically for energy conservation (Pirahandeh & Kim, 2015; Zheng et al., 2019), controls for power consumption (Chan et al., 2017; Vasanthapriyan & Randima, 2019), and air conditioning management that set temperatures based on predicted levels of dissatisfaction (Thiyagarajan et al., 2018). Advancements in intelligent systems with potentials for enhanced smart classrooms include the integration of sound-absorbing material (Mir & Abdou, 2005), gestures and body movement (Chunyan et al., 2014; Kumara et al., 2015), activity visualizers (Mathioudakis et al., 2014), and interactive database systems using Autonomous Mobile Robot (AmR) and (Quick Response) QR codes that manage schedules and academic activities (Radosavljevic et al., 2019). The varied focuses in these studies reflect the need for automation support the ambience of classrooms. Recognizing the importance of ambience, a study by Khan et al. (2019) examined learners from different positions under different lighting conditions with cameras and computer system that worked in real-time. Close inspection of the literature suggests support for automation remains the main priority for research involving intelligent systems. The challenge lies in how to ensure intelligent systems lead to learning outcomes.

Security intelligence is another technological challenge within this theme targeting the biometric identification such as fingerprint recognition applying algorithmic authentication mechanism (Chauhan et al., 2019) and facial recognition routines using scale-invariant features (Khan et al., 2019). Secure authentication schemes for cloud computing environments also address sensitivity and privacy concerns for smart learning environments (Lee, 2015). In general, technological challenges for security motivates researchers to highlight data security and protocols for detecting and deterring academic malpractice.

Due to opportunities for multi-level intelligence support, literature contains additional studies of integrated intelligence for smart classrooms. Technological options offered for this challenge entail using Monte Carlo simulations (Cheong et al., 2019), network simulators in remote and virtual labs (Cho et al., 2012; Lui & Slotta, 2013; Said & Albagory, 2016), middleware integration (Sánchez et al., 2018), augmented reality adoption (Chamba-Eras & Aguilar, 2017), and machine learning (Gligoric et al., 2015).

4.3. Proposing system models and ontologies
System models for technologies remain fundamental for smart classrooms and serve as the premise for proposals such as the Intelligent Electronic Laboratory (IE-Laboratory) system (Munawar et al., 2018) and Dynamic Individual Learning Plans (DLPGs) (Anil & Moiz, 2019). Models of these smart classroom systems depend on a confluence of technical, structural, and pedagogical factors. Typically, the extent to which technological artifacts include these factors influences the practical use and management of the smart classroom.

In the literature, there are three main perspectives that propose smart classroom system models. The first perspective considers the architecture for smart classrooms systems. For instance, Dutta et al. (2018) propose an architecture that involves slicing for better understanding the structural data gathered from the application with lower levels of implementation details, and Huang et al. (2019) suggest an architecture for building and running context-aware smart classrooms. Motivated by the need for an architectural framework, Ouf et al. (2016) develop an e-learning ecosystem framework as the basis for personalizing learning objectives. The second perspective ponders stages for smart classroom modelling and underscores the work by Krummheuer et al. (2018) where the proposal is for smart learning systems focused on intellectual challenges through ‘quick and dirty’ observation techniques. Similarly, Tissenbaum and Slotta (2019) detail stages for the progression of smart classroom from the basic conceptualization to a full-fledged learning environment and underscores the importance of teachers being an integral part of the co-design process team. Th third perspective weighs up the need for integration in models of smart classroom technologies and concepts. From a technology perspective, Alelaiwi et al. (2015) highlight the need to integrate 3G and 4G technology in a smart class model, while Alghamdi and Altameem (2019) suggested the importance of incorporating IoT and RFID in digitalization models for futuristic i-classroom. Conceptually, studies like Bautista and Borges (2013) argue that ideas for smart classrooms are not only limited to innovation that integrate technological artifacts into current practice. Rather, the authors suggest that the concepts for smart classrooms emerge at the intersections between design and ergonomics, with recommendations that the design procedure requires pedagogical collaborative learning, students' autonomy, educational co-responsibility. Similarly, Rao et al. (2019) conceptualize the development of various e-learning programs and learning environments for interactive experiences the integrated new technologies and simulated learning. In acknowledging these varied perspectives for smart classroom system models and ontologies, the main consideration is to ensure support for computing and practical work assessments and implementations within increasingly ubiquitous computing environments (Jou & Wang, 2019; Kalaiselvi & Jayashri, 2017).

4.4. Applying analytical tools and analysis
Applying analytical tools is a technological challenge for comparative analysis (Wang et al., 2019) and relationship testing (Di et al., 2019) to assess determinants for smart classroom adoption and to appraise behavioral and structural benefits of smart classrooms. Literature also contains analyses of metrics for smart devices (Uzelac et al., 2017), scenarios for pedagogical shifts to smart learning environments (Kinshuk et al., 2016). There are also analytical frameworks for comparing traditional and smart classrooms (e.g., Integrated Teaching and Learning and Flanders Interaction Analysis Category Systems (Jo & Lim, 2015)), historical analysis (Schick, 2005), literature analysis of technologies (Wang, 2008) and analysis of different teaching methods on multimedia platforms (Pingxiao, 2017). Some analytical tools used in research studies include learning analytics (Aguilar et al., 2019; Chatti & Muslim, 2019; Tlili et al., 2018), networking analytics (Koulocheri & Xenos, 2019), hierarchical linear models (Leekitchwatana & Pimdee, 2017), Ex-post factor and Derrida's critical methods of analysis (Wogu et al., 2019), and Taguchi's grey relational method (Thiyagarajan et al., 2018). Literature also contains studies applying advanced analytical tools to monitor facial expressions for determining the interactivity of students (Gupta et al., 2019) and using frameworks to compare traditional and smart classrooms (e.g., Integrated Teaching and Learning and Flanders's Interaction Analysis Category Systems (Jo & Lim, 2015).

Generally, this line of research analyzes and sheds the spotlight on variables and attributes of learners such as abilities and characteristics. The application of analytic tools in smart classrooms remains a pertinent issue, and the extensive coverage in literature reflects this trend. A notable feature among these studies is the tendency to use traditional classroom approaches as reference points for assessing the impact of technology integration within smart classrooms, even though the traditional and smart classrooms should have different pedagogical assessments.

4.5. Supporting mobile and social media applications
Another important technological challenge for smart classroom research centers on support for mobile (Suo et al., 2009) and social media applications (Dos Santos, 2019). Proposed technical solutions for mobile applications include capabilities that remotely control and monitor systems using SMS software (Delfin et al., 2019), use smart campus APP and TCP server to enhance the safety of campus (Zheng et al., 2019), and identify concentration level of students in real-time based on a color-coded system (Kim, 2018). Other applications of mobile apps and technologies include context-aware computing (Huang et al., 2019), NoiseSense integrated with RFID (Dutta et al., 2018), and LMRDS (Saraubon, 2019) based on Raspberry Pi 3B+ and mobile devices. There are also specialized mobile applications in smart classrooms involving the creation of multi-modal and device-independent mobile services using appropriate mobile content and content negotiation functions (Lee & Cho, 2013) along with authoring tools that facilitate user-generated content (Hwang et al., 2016). These applications leverage behavioral patterns (Väljataga & Mettis, 2018) for supporting student interaction and attention (Gligoric et al., 2015). The ubiquitous nature of mobile devices provides an opportunity for smart classrooms to gain traction in the educational sector.

In the literature, some scholars also propose conceptual models for incorporating mobile technologies in smart classrooms. For instance, Qin et al. (2007) propose an agent-based context-aware service for smart environments that integrate mobile technology and adopt a formal context model. The proposal applies probabilistic logic (FOPL) and web ontology language (OWL) ontologies, to suggest a similar understanding of contexts for non-time-critical situations. Yau et al. (2002, pp. 233–238) propose a situation-aware application software using reconfigurable context-sensitive middleware with an illustration for a smart classroom. These models recognize that smart devices are bound to pose challenges for the effectiveness of smart classrooms as focus shifts towards maximizing benefits from supporting mobile and social media applications.

5. Summary of socio-technological challenges for smart classroom research
Effective use of smart classrooms ultimately depends on how these learning environments and spaces meet the needs of intended users, i.e., instructors and learners. For educators, there are on-going and pertinent socio-technological challenges that determine topical and critical factors for the assessment, implementation, acceptance of smart classrooms. From a social perspective, the review identifies three main challenges. The first challenge for research involves the creation of intelligent and dynamic user profiles that support personalization for external factors, learning attitudes, and teaching methods, while the second challenge entails deepening knowledge on content-, instructor-, peer-, and technology-based engagement. The third challenge centers on proposing models of interactivity that enhance the experiences of users.

From a technological perspective, the review pinpoints five challenges. The first and foremost challenge concerning designs for learning environments requires paradigms and strategies for smart systems grounded on theory and technological affordances, while the closely linked second challenge entails developing and intelligence for automation, environmental management, security, and integration that achieves emotionally aware classrooms. For the third challenge involving the formulation of smart classroom system models and ontologies, the focus is on proposing architectures, stages, and integration of technologies and concepts. The fourth challenge pertains to difficulties in applying analytics, i.e., metrics and analytical tools, for delivering context-aware services, while the fifth and final challenge involves the proposing technical solutions and conceptual models that support mobile and social media applications.

6. Discussion on future research prospects
This section uses insights from the review to establish prospective methodological, analytical, and topical paths for future research. Methodologically, existing studies apply approaches such as surveys, case studies, and observation studies. Thus, future research could broaden the current methodological space by using methods such as ethnography, action research, focus groups, and experimental interventions. Analytically, the review mainly involves investigations and studies of instructors and learners within the classroom, written from a classroom perspective. This raises prospects for expanding the analytical space to include different stakeholders (e.g., administrators and adult learners) and institutional actors (e.g., ministerial, and governmental agencies). Future research could also target broader socio-cultural and socio-economic contexts for smart technology use in classrooms. Topically, future studies could broaden the current socio-technological discourse on smart classrooms by highlighting additional topical viewpoints that strategically advance research, education, and practice. The following subsections detail these specific topics:

6.1. Smart classroom design for continuity or consistency
The first recommendation is for future research on smart classroom design for continuity and consistency (DFC2). Continuity in the DFC2 context means the presence of a maintained flow within a smart classroom milieu (e.g., understanding monitoring, evaluating, and improving student performance). Here, the challenge is to build on current work aimed at tackling different obstacles posed by digital transitions to smart classrooms. In contrast, consistency means adherence to the set standards, patterns, structure, and attitudes towards people or things, or achieving the same level of performance. Consistency is a challenge for pedagogical effectiveness that ensures compatibility and relevance of a smart classroom design (Ouf et al., 2016) and for alignment with teaching aims and foci considering technology changes (Brock & Curby, 2016). Consistency in the use of facial recognition, for instance, is an area of DFC2 that the literature (e.g., Khan et al. (2019)) highlights as important for further investigation. This review, therefore, challenges researchers to investigate and explore DFC2 practices that ease the integration of current and future smart technologies for innovative classrooms. Such investigations could focus on student autonomy and lessons learnt from system and user errors to promote active, intuitive, and supportive learning processes.

6.2. Smart classroom quality
Another recommendation is for future studies that focus on the quality of smart classrooms. Quality is a multi-faceted concept, which over the years, has been described as attaining excellence through high standards, delivering value according to set conditions, conformance to specifications and requirements, fitness for use, loss avoidance, and meeting and/or exceeding customers’ expectations (Reeves & Bednar, 1994). For educators, quality refers to a central goal/outcome or to identifying specific indicators that reflect desired inputs and outputs (Schindler, Puls-Elvidge, Welzant, & Crawford, 2015). Conventionally, quality in education is often approached from the perspective of traditional classroom settings with the spotlight on quality of students, faculty credentials, academic features, and administrative support (Akareem & Hossain, 2016; Haseena & Mohammed, 2015). However, the quality standards for smart classrooms are likely to be higher than those of conventional classroom settings because the assessment is likely to factor in the IT base supporting smart classroom. Quality, in this sense, considers the degree to which the smart classroom fulfills its intended purpose of enhancing learning and teaching experience with minimal detractions/loss. Existing studies mostly focus on quality of education and the bolstering role of latest and advanced technology (e.g., Naidu et al. (2017)). However, there are gaps in knowledge on the quality of smart classrooms and such gaps require frameworks grounded on academically-sound pedagogy and theory. This crucial aspect of smart classrooms requires investigations to ensure quality framework and metrics for learning environments and tools such as IE-Laboratory, DLPG, WebCT, TORM, AMTM, SameView, SLE, SVIEW and LMRDS. Examples of potential research areas include proposing quality assessment tools and investigating the social, technological, and pedagogical antecedents of smart classroom quality with prospective path models for improved learning behavior and performance. Future studies may choose to compartmentalize the quality of components or focus on more comprehensive quality dimensions within learning environments and tools. Other research efforts may aim to create policies and strategies to systematize smart classroom vetting for integrated, effective, and efficient learning structures that address the needs of students, teachers, and administrators.

6.3. Optimizing the efficiency and sustainability of smart classroom infrastructure
An area worth exploring concerns efficiency and sustainability principles required for high performance and environmentally-friendly smart classroom infrastructure. Future smart classroom infrastructure is bound to include multiple resources that enhance connectivity, monitoring, optimization, control, and automation of classroom systems. Thus, challenges are expected concerning infrastructure availability, costs, coverage, security, scalability, power consumption, and scalability (Fraga-Lamas et al., 2019). As Villegas-Ch, Molina-Enriquez, Chicaiza-Tamayo, Ortiz-Garcés, and Luján-Mora (2019) observe, the current emphasis on the high cost of acquisition of technologies limits coverage on developing policies and applications that facilitate effective and efficient management of energy resources. Smart grids are an example of solutions to optimize energy consumption efficiency by featuring seamless and efficient connectivity between devices and the physical room itself (Pirahandeh & Kim, 2015). Barnes, Gindidis, and Phillipson (2018) also report that by reducing the carbon footprint within the classroom setting, the entire society will benefit, and students will have a more promising future. Yet, the review suggests limited studies focus on how to manage resources used in smart classroom more sustainably. This offers potentially interesting areas for future research.

6.4. Towards a smart classroom modelling language
Review of literature highlights the need for future research on algorithms and paradigms that improve interfaces through studies such as Chauhan et al. (2019), Capuano and Toti (2018), and Shi, Xie, Xu, Shi, et al. (2003). There are also calls (e.g., Dutta et al. (2018)) for future research to bridge the data gap by introducing big data analytics to improve smart classroom learning frameworks. In support of these efforts, this review proposes future research to develop working languages that address and unify discourse related to smart classrooms. Efforts may center on current smart classroom research themes such as ontologies (Qin et al., 2007), structural and functional models (Timms, 2016), and terminologies related to prototypes (Suo et al., 2009). Data analytics is projected to significantly impact the concept of smart classrooms and support for this trend should serve as the focus for future research efforts.

Working languages for smooth communication that ensures all stakeholders understand concepts and ideas (Sanders, 2016, pp. 223–228) represent a potential future focal point for smart classroom research. Interests could involve capturing frequently used terminologies and definitions, with the goal of standardizing these terms, identifying common and universally agreed-upon definitions, and analyzing the nuances of terms for common use within a smart classroom context. Prospects exist for investigations that construct data dictionaries to support learning behaviors in smart classrooms. Additional research could concentrate on the generation of personas, profiles, and algorithms that monitor the progress of using smart classrooms to support continuity and consistency.

Overall, this review recommends these future research directions to develop and refine frameworks for integrating technology in increasingly interactive and productive smart classrooms. The outcome of such research endeavors may expectedly develop more effective, efficient, sustainable, and intelligent classrooms with instructors and learners co-creating, co-producing, and co-contributing to classroom protocols and practices – reinforcing active learning behavior.

7. Conclusions
Information technology continues to influence and transform learning behavior. Smart learning environments involve technologies and systems that provide appropriate content and suggestions, interactively, and actively. However, the adoption, adaptation and use of technology, requires an understanding of system requirements and challenges for learners and instructors. Considering these requirements, researchers posit on a wide range of instances for technology use and integration in a ‘smart classroom’ paradigm that transforms traditional modes of teaching and learning behavior. Yet, there remain socio-technological challenges to capture smart classroom dynamics and to address behavioral and personal learning needs with smart classrooms.

This article systematically reviews the smart classroom literature to capture the socio-technological challenges of current research and to provide possible directions for future research. Two main research questions guide this review: ‘What social challenges influence how smart classrooms are developed?’ (RQ1) and ‘How do smart classroom studies address technological challenges between learners and instructors?’ (RQ2). For the first research question, the review identifies categories of personalization, engagement, and interactivity challenges for smart classrooms. The personalization challenge involves: (i) personalization for external factors with requirements concerning environmental conditions to improve convenience, health, and safety of teaching and learning environments, (ii) personalization for learning attitudes to reflect the different evolving motivations of learners, and (iii) personalization for teaching methods with alternatives that fulfil learner requirements and needs. The engagement challenges cover content, instructor, peer, and technology forms of engagement as avenues for fulfilling interpersonal requirements for communication, collaboration, and cooperative learning, while the interactivity challenge considers support for meaningful experiences during learning.

For the second research question, the review determines that studies on smart classrooms suggest the need to prioritize designing learning environments and integrating intelligent systems, analytical tools and analysis, system models and ontology, and mobile and social media applications.

In identifying the socio-technological challenges emerging in the existing literature on smart classrooms, this review recommends the adoption of a trans-disciplinary perspective in designing and using digital devices more effectively to optimize teaching and learning in smart classrooms. The findings of this review offer prospects to enhance the management of diverse student behaviors in smart classrooms, and to support uninterrupted delivery of quality educational context in virtual and distance learning. However, this review adopts a socio-technological perspective of smart classrooms, which limits the comprehensiveness of the review. Other potential dimensions for consideration include economic viewpoints based on cost-benefits analysis and cognitive aspects that shape perception and task performance. Additionally, this review focuses on smart classroom research and is limited in considering the policies and restrictions on proprietary systems that shape the implementation of smart classrooms. Thus, an awareness of these limitations is important when assessing the findings of this review.

This review sets a future research agenda drawing on current socio-technological challenges. Specifically, the review proposes five important directions for future studies. The first area concerns studies of design for continuity and consistency that hinge on models that maintain flow within smart classrooms and practices that ease the integration of current and future smart technologies. The second area, smart classroom quality, proposes research for quality assessment tools, policies, and strategies, and investigating antecedents for smart classroom quality. The third research area is that of user-generated content and its role in instruction, with specific interest in evaluation tools that assess the current usage of technology. The fourth area argues for improved management of smart classroom resources with integrated efficiency and sustainability principles. The fifth area is for smart classroom modeling languages or terminologies that address and unify discourse related to smart classrooms using data dictionaries, personas, profiles, and algorithms.

In summary, evidence from current literature indicates that the smart classroom topic remains a subject of growing research and importance for the near future. Trends suggest that as technology evolves, so will the concept of smart classrooms, and such that evolution could continue to influence learning behavior well into the future. Therefore, the onus is on education research to harness technological innovation continuously for confronting emerging and on-going pressing issues related to social interaction and technology application in classrooms, with ramifications for inclusive and virtual learning.
