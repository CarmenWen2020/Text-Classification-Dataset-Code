The current study examined the effects of digital escape room perceived by 528 elementary school students. Several precursors connected to those learning practices, namely, gameful experience, collaboration and motivation were examined. A game-based learning questionnaire applied in the study was validated. Findings indicated that students perceived the gameful experience as affecting their motivation and collaboration. Collaboration had a very low effect on motivation, whereas grade level played a mediating role in linking gameful experience and motivation. Significant differences were found between experiment group learning via digital escape room and control group learning via digital games in all main and sub-constructs, when students’ learning via a digital escape room showed higher levels of attitudes in all learning constructs - gameful experience, collaboration, and motivation. Results indicate students preferred the digital escape room game over other digital game-based learning activities in elementary school as it enhanced higher collaboration and social experience among students, greater internal and external motivation to learn, and stronger gameful experience creating challenge, playfulness, and a sense of accomplishment in learning. The study bridges the gap in the knowledge of using digital educational games in elementary school showing the advantage of escape room game effects on student learning.

1. Introduction
Game-based learning and gamification in its different forms is becoming more and more popular in the education system. One of the reasons is that learning via games offers an experience of playfulness which motivates students. An additional reason relates to the social aspect of games, inviting collaboration between students.

One such game is the escape room and escape boxes. Applied in the educational context they can be used on-site, turning the class into an escape room exposing students to a relevant story that needs to be solved in groups within a limited time. This presents a challenge to the students who need to discover codes and unlock boxes to solve the case. An additional challenging situation is when the escape room game is offered to students online in a digital form asking students to collaborate from home to solve a case relating to a topic studied in class relying on internet connection and preventing face-to face communication.

Many of the recent studies available on escape room refer to design or logistics (Clare, 2015; Clarke et al., 2017; Duggins, 2019; Karageorgiou, Mavrommati, & Fotaris, 2019; Merx, Veldkamp, & van Winden, 2020); and focus on higher education in general (Fotaris & Mstoras, 2019), or different fields: computer education (Borrego, Fernández, Blanes, & Robles, 2017), engineering (Queiruga-Dios, Santos Sánchez, Queiruga Dios, Gayoso Martínez, & Hernández Encinas, 2020), and medicine (Jambhekar, Pahls, & Deloney, 2020). Veldkamp and van de Grint (2020) conducted a systematic review of escape rooms in education and found that only three articles were published relating to secondary education focusing on science or Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).

Fotaris and Mastras (2019) also indicated that very few articles related to escape room in elementary and secondary education. While Botturi and Babazadeh (2020) focused on teacher education, Martens and Crawford (2019) related to teachers' perceptions of escape room effects in secondary education. A single article published recently related to elementary school students (Huang, Kuo, & Chen, 2020) and investigated 4th grade elementary students' motivation and problem-solving skills.

The current study tried to bridge the gap in knowledge relating to educational escape room and its effects in elementary school. It focused on the effect of learning via a digital escape room in elementary school and sought to understand the direct and indirect effects on the gameful experience, student collaboration, and student motivation, as well as their influence by grade and gender. It also compared lower and upper elementary school students’ attitudes towards learning via a digital game versus learning via a digital escape room. This study could offer insights to researchers and educators on the effects of the digital escape room and its application as a learning tool used in online learning environments.

2. Literature review
2.1. Digital game-based learning
Game-based learning involves affective, behavioral cognitive and social/cultural engagement elements facilitated by design features that result in a playful experience (Plass, Homer & Kinzer, 2015). Stewart et al. (2013) noted that there are two types of digital games, the ones designed for instructional purposes, and those intended for commercial use. Among educational games aimed at achieving learning outcomes, there are three types: 1. aiming to achieve knowledge transfer (cognitive learning outcomes). 2. aiming to achieve skill acquisition (skill-based learning outcomes). 3. aiming to achieve attitudinal/behavioral change (affective learning outcomes). Educational games, primarily developed for the purpose of educating or training, often combine the concentration demanded by challenging activities and the enjoyment experienced when maximally utilizing one's skills, as in “serious play” or “playful work” (Csikszentmihalyi & Schneider, 2000).

Qian and Clark (2016) found that a game-based learning approach might be effective in facilitating students’ 21st-century skill development. Hainey, Connolly, Boyle, Azadegan, Razak & Gray (2014) surveyed 29 studies dealing with game-based learning in elementary school. They found that teachers used games to promote knowledge acquisition in target areas. Games were used in a variety of subjects (mathematics, science, language arts, and social sciences) and mixed effects were reported compared to control groups. In other words, some found positive effects of games, and some found that students in control groups acquired higher levels of knowledge, while others found no difference between the experiment group learning via games and control group learning in a traditional format.

2.2. Digital escape rooms
Escape rooms or escape boxes are used as a gameful experience or game-based activity to promote learning. While game-based learning is defined as learning during the process of playing or gaming, gamification uses game features and thinking to increase motivation and improve problem solving (Ceker & Ozdamh, 2017; Chapman & Rich, 2018 in; Duggins, 2019).

Recreational escape rooms were first used in Japan in 2007 (Corkill, 2009), and grew rapidly in 2012–2013. They started as a combination of different activities with common elements, such as treasure hunts, adventure games, shows and movies, live action role-playing, interactive theater and haunted houses, and digital games (Nicholson, 2015). He defines escape rooms as live-action team-based games where players discover clues, solve puzzles, and accomplish tasks in one or more rooms in order to accomplish a specific goal (usually escaping from the room) within a limited amount of time (p. 1). He explains that in addition to teamwork, communication, and delegation, escape rooms also require critical and lateral thinking as well as attention to detail (Nicholson, 2015).

Educational escape rooms. Educational escape rooms were started by teachers who developed them based on their experience with recreational escape rooms or escape room video games (Franco & DeLuca, 2019 in Veldkamp, van de Grint, Knippels, & van Joolingen, 2020). Healy (2019) explains that educational escape room differs from other games by posing problem-solving tasks, which need to be solved within a time limit, using various puzzles and challenges, providing suspense and rewards (p. 24). Fotaris and Mastoras (2019) elaborate and explain that educational escape rooms possess certain characteristics relating to: game type (physical, digital, mixed); location (classroom or lab); time limit (average of 30–60 min); and team size (5–10 members). Botturi and Babazadeh (2020) developed a star model indicating that the educational escape rooms have five elements: 1. The narrative - the story. 2. The game flow - the structure of the game. 3. Puzzles. 4. Equipment items (physical or digital). And 5. Learning process.

Another model developed by Clarke et al. (2017) for designing educational escape rooms based on recreational ones (Clare, 2015) added two important aspects comprising learning goals before and their evaluation after the experience. Veldkamp and van de Grint (2020) pointed out that goals for educational escape rooms need to be separated to educational goals and game goals. Furthermore, they concluded that there is a discrepancy between the actual achievement of goals relating to content knowledge measured by pre-and posttests, and self-report. They recommend aligning escape rooms with the classroom, and systematically evaluating student outcomes. To aid with learning and evaluation process, Eukel and Morrell (2020) suggest a cycle design process to promote deep learning and positive student perceptions comprising designing, piloting, evaluation, redesign, re-evaluation, and repetition.

Among advantages of educational escape rooms mentioned by Fotaris and Mastoras (2019) who reviewed 68 studies focusing on educational escape rooms were reported gains in motivation, teamwork, social interaction, and some learning gains. Elaborating on that, Veldkamp and associates (2020) added creating active or hybrid learning environments and promoting communication skills.

The design of an educational escape room (Botturi & Babazadeh, 2020) involves challenges like lack of resources, investment of time, and available space in school. They further noted that the planning stage, testing of the game/puzzles and debriefing stage after the game need to be considered by teachers. Additional challenges or constraints mentioned by Guigon, Humeau, & Vermeulen (2018) are the limited number of players that can play in one session in an on-site activity, materials which need to be multiplied to fit the number of players, monitoring the game by at least one guide who is well acquainted with it, and carefully fitting in the learning context into the different riddles.

Escape boxes. Escape boxes are a variation of educational escape rooms overcoming logistical and time challenges using different available platforms (Duggins, 2019). Healy (2019) reported on developing escape boxes for fifty high school students introducing them to the different disciplines of entomology. High school students were divided into ten teams of five, and escape activity started by a story exposing them to a murder case involving the different disciplines and setting a time limit of 60 min. Five escape boxes were built so that each puzzle related to a specific challenge/task in a different discipline and required students to open a lock. During the process students were provided with information in different forms including scientific literature. The final box was unlocked by matching all gathered information from previously solved assignments. She pointed out some advantages of escape boxes comprising low costs for developing ten identical kits, versatility in changing certain boxes to incorporate new challenges or topics, and creating student enjoyment and learning (Healy, 2019).

Veldkamp, van de Grint, et al., 2020 illustrated adapting escape room concept to educational setting in secondary school by designing a unique box which had assignments on different sides inviting students to collaborate face-to-face. As a result of their experiment on designing the escape box, they suggested certain guidelines including co-creating escape room with target audience, using a design framework; planning hybrid learning spaces, and planning tests to investigate learning.

There are currently ample platforms available online offering games and options for designing different types of escape rooms. Google Forms (Neumann, Alvarado-Albertorio, & Ramírez-Salgado, 2020) offers the option to design an escape room using its platform, showing simple steps for the teacher interested in applying riddles, escape boxes, and codes that students need to discover to finish the game. Another platform is Genial.ly (Jiménez, Arís, Magreñán Ruiz, & Orcos, 2020). Results of designing a digital escape room using Genial.ly showed a low significant difference in using digital escape room compared to traditional learning of Algebra in higher education students.

2.3. Components of game-based learning or gamification
The current study will focus on the three components relevant to elementary school students: the gameful experience, working in groups defined as collaboration, and motivation.

2.3.1. Gameful experience
Game experience has been defined as “an ensemble made up of the player's sensations, thoughts, feelings, actions, and meaning-making in a gameplay setting” (Ermi & Mäyrä, 2005), i.e., the interaction between the game and the player. When playing a game, the player is in a playful state of mind (Salen, Tekinbaş, & Zimmerman, 2004) otherwise named playfulness (Hamari & Koivisto, 2015) which creates enjoyment. Enjoyment could be described as an outcome, but also a dimension of the game experience, but it needs to be distinguished from experience and engagement (Högberg, Hamari, & Wästlund, 2019). The gameful experience as distinguished from game experience was defined by Högberg et al. (2019) as an experience that “may occur, but does not have to, when a user of a service interacts or has interacted with intentionally or unintentionally implemented motivational affordances (for gameful experiences). The goal of creating such gameful experiences is to spur motivation for both continued service use and for a targeted behavior. Therefore, the intended effect of a gamified service stretches beyond the game phase and into the postgame phase” (p.629). The components they included were accomplishment, challenge, competition, guided use, and immersion. The above definition and components could also apply to educational games.

Vorderer, Klimmt, and Ritterfeld (2004) explained that challenge is connected to the level of difficulty of the game which confronts the players’ abilities and makes them want to achieve. Hamari, and associates (2016) found that the challenge of the game had a positive effect on learning both directly and via the increased engagement. They concluded that in order to create continued learning in game-based learning environments, the design of educational games needs to consider the level challenge of the game.

2.3.2. Motivation
Motivation is comprised of two main constructs: intrinsic and extrinsic (Ryan & Deci, 2000a). In the current study, immersion was added to the motivation construct as the following studies and scholars seem to think they are connected. Meta-analytic evidence suggests that gamification has positive effects on learning and motivation (Sailer & Homner, 2020). Furthermore, (Squire (2003) explained that games and gamification are used in education because traditional learning can be boring and they can improve students’ learning motivation of by entering a flow state in playing, which increases their concentration.

2.3.2.1. Immersion
Immersion is defined as entering a cognitive state of being “in the game” (Cairns, Cox, & Nordin, 2014). Motivation according to Lombard and Ditton (1997) and Wirth et al. (2007), is a prerequisite to experience presence or immersion. Flow is described as very similar to immersion, as it is exhibited by intense concentration, loss of the sense of time, and a merge between action and awareness (Csikszentmihalyi, 2014; Csikszentmihalyi, Abuhamdeh, & Nakamura, 2014) for the purpose of achievement or winning. Csikszenthimalyi (1988) explained that he believed flow and motivational factors were connected. Weibel and Wissmath (2011) placed motivation and immersion tendency together, defining them as personal characteristics.

2.3.2.2. Intrinsic motivation
Intrinsic motivation refers to the desire to perform an activity for itself (Ryan & Deci, 2000b). Intrinsically motivated players play because they enjoy exploring the game and improving their skills, or because they like the thrill and strong sensation the game provides (Lafrenière, Verner-Filion & Vallera, 2012). Dickey (2011) found that digital game-based learning could promote students’ intrinsic motivation.

2.3.2.3. Extrinsic motivation
Extrinsic motivation refers to engaging in an activity as a means to an end and not for its own sake. Thus, extrinsically motivated individuals participate in an activity in order to receive something positive or avoid some negative implication (Lafrenière, Verner-Filion & Vallera, 2012). To elaborate on that, game dynamics tend to motivate people through positive feedback, such as collecting points, badges, status, progress, customization, pleasant surprises, etc.; they know exactly where they stand and what they have to do to win or achieve their goals (Dichev, Dicheva, Angelova, & Agre, 2015).

2.3.3. Collaboration
“Collaboration not only allows for team work and thus the experience of being important to others, but it also enables learners to master challenges they otherwise might not be able to overcome on their own, which can result in feelings of competence” (Sailer & Homner, 2020, p. 81). This means that collaboration has a strong connection to gameful experience.

Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) was selected by the Organization for Economic.

Co-operation and Development (OECD) as a key skill that should be developed and assessed by the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) (OECD, 2013). It is widely acknowledged that CPS is an essential skill at home, at work, and in the community (Greasser, Foltz, Rosen, Williamson Shaffer, Forsyth & Germany, 2018) and most of the planning, problem solving and decision making are performed in groups or teams (National Research Council, 2011). Sung and Hwang (2013) found that collaborative game-based learning improved students’ learning motivation, as well as learning achievement and self-efficacy.

Four indicators for collaboration were chosen for this study: group cohesiveness, group effectiveness, group efficacy, all of which were found to be connected by Jung and Sosik (2002), and social experience which was indicated by Högberg et al. (2019) as part of the game experience.

2.3.3.1. Group cohesiveness
Cohesiveness refers to the degree to which group members are attracted to and motivated to stay with the group (Zaccaro, Blair, Peterson, & Zazanis, 1995). Dornyei (2009) mentioned three elements that can affect group cohesiveness in learning: 1. interpersonal attraction, 2. commitment to task, and 3. group pride/prestige. He also described the characteristics of a cohesive group: (a) welcoming atmosphere; (b) mutual attention; (c) loyalty; (d) paying attention to group norms; (e) voluntary participation and pleasure working in the group; (f) easy cooperation; (g) active participation and sharing; (h) referring to group as “we”; (i) competitive relationship with other groups; (j) easy expression of satisfaction; and (k) easy participation in the group.

2.3.3.2. Group effectiveness
Group effectiveness is measured by the extent to which the members of the group achieve their goals and complete their tasks together (Jung & Sosik, 2002). Group or team effectiveness also involves joint planning and informal communication (Ambrose & Rutherford, 2016).

2.3.3.3. Group efficacy
Group or collective efficacy refers to group members’ shared perceptions about how capable their group is regarding a specific task (Bandura, 1997).

It relies on past positive experience and success which can make group members believe in their group's ability (Lindsley, Brass, & Thomas, 1995).

2.3.3.4. Social experience
Social experience in games is about socializing, relationship formation and teamwork (Yee, 2006) and a feeling of connectedness (Rogers, 2017) which does not have to be real, but could also be virtual (Lee, 2004).

2.4. Focus of study
Based on the above-surveyed studies, the current study sought to examine:

1.
How will students' attitudes to their collaboration and motivation be connected to their gameful experience studying via digital escape room and other digital games?

2.
How will students' attitudes differ relating to their collaboration, motivation and gameful experience studying via digital escape room compared to other digital games?

3.
What differences will be found in research group studying via escape room according to background variables?

To this end, the following hypotheses were tested:

(H1)

Gameful experience will be positively connected to motivation (Högberg et al., 2019). Each of these constructs includes three sub-constructs (as indicated in the Instrumentation section below). To better understand the participants' tendency towards each of these sub-factors that jointly facilitate the factors, an effort will be made to identify the most dominant sub-factor/s. These analyses will allow identifying possible areas that need to be addressed to improve learning.

(H2)

Gameful experience will be positively connected to collaboration (Sailer & Homner, 2020).

(H3)

Collaboration will be positively connected to motivation (Sung and Hwang (2013).

(H4)

Differences will be detected between students' attitudes towards learning via digital escape rooms and students' learning via digital game-based learning in general, and learning constructs, when students' learning via a digital escape room will show higher levels of attitudes in learning constructs (gameful experience, collaboration, motivation) compared to their counterparts.

3. Method
3.1. Participants
Data were gathered by research assistants from 528 students from public Jewish and Arab elementary schools in Israel. Table 1 presents the study population.


Table 1. Study population (N = 528).

Digital Game (N = 237)	Digital Escape Room (N = 291)	Total
Gender
N (%)	Boys	117 (49.4%)	149 (51.2%)	266 (50.4%)
Girls	120 (50.6%)	142 (48.8%)	262 (49.6%)

4–6	212 (89.5%)	222 (76.3%)	434 (82.2%)
All students were from middle to high Socio-Economic Status (SES) studying in heterogenous classes with medium ability and a good level of computer skills. Student groups were assigned at classroom level. Younger students in grades 2 and 3 in both groups received more instructions and were closely monitored by the teacher. From the total number of study population (N = 528), the research group learning via a digital escape room consisted a little more than half (N = 291, 55%) and the control group (N = 237, 45%). Boys and girls were equally represented in the study. Most students participating were from upper elementary school (76% in the research group and 89.5% in the control group). The total percentage of students participating from upper elementary school (grades 4–6) was 82.2% and the rest were from lower grades (grades 2–3). Students from Arabic-speaking schools made up 15% of the study population equally distributed in both groups.

3.2. Instrumentation
Game-Based Learning Questionnaire. As the instrument used in the current study consisted of different parts of questionnaires aimed at gamers, and or adults, they were revised and combined to address elementary school students' attitudes to game-based learning. Table 2 presents explanations of the main factors based on sub-factors used in the study, item examples, explained variance and Cronbach's alpha.

Total GBL Questionnaire		62		0.97
3.2.1. Students' gameful experience scale
This 26-item scale (Högberg et al., 2019) using a 5-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 = completely disagree to 5 = completely agree (α = 0.93) was initially designed to assess gameful experience among adults using gamified services and was adapted for the current study. It consisted of three sub-scales in which students were asked to report their level of agreement with the statements on accomplishment (8 items, α = 0.90), example statements: “The activity made me feel I needed to complete things” and “The activity made me strive to take myself to the next level”; challenge (9 items, α = 0.78), example statements: “The activity made me do things that were highly demanding” and “It made me feel I continuously needed to improve in order to do well”; and playfulness (9 items, α = 0.95) example statements: “The activity gave me a playful experience” and “The activity felt like a mystery to reveal”.

3.2.2. Collaboration scale
This scale was constructed by Jung and Sosik (2002) to examine transformational leadership among firm leaders. For the purposes of the current study, this 21-item scale was adapted to collaboration with the addition of social experience (Högberg et al., 2019) using 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = completely disagree to 5 = completely agree (α = 0.98). It consisted of four sub-scales in which students were asked to report their level of agreement with the statements on (a) group cohesiveness (3 items, α = 0.85), example statements: “I felt that people in my group had high problem-solving skills” and “I felt that people in my group were friends”; (b) group efficacy (5 items, α = 0.89), example statements: “I felt my group could pull itself out of hardship” and “My group members worked hard to fulfill all assignments”; (c) group effectiveness (4 items, α = 0.95), example statements: “My group is effective in getting things done” and “My group completed its tasks successfully”; and (d) social experience (9 items, α = 0.96) (Högberg et al. (2019) example statements: “I felt I was not alone” and “I felt that the group members supported me”.

3.2.3. Motivation scale
This 15-item scale was based on Högberg et al. (2019) and.

Lafrenière, Verner-Filion, and Vallerand (2012) gaming motivation scale designed for video game players and was adapted for the current study. This 5-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 = completely disagree to 5 = completely agree (α = 0.94) included three factors: (a) immersion (9 items, α = 0.92) Högberg et al. (2019) example statements: “It made me lose myself in the activity” and “It made me ignore everything around me”; (b) internal motivation (3 items, α = 0.90) example statements: “I felt I was able do things while I was playing” and “I played because it was fun/exciting/enjoyable to participate in the activity”; and (c) external motivation (3 items, α = 0.83) example statements: “I participated in the activity to acquire rare and expensive items and open hidden things” and “I participated in the activity so that my friends would think that I was a good player”.

A background questionnaire (4 items) was used to gather demographic data and identify variables (detailed in the Participants section) that may intersect with the research factors.

All parts of the questionnaire were translated from English. Forward and back-translation with an expert to assess the translations, as well as pilot testing, were used to develop the Hebrew and Arabic version of the questionnaires.

3.3. Procedure
Games were prepared by teachers in students' language of study to create similar experience. Student groups were assigned at classroom level. The aim was to enhance learning of a specific topic by exposing students to a digital game-based experience. One class received the intervention, and a parallel class received a different digital game. Collaborative groups within classes were formed according to student choice. Participants answered the questionnaire post-activity. The research group completed an online digital escape room in small groups of five students each in a formal school distance learning setting with teacher-monitoring. As groups worked separately with the teacher, the effect of competition between groups was eliminated. The only competition was against the clock. The digital escape room was designed based on the rules introduced earlier using the Google Forms platform (Neumann et al., 2020).

Digital games description. The aims of both digital game-based activities were similar: (a) student will experience learning via a digital game-based activity. (b) student will be motivated to learn the new topic. (c) student will develop teamwork skills. (d) student will develop thinking skills. and (e) student will develop content knowledge in the new topic.

The questionnaire specifically designed for the study focused on aims a (gameful experience),b (motivation), and c (collaboration).

Digital escape room. The digital escape room had a theme and a story, challenging students to solve a problem/mystery, and instructions for working collaboratively to solve the case within 45 min. Students needed to solve puzzles, apply codes to open boxes at different stages, leading them to a final code for unlocking the last box and solving the case. Themes relating to topic studied in the curriculum ranged from certain holidays (Purim or Passover) to nutrition, mathematics (shapes), and environment (water and air pollution). All stories were short but had an element of urgency to find solution within a time limit of 45 min. Instructions of behavior which followed to story focused on working in groups of up to five students and following certain stages. Each digital escape room was designed using google forms platform had 5 riddles on a selected topic which students needed to solve. Solution of one riddle led to the next. The solution of the final riddle was a combination of numbers representing all former riddles.

Digital game. Students in the control group studied the same topic as their peers in the same grade level via a digital game-based learning activity played online in groups of five for one lesson lasting 45 min with the monitoring of the same homeroom teacher. Students in this group played jigsaw puzzles, memory games, and guessing games related to the topic. Each lesson comprised two digital games played online relating to the topic.

For both groups it was the first encounter with playing a digital game in a formal school distance learning setting. Both digital escape room and digital games were played in groups, in a gameful setting. The difference between the two types of games derived from their nature. The escape room game was one game based on a story divided into different parts presenting riddles/problems to students that needed to be solved in groups within a time limit. The other digital games were separate from each other, but still posed challenges of guessing, finding words, and memorizing locations of words and connections between them. After both lessons there was a debriefing session with the teacher.

Both groups answered the same online questionnaire post-activity. The questionnaire was divided into three parts (gameful experience, collaboration, and motivation) to facilitate the process for the younger students as it had more than 60 items. The students were required to report their pre-assigned number once they had completed a certain part. The three parts of the questionnaire were combined by keeping track of the students’ numbers.

The participants had volunteered to answer the online questionnaire. It was specified that the questionnaires were anonymous, and the participants were assured that no specific identifying information about the schools would be required or processed. It was also indicated that students' grades and other formative assessment procedures would not be affected by a student's refusal to answer the questionnaire. The study was preauthorized by the college Ethics Committee.

3.4. Data analysis
Reliability (alpha) of the questionnaire and its constructs was examined. Pearson correlations were used to detect connections between constructs, and MANCOVA analyses were used to examine differences between groups and the influence of background variables. Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM; Hair, Hult, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2017), was applied for assessing direction of connections and the prediction of target constructs. SPSS 25 and Smart PLS 3 software programs were used.

4.2. Research hypotheses examination
In order to test the first research hypothesis, Pearson correlations were conducted between the research variables (Table 4).

Table 4 shows that positive significant strong correlations were found between the research variables, with the exception of challenge and collaboration, which was very low. This means that the students perceived all constructs and sub-constructs relevant to their learning via games, with gameful experience showing a strong connection to motivation and collaboration.

4.3. Testing the model and validation of questionnaire
In order to assess the first three research hypotheses Model 2 Fig. 2 was constructed. This path model includes three constructs, represented in the model as cycles: Gameful Experience, Collaboration, and Motivation. In addition, the Gender, and Grade level background variables’ effect on the above constructs were checked in this model: The indicators are the directly measured variables represented by rectangles, and the arrows represent the relationship between constructs and indicators. Paths were specified in accordance with the theoretical model.

Fig. 2. Path analysis digital game-based learning.

Results of path analysis indicated an influence of Gameful Experience on Motivation (0.717), and Collaboration (0.472), and Grade level (0.319) and lower influence on Gender (0.039). Collaboration showed a low effect on Motivation (0.162).

A bootstrap routine was used to detect direct and indirect significant path coefficient results. Table 5 displays the analysis results of the direct and indirect effects for Model 2 (Fig. 2).


Table 5. Significance analysis of the direct and indirect effects.

Gameful Experience - > Collaboration	0.472	6.035	0.000			
Gameful Experience - > Grade	0.319	5.073	0.000

Grade - > Motivation	−0.162	2.370	0.018			
Gameful Exp - > Grade - > Motivation				0.052	1.995	0.047
Gameful Experience - > Collaboration- > Motivation				0.076	1.756	0.080
The highest significant direct moderate results were shown between the following constructs: Gameful Experience – Motivation, Gameful Experience – Collaboration, and Gameful Experience and Grade level. The lowest positive result was found between Collaboration and Motivation. The background variable of Grade level showed low negative effects on Motivation and Collaboration. Concerning the indirect effects, Collaboration had no mediating effect connecting Gameful Experience and Motivation, and Grade level had a low mediating effect connecting Gameful Experience and Motivation.

The model evaluation included several steps. First, collinearity was examined by the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) showing that values of all combinations of endogenous and exogenous constructs are below the threshold of 5 (Hair et al., 2017), therefore, collinearity among the predictor constructs is not a critical issue in this structural model. An exception was detected in the control group for the dimension of Collaboration and its sub-factors, when VIF was higher that the threshold of 5 (group effectiveness = 8.084, group efficiency = 7.402, and social experience = 5.467). The only sub-factor of Collaboration below the threshold of 5 was group cohesiveness (4.347).

Next, the coefficient of determination (R2) value was examined showing endogenous factors ranged from 0.214 for Collaboration and 0.597 for Motivation considered low to moderate (Hair et al., 2017). The change in R2 value referred to as effect size f2 (Cohen, 1988) was measured showing a very high effect result between Gameful Experience and Motivation (2.55) when Gameful Experience had a high but lower effect size on collaboration (0.912). No effect was detected between Collaboration and Motivation. According to the results, the background variables had no effect sizes on the endogenous variables.

Lastly, the blindfolding procedure was used to assess the predictive relevance (Q2) of the path model. According to Hair et al. (2017) values larger than 0 suggest that the model has predictive relevance for a certain endogenous construct. The Q2 value indicted for Motivation (0.523) and for Collaboration (0.326) were larger than 0 but Gender and Grade level were lower than the threshold. Two of three research hypotheses were corroborated, and the research model was validated.

4.4. Differences between groups
In order to test the fourth hypothesis relating to differences between students learning via a digital game-based activity and students learning via a digital escape room, a one-way MANCOVA analysis was performed. Table 4 presents differences between groups in total perception of game-based learning and sub-constructs. A significant difference was found between students learning via a digital game-based activity and students learning via a digital escape room in the perception of game-based learning (F(1,510) = 591.7; p < .001, η2 = 0.537). Next, one-way MANCOVA analyses were performed in order to test the source of the significance between the two groups of students regarding the perceptions of game-based learning. MANCOVA results are presented in Table 6 showing Mean and SD differences on a scale of 1–5, F test results with significance, and size effect.

As Table 6 demonstrates, significant differences were found in total game based attitudes (F(1,510) = 591.7; p < .001, η2 = 0.537 for all three constructs, Gameful Experience (F(1,510) = 538.6; p < .001, η2 = 0.514); Collaboration (F(1,510) = 139.6.; p < .001, η2 = 0.215); and Motivation (F(1,510) = 777.4; p < .001, η2 = 0.604). This means that students learning via a digital escape room have a more positive perception of the gameful experience, their motivation to play, and their collaborative performance during the game compared to their counterparts in the control group.

Both groups rated Collaboration the highest (control 3.5 and experiment (4.3). In the control group students rated Collaboration the highest (3.5) and Motivation lowest (2.6), while experiment group rated Collaboration highest (4.3) and Gameful Experience lowest (3.9) although significantly higher compared to counterparts.

Investigating within each construct, the most significant difference between the two groups within Gameful Experience was in playfulness (F(1,524) = 417.412, p < .001, ηp2 = 0.603), where challenge was the lowest (F(1,524) = 23.549, p < .001, ηp2 = 0.043). Both control and experiment groups rated playfulness the highest and challenge as the lowest component of the gameful experience. Both the control and experiment groups rated Collaboration the highest of the indicators (3.5 and 4.3 respectively). The most significant difference was in social experience (F(1,523) = 138.237, p < .001, ηp2 = 0.209), and the lowest was in group cohesiveness (F(1,523) = 58.905, p < .001, ηp2 = 0.137). For Motivation, immersion (F(1,510) = 715.188, p < .001, ηp2 = 0.584) and internal motivation (F(1,510) = 470.987, p < .001, ηp2 = 0.480) differences were very substantial, and external motivation difference was lower (F(1,510) = 332.984, p < .001, ηp2 = 0.395) but still substantial compared to other indicators. In both groups external motivation was rated the lowest. In the control group, group cohesiveness and group effectiveness were rated highest, while in the experiment group they valued the most internal motivation and group effectiveness.

To further investigate the source of differences in the research group learning via digital escape room independent variables were examined. No differences were detected according to gender. Table 7 presents differences found between grade levels in the experiment group showing Mean and SD differences on a scale of 1–5, confidence interval for Mean, F values with significance, and size effect.

Table 7 shows significant differences between students from upper elementary (grades 4–6) and lower elementary (grades 2–3) classes in total perception of game-based learning (F(1,290) = 29.10, p < .001, ηp2 = 0.096), and in all constructs Gameful Experience (F(1,290) = 36.70, p < .001, ηp2 = 0.118); Collaboration (F(1,289) = 5.80, p < .05, ηp2 = 0.021); and Motivation (F(1,276) = 17.50, p < .001, ηp2 = 0.060). Students in grades 4–6 perceived gameful experience and motivation on a higher level compared to their counterparts. The differences between the two groups relating to collaboration were still significant, but less so.

Examination within each construct showed that the most significant difference between the two groups of grade levels within Gameful Experience was in playfulness (F(1,290) = 48.88, p < .001, ηp2 = 0.151). The lowest evaluation in both groups was detected in challenge, showing a small difference between the groups (F(1,290) = 5.76, p < .05, ηp2 = 0.021). Within Motivation, the most significant difference detected was in internal motivation (F(1,276) = 16.82, p < .001, ηp2 = 0.058), and in Collaboration group efficacy (F(1,289) = 10.71, p < .01, ηp2 = 0.038). Low or no differences were detected in all other indicators of Collaboration.

Consequently, results show that significant differences were detected in the perception of digital game-based learning and its constructs between the two groups (learning via a digital escape room and learning via a digital game-based activity) in total, as well as all tested constructs. Thus, the fourth hypothesis was confirmed. As indicated, the differences originate from upper elementary school students’ perceptions, and are not influenced by gender.

5. Discussion
The main aim of this study was to examine how an educational digital escape room in elementary school influences students’ gameful experience, collaboration, and motivation. Therefore, we looked at the connections between the main constructs and their indicators. The results revealed a strong connection between the students' perceptions of the gameful experience learning via the digital escape room and motivation and collaboration. In other words, students learning via the digital escape room believed that the gameful experience affected their sense of motivation and collaboration. Indeed, previous studies found a connection between digital and game-based learning or gamification and motivation (Sailer & Homner, 2020; Squire, 2003). However, the current study elaborates on these previous findings by analyzing important educational game constructs and their interrelations, which play a role in learning in educational escape rooms.

While most of these studies investigating gameful experience were performed on adult gamers (Hamari & Koivisto, 2015; Högberg et al., 2019), the current study focused on elementary school students studying via a digital escape room.

Examination of the effect of the gameful experience in a digital escape room on motivation indicated a strong effect stemming from intrinsic motivation: the students perceived the digital escape room as an incentive to learn without outside intervention forcing them to do so, but just for the sake of playing and learning. They also found themselves immersed in the game which increased their motivation and sense of playfulness. Research supports this connection between intrinsic motivation and gameful experience, indicating that intrinsic motivation comes from enjoyment, the thrill of the game, or the desire to improve skills (Lafrenière et al., 2012).

Although collaboration was perceived by the students as connected to the gameful experience, and especially group efficacy, collaboration was not perceived by students as mediating between gameful experience and motivation. Sailer and Homner (2020) explain this connection by pointing out that teamwork enables mastering challenges and enhances feelings of competence. Believing in the capabilities of the group, which constitutes group efficacy (Lindley et al., 1995), could contribute to students’ beliefs they could cope with the assignments because of the group.

Playfulness was perceived as having the strongest effect on the students’ gameful experience, while surprisingly challenge had the least. Playfulness is the experience of being involved in pleasurable behaviors driven by imagination or exploration (Högberg et al., 2019) which perfectly fits the digital escape room involving mystery, imagination and exploration (Duggins, 2019; Nicholson, 2018).

Therefore, it was also expected that learning via a digital escape room, which has a mystery story, riddles, breakout boxes and hidden codes, would challenge the students to learn. Hamari et al. (2016) suggested that challenge needs to be considered in order to encourage continued learning. Vorderer et al. (2004) explained that challenge is connected to the level of difficulty of the game, which confronts the players’ abilities and makes them want to achieve. This surprise finding could be explained by the fact that many students although perceiving the playfulness aspect as high, found the level of difficulty of the assignment/riddles and learning too low.

Comparing digital games to the digital escape room revealed significant differences between the two groups in all constructs and indicators. Students studying via the digital escape room rated all constructs and indicators significantly higher compared to their counterparts studying via digital games. This difference could stem from the nature of the game played. Even though both types of games were new to the students, the digital escape room was perceived as more effective for the examined constructs. Students in control group studying via simple, and shorter digital games like memory games, jigsaw puzzles and guessing games which were incorporated in their lesson seemed to experience average motivation, collaboration and gameful experience. Their counterparts studying via digital escape room which was a more complicated game involving a story, and different riddles that needed to be solved within a time limit of a full lesson, felt the game was more motivating, lending for group collaboration, and created a stronger gameful experience. The study showed that although both digital games showed positive effects, elementary school students preferred the more complicated and challenging game.

As grade level was found to affect the gameful experience, further investigation was carried out in the experiment group studying via the digital escape room. The effect of grade level was detected, meaning that the older students studying in grades 4–6 perceived all three main constructs as higher compared to their lower grade level counterparts, but the pattern of attributing most importance to Collaboration, and then similarly to Gameful Experience and Motivation was maintained. The mediating effect of grade level between Gameful Experience and Motivation could only partially explain the results. This was expected, as younger elementary students are less capable due to developmental cognitive abilities to assess the aspects compared to older students.

5.2. Conclusions and implications
The purpose of the study was to understand the effects of digital escape room game on elementary school students. By focusing on escape room as a learning tool in elementary school this paper shows a detailed picture of students' attitudes in three major areas related to game-based learning which are collaboration, motivation, and gameful experience.

In conclusion, the study used a large sample of elementary school students who stated they preferred the digital escape room over other digital games in all three aspects: collaboration, motivation, and gameful experience. The study elaborated on students' perceptions of sub-constructs of collaboration, including group effectiveness, cohesiveness, efficacy, and social experience; motivation, including immersion, internal and external motivation; and gameful experience comprising playfulness, accomplishment, and challenge. Study results showed higher benefits of the digital escape room perceived by elementary school students in all tested main and sub-constructs compared to counterparts studying via other digital games. These attitudes towards studying via digital escape room, highly stressed by older elementary students compared to younger ones, could shed light on their preference and need for meaningful work in groups, challenging assignments that could capture their attention and motivation, in a playful setting that could enhance their sense of accomplishment.

Results focusing on these aspects of digital escape game could be beneficial for elementary school teachers and researchers to create better understanding of the general and specific effects it has on students in the process of learning. As basic elements of using games were addressed in the current study, these effects could be expected to occur in on-site escape rooms as well and could be examined for their increase or decrease due to the change in learning environment.

As participation in an escape game activity showed significant positive effects among elementary school students, they could be further challenged to design an escape room, whether digital or on-site, as a final project for the benefit of other students in their grade level, entire school, or the community, focusing on a relevant topic. Indications of the effects of such a project on their collaboration, motivation, and gameful experience could be examined to further understand their implications.

5.3. Limitations and directions for future research
The current study has several limitations and offers directions for future research. First, several variables that were not tested in this research might have impacted students’ perceptions of studying via a digital escape room. For example, learning achievements of students learning via digital games and escape rooms could add extra indications to the effectiveness of the escape room as a learning tool. Examination of learning achievements could be performed by an online test or quiz given prior and post intervention, comparing the knowledge acquired by the research group and control group.

Second, the self-report measures could be enhanced by qualitative techniques elaborating on the connections between factors. Future studies may benefit from interviews with students eliciting their experiences and uncovering the effect of challenge for instance, or the mediation of collaboration between gameful experience and motivation. Interviews with teachers and observations of teaching via escape room could be beneficial for understanding the challenges they face in implementing ER in class, whether online or face-to-face.

Third, this study offers a measurement adapted from adult gamification showing factor and discriminant validity. Future research should consider expanding the model with additional variables that could better explicate students' experience learning via a digital escape room and how it converges with scores from students' self-report on learning outcomes (Hamari et al., 2016), problem-solving skills (Maker, Zimmerman, Gomez-Arizaga, Pease, & Burke, 2015) or students’ creative thinking (Kim, 2011; Torrance, 2000).

Fourth, our study focused on students from upper elementary grades with small representation of younger students. Future studies could investigate escape room effects in young elementary students separately or choose to focus on secondary school students (middle school and/or high school) to investigate differences between grade levels.
