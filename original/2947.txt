The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship and functioning mechanism between a blended synchronous learning environment (BSLE) and high school students’ cognitive engagement with a mediating role of motivation. This study surveyed 385 high school students enrolled in blended synchronous courses. Building on the quantitative results, 43 students in 23 small groups were selected to be measured in more depth. Results showed that pedagogical affordance was found to be a strong predictor to students’ extrinsic motivation, intrinsic motivation, and deep cognitive engagement. Interestingly, the impact of pedagogical affordance on students’ shallow cognitive engagement was fully mediated by extrinsic motivation. However, statistically, the impact of social and technical affordance on motivation and cognitive engagement was not observed. The follow-up qualitative research yielded seven major themes with regard to pedagogical, social, and technical affordance. These themes helped to understand and interpret those results observed in quantitative phase. This study suggested that instructors and practitioners must take into consideration pedagogical, social, and technical affordance to redesign a motivating and engaging learning environment.

1. Introduction
Both classroom instruction and online learning play a crucial role in facilitating students’ learning performance (Al‐Qahtani and Higgins, 2013; Zhan & Mei, 2013). However, traditional classroom teaching and learning behavior happens at a fixed time and position (Ebner & Gegenfurtner, 2019). Therefore, students with limited access situations, such as suffering pandemics (White, Ramirez, Smith, & Plonowski, 2010), being poor health (Raes, Detienne, Windey, & Depaepe, 2020), expanding enrolments (Raes, Vanneste, et al., 2020), caring for jobs and families (Wang, Huang, & Quek, 2018), would be unable to attend classroom regularly to ensure the continuity of the lecture. Online learning offers students with time and place constraints the expanded access to learning resources and opportunities anytime and anywhere via technology (Stewart, Harlow, & DeBacco, 2011).

Generally, online learning can be grouped into two categories: synchronous and asynchronous delivery (Chen et al., 2005). The synchronous online learning mode has more advantages in contributing to immediate feedback and motivation (Chen et al., 2005) than the asynchronous mode. The asynchronous mode is not constrained by time, which owns more flexibility and does not require instructors and students to present synchronously (Ebner & Gegenfurtner, 2019; Martin, Parker, & Deale, 2012). Nevertheless, both synchronous and asynchronous delivery modes hold their own in-nature drawbacks such as a low level of sense of community and engagement (Cunningham, 2014; Owens, Hardcastle, & Richardson, 2009).

Being increasingly available of information and communication technology, another mode called blended synchronous learning (BSL) is popularly used in recent years (e.g., Bower et al., 2015; Raes, Detienne, et al., 2020; Zydney, McKimmy, Lindberg, & Schmidt, 2019). BSL is a rich media-supported learning method by which remote students can simultaneously participate in the course taught by same instructor and learn with local F2F students together (Bower et al., 2015; Lakhal, Bateman, & Bédard, 2017; Wang, Huang, & Quek, 2018). BSL integrates traditional face-to-face and online learning together (Conklina, Oyarzun, & Barreto, 2017; Lakhal & Khechine, 2016) and therefore, blurs the boundary between the two learning modes (Abdous and Yen, 2010; Raes, Detienne, et al., 2020; Zydney et al., 2019). On the other hand, a blended synchronous learning environment (BSLE) is different from fully face-to-face and online learning environments as they combine both of them (Conklina et al., 2017). As a result, BSL seems to contribute to more flexible and engaging learning environments for students as compared to fully online or face-to-face environments (Raes, Detienne, et al., 2020; Zydney et al., 2019). Although a few studies have been conducted based on a BSLE, most are qualitative research (Raes, Detienne, et al., 2020) focused on the process of designing and implementing a BSLE (e.g., Wang et al., 2018; Wang & Huang, 2018; Wang, Quek, & Hu, 2017; Zydney, Warner, & Angelone, 2020) or the experiences of instructors and students (e.g., Stewart et al., 2011; Szeto & Cheng, 2016). Furthermore, the settings of existing research about the BSLE are mostly higher education (Rehn, Maor, & McConney, 2016; Yang, Yu, & Chen, 2019). Few studies in primary or secondary education settings have been conducted with an empirical research method to investigate the factors influencing students’ engagement based on a BSLE.

Learning engagement is defined as a multifaceted concept including cognitive, behavioral, and emotional aspects, in which cognitive engagement is related to the level of investment in learning ranging from rote memory to in-depth processing (Fredricks, Blumenfeld, & Paris, 2004). Cognitive engagement is an important component of school engagement and is strong associated with academic achievement (van Rooij, Jansen, & van de Grift, 2017). Therefore, it is meaningful for instructors and practitioners to understand the relationship between the BSLE and cognitive engagement in order to design a favorable BSLE to afford students' cognitive engagement and deep learning. Much evidence has revealed that students' motivation is positively linked to cognitive engagement in science contexts and other traditional learning settings (Ben-Eliyahu et al., 2018; Bircan & Sungur, 2016; Putarek, Rovan, & Pavlin-Bernardić, 2019; Tas, 2016; Tas, Subaşı, & Yerdelen, 2019; Wang & Eccles, 2013). For instance, Wang and Eccles (2013) indicated that students’ cognitive engagement could be predicted by school learning environments with the mediating role of achievement motivation. Given the promising value of the BSLE to future lifelong learning way (Raes, Detienne, et al., 2020), there is a strong need to conceptualize the effect of motivation to cognitive engagement in a BSLE.

To address the research gap mentioned above, this study was designed to explore the relationships among a BSLE, motivation, and cognitive engagement in a secondary education setting.

2. Theoretical framework
2.1. Blended synchronous learning environment
According to the location situated of remote students, the BSLE could be framed into two types that one refers to the learning modality that both local F2F and remote students synchronously participate in a same course from physical classrooms located in different schools. The other refers to that local F2F students follow the learning activity from a physical classroom while remote students simultaneously follow the learning activity via Internet from multiple places such as homes or work places (Raes, Detienne, et al., 2020). Whether remote students choose to participate in the course from a physical classroom or via network from multiple places of their own choice holds its relative merits and drawbacks. For instance, attending a course from multiple places contributes to particular flexibility and access for students who have home and work commitments (Wang & Huang, 2018). This modality, however, causes lacked learning atmosphere compared to following the course together from a physical classroom or learning center (Wang, Huang, & Quek, 2018). Also, students situating in separately distributed sites are given less supervision owning to the lack of presence of instructors ( Raes, Detienne, et al., 2020; Raes, Vanneste, et al., 2020). Gillies (2008) claimed that the physical presence of instructors would make students focused and engaged. Divanoglou, Chance-Larsen, Fleming, and Wolfe (2018), furthermore, suggested that instructors at both sites should stay in the classroom all the time even though the session is conducted by the instructor located at a remote campus. In addition, Anastasiades et al. (2010) stated that the school plays a significant role as a socialization agent in developing friendship for students and the BSLE with dual-campus or dual-classroom mode broadens the opportunity and access to learning for remote students while maintaining this advantage. Furthermore, empirical evidence has been found that there is no significant difference on students’ grade and satisfaction among the three methods: traditional F2F classroom, remote physical classroom, and learning at home or work (Abdous and Yoshimura, 2010).

A favorable learning environment should be a combination of pedagogical, social, and technical elements (Kirschner, Strijbos, Kreijns, & Beers, 2004; Wang, 2008, 2009). Kirschner et al. (2004) reported that what is needed for a friendly designed online collaborative learning environment is the affordance of educational, social, and technical parts. In this research, affordance was described as the perceived and actual properties of the thing which determined how the thing could be used (Norman, 1988, p. 9). And the affordance also provided a theoretical framework for designing and evaluating technology-supported learning environments (Kirschner et al., 2004). Grounded on this, Wang (2008, 2009) presented a generic pedagogy, social interaction and technology (PST) model for guiding the design of technology-mediated teaching and learning environments. The pedagogical component means using sound teaching strategies to encourage teaching and learning (Kirschner et al., 2004; Wang, 2008). The social component refers to the perceived properties of a learning environment which can encourage students to engage in social interaction (Kirschner et al., 2004; Wang, 2009). The technical component focuses on the usability of technology-mediated learning environments that determines if a task can be accomplished in an efficient and effective way, which is related to the level of accomplishment of pedagogical and social components (Kirschner et al., 2004; Wang, 2008). In recent studies, the PST model has been widely applied to design and evaluate a BSLE (e.g., Wang et al., 2017; Wang, Huang, & Quek, 2018; Wang & Huang, 2018). However, there is still a lack of an empirical study on investigating the PST model in a BSLE.

2.2. Cognitive engagement
Cognitive engagement refers to the level of investment in learning with self-regulated or strategic learning (Fredricks et al., 2004). According to the degree of processing strategies used and effort exerted to materials, the concept of cognitive engagement can be defined as two components (deep and shallow) (Greene, 2015). Deep cognitive engagement involves high-order or meaningful processing strategy, while shallow cognitive engagement involves more mechanical memorization strategies and other rote processing actions (e.g., rereading class notes) (Xie, Heddy, & Greene, 2019). As opposed to shallow cognitive engagement, deep cognitive engagement develops the connection between new material and prior knowledge and involves the creation of more complex knowledge structure (Greene, 2015; Ravindran, Greene, & DeBacker, 2005). Additionally, evidence has shown that deep cognitive engagement has positive effect on learning performance, while the effect of shallow cognitive engagement on learning performance is negative (Greene & Miller, 1996). Nevertheless, in some learning situations, both deep and shallow cognitive engagement are needed for facilitating learning achievement (Greene & Miller, 1996).

2.3. Motivation
Motivation is defined as the internal state that initiates, directs, and sustains behaviors (Woolfolk, 2016). There are many relevant theories of motivation attempting to explain the motivational behavior from specific perspectives (e.g., attribution theory, expectancy–value theory, achievement goal theory, self-determination theory, and so forth) (Anderman, 2020). Self-determination theory (SDT) explains individual motivational behavior from the humanistic perspective that interprets the motivation as “the need for self-determination” (Woolfolk, 2016, p. 472). Supportive environments for the needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness have facilitated effect on individual motivation (Ryan & Deci, 2020). In regards to types of motivation, the most classic distinction is between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation (Ryan & Deci, 2000). Intrinsic motivation drives activities for individual natural interest and satisfaction, while extrinsic motivation refers to doing an activity for some separable outcomes rather than inherent enjoyment (Ryan and Deci, 2000; Ryan & Deci, 2020). Nonetheless, SDT claims that most individual behaviors are aroused by multiple types of motivation (Ryan & Deci, 2020).

2.4. Relationship among BSLE, motivation, and cognitive engagement
Learning environments are commonly associated with motivation (Baeten et al., 2013; Bekele, 2010). In this study, the BSLE is conceptualized as a combination of pedagogical, social, and technical elements. Previous studies were extensively conducted for testing the relationship between the perception of pedagogical, social, and technical perspectives of a learning environment and motivation (e.g., Baker, 2010; Huang, 2017; Lee & Koszalka, 2016; Tao, 2009). For instance, Baker (2010) indicated that students' perception of teaching presence played a significant predictive role to their motivation in an online learning environment. Huang (2017) revealed that social presence significantly affected students' intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in using messaging service, and also found that the perceived ease of use of a technology positively predicted students' intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to use it. Therefore, the present study assumes that the pedagogical, social, and technical elements of a learning environment are positive predictors to both students’ intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.

With regard to the cognitive engagement, Lee and Koszalka (2016) investigated the relationship between the implementation of instructional design principles and students' cognitive engagement with the mediating role of goals. Results indicated that the implementation of instructional design principles positively predicts students' deep cognitive strategy. Zhang, Lin, Zhan, and Ren (2016) found that teaching presence had a positively direct effect on learners' deep processing strategies. Jin and Shin (2012) revealed that the instructor's feedback to students' answering had significant effects on both students' deep and shallow cognitive strategy use, and learning efforts. Rashid and Asghar (2016) explored the relationships among technology use, self-directed learning, student engagement, and academic performance. Results showed that technology use directly predicts students' cognitive engagement and self-directed learning. Therefore, this study hypothesizes that the pedagogical, social, and technical affordance of a sound learning environment would be positively related to students' deep and shallow cognitive engagement.

Motivation and engagement are closely related to each other and the former could be transformed into the latter under some friendly supportive conditions (Kim, Park, Cozart, & Lee, 2015). A few studies also found a significant relationship between motivational factors and cognitive engagement in traditional learning settings (e.g., Lee & Koszalka, 2016; Ravindran et al., 2005; Walker, Greene, & Mansell, 2006). For instance, Walker et al. (2006) revealed that extrinsic motivation positively predicted shallow cognitive engagement and intrinsic motivation significantly contributed to meaningful cognitive engagement. Lee and Koszalka (2016) demonstrated that both intrinsic goal orientation and extrinsic goal orientation led to the positive effect of the predictor on deep and surface cognitive strategy use. Hence, this study hypothesizes that both the extrinsic and intrinsic motivation has positive effects on deep and shallow cognitive engagement.

2.5. Hypotheses
Previous studies showed that there are significant relationships among learning environments, motivation, and cognitive engagement. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships among a BSLE (Pedagogical, social, and technical affordance), learning motivation, and cognitive engagement. The research model is illustrated in Fig. 1. The hypotheses are as follows:

Hypothesis 1

Pedagogical affordance has direct effects on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and deep and shallow cognitive engagement.

Hypothesis 2

Social affordance has direct effects on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and deep and shallow cognitive engagement.

Hypothesis 3

Technical affordance has direct effects on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and deep and shallow cognitive engagement.

Hypothesis 4

Intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation have direct effects on deep and shallow cognitive engagement.

3. Methodology
3.1. Context
A BSL program was launched from 2017 in the West High School located in Qinghai, an undeveloped province in western China. This program gave remote and rural students access to high-quality learning sessions from a remote synchronous classroom via videoconferencing. The BSL program consisted of three parts as shown in Fig. 2, including one central classroom, some remote classrooms, and one third-party service company. The central classroom is located in Chengdu, a developed city in western China, which possesses rich high-quality learning resources. The remote classrooms are from remote and rural area in western China, and West High School in this study is one of them. A third-party service company provides support to troubleshoot technical problem. In this program, both instructors and students situated in remote and central classrooms. The instructor in the central classroom gave lectures to one central classroom and about twenty-five remote classroom simultaneously. The instructor in each remote classroom mainly helped with remote classroom management and supervision. As there were too many remote students in the BSLE, the students both in central and remote sites could only interact with their peers in the same local classroom. In addition, although the central instructor could ask remotes students to answer questions, s/he seldomly did this. The remote students cannot ask the central instructor questions directly but their questions and feedbacks could be conveyed to the central instructor with the help of the third-party service company. After the session of BSL, the remote instructor would make further explanation to what the remote students confused or were difficult to understand in BSL courses. Fig. 3 provides a snapshot of a remote classroom.

3.2. Quantitative phase
3.2.1. Participants
The participants in this study consisted of 385 students from the West High School. The students were purposely selected for three reasons. First, the average age of this cohort of participants were about 16 years old, and therefore, they owned high level of judgement on the items of instruments and the BSLE, which provided authentic reliability of the response. Second, this cohort of participants enrolled all the learning sessions of six semesters and all subjects were conducted with BSL methods. Thus, they possessed rich learning experience of the BSLE. Third, applying BSL for addressing urban–rural and eastern-western divide in education in China was a high priority. Therefore, continuing with a longitudinal research about learning experience and achievement of the participants can be ensured in the future.

The incomplete responses were omitted from data analysis. There was 342 valid response obtained and the response rate was 88.8%. Among the valid responses, there were roughly twice as many females as males (male 32.7% and female 67.3%), which well represented the overall situation of high school students in China. The grade levels were evenly distributed (10th grade 50.3% and 11th grade 49.7%). The average age of the participants was 16 years old.

3.2.2. Instruments
The survey in this study collected participants' demographic information, pedagogical, social, and technical affordance of the BSLE, students’ motivation, and cognitive engagement. All the items were measured with a five-point Likert-type scale, ranging from “1-Strong Disagree” to “5-Strong Agree”.

3.2.2.1. Affordance of BSLE scale
The affordance of the BSLE consists of pedagogical, social, and technical domains. Teaching and social presence subscales were adapted from the Community of Inquiry Instrument (CoII; Arbaugh et al., 2008) to measure the pedagogical and social affordance, respectively. All the items were modified to fit into the specific learning setting by adding background information of the BSLE. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted on all items of teaching and social presence subscales. Then, six items of teaching presence subscale and four items of social presence subscale were extracted because their factor loadings were above 0.60, fulfilling the criterion suggested by Chin (1998). Technical affordance scale was adapted from Perceived Usefulness of Information Technology (PUIT; Davis, 1989). The background information of the BSLE was integrated into the PUIT scale to fit into this study. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted on the full items of the PUIT scale, and five items were selected whose factor loadings were above 0.60. The internal consistency coefficients (Cronbach's alpha) of pedagogical, social, and technical affordance were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.85, respectively.

3.2.2.2. Learning motivation scale
In this study, learning motivation scale consisted of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation scales were adapted from Intrinsic Motivation for Knowledge (IMK) and Extrinsic Motivation of Identified Regulation (EMID) subscales of Academic Motivation Scale (AMS; Utvær & Haugan, 2016), respectively. The original survey scales were modified to fit into specific settings by adding the background information of the BSLE. Four items of IMK scale and three items of EMID scale were selected for this study because the results of confirmatory factor analysis showed that their factor loadings were above 0.60. The internal consistency coefficients (Cronbach's alpha) of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation were 0.85 and 0.85, respectively.

3.2.2.3. Cognitive engagement scale
All 11 items of Deep Strategy Use (DSU) subscale and Shallow Processing Strategy Use (SPSU) subscale were adapted from Cognitive Engagement Subscale (CES; Miller, Greene, Montalvo, Ravindran, & Nichols, 1996) to measure deep cognitive engagement and shallow cognitive engagement, respectively. The background information of the BSLE was added into the original items to fit into this study. Based on results of confirmatory factor analysis, four items of DSU subscale and four items of SPSU subscale were selected for this study. The internal consistency coefficients (Cronbach's alpha) of deep and shallow cognitive engagement were 0.70 and 0.73, respectively. Appendix A presented all the items.

3.2.3. Data collection and analysis
The data was collected via WJX, www.wjx.cn/, a widely used online surveying tool. SPSS 23.0 and Mplus 8.3 statistical tools were applied for data analysis. Specifically, the descriptive statistic was first implemented. Then, confirmatory factor analysis was conducted for testing reliability and validity of the measurement model. Finally, structural equation modelling (SEM) was analyzed to evaluate the fit indices of the structural model in Mplus.

3.3. Qualitative phase
3.3.1. Participants
In order to further explore and interpret the results from the quantitative phase, a follow-up survey with open-ended questions was conducted after the initial quantitative research (Creswell & Clark, 2017). A total of 43 students from the West High School was purposefully invited to participated in this qualitative phase. They were selected because they in the third-year, possessed rich learning experience in the BSLE, and participated in the initial quantitative phase. In order to ensure the depth and diversity of views, an open-ended questionnaire was completed by the participants in groups. They could choose one or two partners to finish the questionnaire together. Finally, 23 valid responses were obtained, in which one was completed by three students, four completed by individual students, and the rest completed by two students. The average age of these participants was 17. All the participants possessed over two-year learning experience in the BSLE.

3.3.2. Questionnaire protocol development
The protocol development of open-ended questionnaire in qualitative phase was grounded on the results of initial quantitative research. Two open-ended questions explored students' perspective on social affordance of the BSLE. Two other open-ended questions explored students’ perspectives on pedagogical and technical affordance, respectively. The questionnaire protocol was pilot tested among ten students and four experienced experts in educational technology with an average of ten years in teaching and research experience, and one of them possessed five-year learning and teaching experience in America, and also three-year research experience in China. Based on this, the questionnaire protocol was modified slightly and developed for the second phase of research. The questionnaire protocol was presented in Appendix A.

3.3.3. Data collection and analysis
Data was collected in September 2020. The research ethics were rigidly considered and all the responses were completed voluntarily and anonymously. The questionnaire was uploaded to the online surveying tool, https://www.wjx.cn/, and then distributed to students during the break of the class. The collected data was analyzed through three-phase constructing grounded theory coding. In the phase of initial coding, the data was coded line by line with an open attitude to all possible theoretical directions (Charmaz, 2006). In the phase of focused coding, the initial codes were further analyzed to find out the most significant and frequent codes to generate some more general categories which were able to interpret larger segments of data than line-by-line or word-by-word codes. In the phase of axial coding, the relevant categories were integrated and grouped to establish a smaller number of common themes (Merriam, 2009). The constant comparative method (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) was adopted during the whole coding process to compare the codes and categories, to determine similarities and differences, and thus to portray their relationships. The coding process was conducted by two researchers independently and the disputed themes were negotiated through going back and forth between data and codes until a consensus was reached.

4. Results
4.1. Quantitative phase
4.1.1. Assessment of measurement model
In this study, the measurement model was assessed by item reliability, composite reliability, convergence validity, and discriminant validity. Specifically, the item reliability and convergence validity were measured with square of item factor loading (R2) and average variance extracted (AVE), respectively. Table 1 illustrates that all factor loadings were greater than 0.6 and all P value of those were statistically significant. Also, R2 of most items exceeded 0.5 and some were acceptable. composite reliability (CR) of all constructs ranged from 0.71 to 0.86, exceeding the recommended cut-off value 0.6 (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988), which indicated that the items of each construct had better internal consistency. Most AVE values were greater than 0.5, meeting the recommended criteria 0.5 (Fornell & Larcker, 1981). Although AVE values of shallow cognitive engagement (SC) and deep cognitive engagement (DC) constructs were slightly less than 0.5, all their CR values exceeded 0.70, which indicated that their convergence validity was acceptable (Lam, 2012). Table 2 shows that the square roots of the AVE of constructs were mostly greater than the correlation coefficients of related constructs, which indicated that the discriminant validity of the measurement model was adequate in this study.

4.1.2. Assessment of structural model
The structural model was assessed using the chi square value by the degrees of freedom (χ2/df), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), the comparative fit index (CFI), the Tucker–Lewis Index (TLI), and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) in this study. The recommended cutoff values of model fit indices were: χ2/df < 3, RMSEA ≤0.06, CFI ≥0.90, TLI ≥0.90, and SRMR <0.10 (Meyers, Gamst, & Guarino, 2016). The results of SEM showed that the hypothesized model could fit data well: χ2 = 631.31, χ2/df = 1.91, RMSEA = 0.05, CFI = 0.93, TLI = 0.92, SRMR = 0.06.

Table 3 shows the hypotheses testing results for direct path coefficients of initial structural model. The results demonstrated that technical affordance only significantly predicted deep cognitive engagement (β = 0.236, t = 2.252, p < 0.05), and its predictive effects on extrinsic/intrinsic motivation and shallow cognitive engagement were not significant. Both motivational variables (extrinsic and intrinsic) and cognitive engagement variables (shallow and deep) were not predicted by social affordance. Therefore, Hypothesis 2 was not supported. It is worth noting that pedagogical affordance was a positive statistically significant predictor to students’ extrinsic motivation (β = 0.385, t = 3.277, p < 0.001), intrinsic motivation (β = 0.506, t = 4.531, p < 0.001), and deep cognitive engagement (β = 0.441, t = 3.378, p < 0.001), whereas its effect on shallow cognitive engagement was insignificant. Additionally, extrinsic motivation predicted shallow cognitive engagement significantly (β = 0.152, t = 2.089, p < 0.05), but its effect on deep cognitive engagement was insignificant. Intrinsic motivation predicted deep cognitive engagement significantly (β = 0.159, t = 1.943, p < 0.05), whereas its effect on shallow cognitive engagement was insignificant.

In order to keep the model concise, social affordance and other non-significant paths were removed from the initial model. The SEM results indicated that the modified model could fit the data well: χ2 = 469.388, χ2/df = 1.92, RMSEA = 0.05, CFI = 0.94, TLI = 0.93, SRMR = 0.08. Fig. 4 illustrates the modified model with standardized path coefficients after reexamination. The results of SEM showed that pedagogical affordance had statistically significant effects on extrinsic motivation (β = 0.384, t = 4.899, p < 0.001), intrinsic motivation (β = 0.560, t = 6.644, p < 0.001), and deep cognitive engagement (β = 0.391, t = 3.486, p < 0.001). Extrinsic motivation significantly predicted shallow cognitive engagement (β = 0.259, t = 3.743, p < 0.001). However, technical affordance and intrinsic motivation did not have statistically significant effects on deep cognitive engagement. Therefore, Hypothesis 3 was not supported. Additionally, Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 4 were partially supported respectively. More specifically, in Hypothesis 1, the effects of pedagogical affordance on extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, and deep cognitive engagement were supported but the predicting power of pedagogical affordance to shallow cognitive engagement was not supported. In Hypothesis 4, only the effect of extrinsic motivation on shallow cognitive engagement was supported.

4.1.3. Mediating effect analysis
From Fig. 4, significant positive effects of pedagogical affordance on extrinsic motivation, and extrinsic motivation on shallow cognitive engagement were observed. Therefore, a bootstrap test, further, was conducted with 2000-time sampling at the confidence level of 95% to examine the mediating effects of extrinsic motivation. Table 4 illustrates the mediating testing results of the final modified model. As shown in Table 4, the indirect effect of extrinsic motivation on predictive power of pedagogical affordance to shallow cognitive engagement was statistically significant, which indicated that extrinsic motivation played a fully mediating role in pedagogical affordance on shallow cognitive engagement.

4.2. Qualitative phase
The main emergent themes related to remote students’ perspective on pedagogical, social, and technical affordance were as follows: (1) changes of scope, knowledge, and learning motivation, (2) learning tasks were too difficult and beyond prior knowledge, (3) development of advanced learning strategies, (4) low social interaction between the instructor and students, (5) peer pressure from the excellent students at the central site (6) perceived drawbacks of the synchronous technology, and (7) flexibility and accessibility of the synchronous technology.

4.2.1. Students’ perspective on pedagogical affordance
4.2.1.1. Changes of scope, knowledge, and learning motivation
Almost all of participating remote students shared that enrolling in the courses lectured in the BSLE broadened their scope and promoted their level of knowledge. For instance, the remote students in Group 23 stated: “In the teaching process, in addition to the content in the textbook, the central instructor also expanded a lot of related knowledge outside of the book. The expanded content was more esoteric and the instructor's teaching speed was faster, but at the same time, we have also expanded our scope, increased knowledge, and tasted the excellence of remote school”. The remote students in Group 18 also explained that “the central instructor adopted very interesting learning methods, which can arouse the motivation for learning, and the classroom atmosphere is active”. These statements revealed that the remote students acknowledged the pedagogical affordance of the BSLE that the central instructors' instruction sessions were interesting and of high quality. Their scope had been expanded, and they had learned lots of knowledge in an active way. Thus, their extrinsic and intrinsic motivation got fostered, and had a higher level of deep engagement, as revealed by the quantitative phase.

4.2.1.2. Learning tasks were too difficult and beyond prior knowledge
The second frequent comment on the pedagogical design of the BSLE was that the learning tasks were too difficult and far beyond their prior knowledge. For instance, some remote students explained,

“The classroom atmosphere was good at the central site and the central students were highly motivated to communicate with the instructor. However, our classmates in remote site mostly owned poorer prior knowledge compared with students at the central site. Moreover, less attention was paid to our prior knowledge and comprehension to the content, and the learning activity was too hard for us, which caused many problems such as remote students' inattention and less motivation in class” (students in Group 21).

“The pace of the Math instructor was too fast in first semester but the level of our prior knowledge was very low. Consequently, there was a lot of knowledge that we cannot understand. Hence, we hoped that our instructors in the remote site can lead us to review what we have learned before.” (students in Group 7).

The remote students considered some of the learning content delivered by the central instructors were beyond their prior knowledge, so the learning tasks were too difficult for them. The gap between the task difficulty and the remote students’ knowledge might be even enlarged in some specific subjects such as Mathematics and Physics. As some remote students explained: “The lessons delivered by the central instructor was excellent, but due to our low prior knowledge, science subjects such as Mathematics and Physics were hard to understand” (students in Group 6). This caused their distraction from learning. Moreover, some remote students “felt frustrated when having classes with such excellent students having much better performance.” The perceived difficulty and frustration had negative influence on their motivation, especially the extrinsic motivation such as performing better than others. This could be further explained the mediating effect of extrinsic motivation between pedagogical affordance and shallow engagement.

4.2.1.3. Development of advanced learning strategies
Although having synchronous classes together with the excellent instructor and students at the central site faced a lot of difficulties, remote students reported that they had gained advanced learning strategies. As some remote students stated,

“… the central instructor gave us great inspiration in the way of thinking. In addition, many novel types of questions and corresponding solving methods were obtained in blended synchronous courses” (students in Group 17).

“We acquired some leaning strategies. For example, we would try different methods to solve one problem” (students in Group 9).

What brought the remote students a sense of achievement included the way of thinking, and the problem-solving skills, which were also gained from the central instructors’ instruction in the BSLE. The development of advanced learning strategies also enhanced their learning motivation and engagement.

4.2.2. Students’ perspective on social affordance
4.2.2.1. Low social interaction between the instructor and students
The students complained that there were little or no interaction between the central instructor and remote students, central students and remote students, although the central instructor had active interaction with central students. As stated,

“There was no interactive equipment in the remote site. Therefore, we just watched live videos, listened to the central instructor's instruction, and watched interactions between the central instructor and the central students” (students in Group 22).

In addition, the questions the central instructor asked were always beyond remote students' knowledge. This further decreased their social presence and sense of participation. As responded,

“Most of the questions thrown by the central instructor were innovative and can greatly expand our scope, but the threshold of participation was too high for us, which led to no learning experience and social presence. We hoped this issue could be improved” (students in Group 7).

4.2.2.2. Peer pressure from the excellent students at the central site
According to the remote students, synchronously participating in the same course with excellent students at the central site brought them peer pressure. As stated,

“In class, the questions raised by the central instructor are very meaningful. Although it was a little difficult for us to answer these questions sometime, the students at the central site were very active in participating in the learning activities, and their learning attitudes also worth learning” (students in Group 8).

“The excellent performance of the central students set a good example for us, gave us the motivation to learn, and let us understand our own shortcomings that needed to be improved in the future. And we also learned a lot from their multiple views.” (students in Group 4).

These statements demonstrated that the peer pressure stimulated the remote students’ sense of competition, and motivated them to work hard. The excellent students at the central site also made a good example for the remote students.

4.2.3. Students’ perspective on technical affordance
4.2.3.1. Perceived drawbacks of the synchronous technology
Many remote students shared that synchronous communication had poor stability, which was easily affected by bad weather. For instance, some remote students indicated,

“The stability of the live video was easily affected by the weather, and sometimes it was easy to be interrupted or stuck, which brought us bad learning experience. Also, there was severe network delay sometimes, resulting in some content being unacceptable in time and affecting learning efficiency” (students in Group 4).

“The stability of the communication was insufficient in rain and snow. Sometimes the central instructor's microphone was silent, and sometimes the sound of students' responses was low. In addition, the resolution was too low when playing videos” (students in Group 19).

In addition, watching the screen for a long time can cause harm to their eyesight. Some remote students stated that “In our class, the proportion of myopia was rising” (Group 15).

4.2.3.2. Flexibility and accessibility of the synchronous technology
The remote students considered that the biggest benefit of synchronous communication technology was that it could provide remote and rural students expanded access to high-quality learning resources of developed areas, because the quality of education and learning resources in remote areas were relatively weak. It could be seen from the following quote:

“The synchronous communication technology was highly advanced and it gave us an opportunity to participate in a high-quality course to learn together with the excellent students and their instructor at the central site.” (students in Group 3).

“The synchronous conferencing technology enabled us to experience distance teaching. And it was of great significance for realizing educational resources sharing and improving the quality of education in remote and rural areas” (students in Group 16).

However, the flexibility of the synchronous conferencing technology in West High School was limited. For instance, some students indicated,

“The synchronous multimedia software can only work on the PC side. We hoped that the technical department could upgrade the software so that it would be used on the mobile phone, which would facilitate fragmented learning and improve learning flexibility” (students in Group 6).

5. Discussion
The purpose of this study was to explore the factors contributing to remote students' cognitive engagement in a BSLE. To respond this, a mixed methods study was implemented. SEM was adopted to quantitatively test the relationships among the BSLE, students’ motivation, and their cognitive engagement. Then, a follow-up qualitative open-question survey was employed to further interpret the quantitative findings.

This study found that pedagogical affordance had positively predictive effects on both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. The remote students who perceived high level of pedagogical affordance in the BSLE would result in high intrinsic and extrinsic learning motivation. Conversely, if they perceived low level of pedagogical affordance, they would present insufficient learning motivation. This result was in line with Baker (2010)'s research showing that students' perception of teaching presence was a significant predictor of motivation, as teaching presence could be reflected by the pedagogical presence. Moreover, this study extended the previous research that it found students' perceived pedagogical affordance was associated with both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. This finding also echoed the previous study which claimed that learning environments being short of pedagogical affordance, social affordance, or technological affordance would disappoint students and instructors, undermine their motivation, and ultimately result in no learning (Kirschner et al., 2004). This finding also provides empirical evidence based upon qualitative data on how pedagogical affordance of the BSLE fostered motivation from the remote students' perspectives. The pedagogical affordance of the BSLE, such as the excellent instructional resources, active learning activities, and the atmosphere, all were considered to motivate remote students to be engaged in learning.

This study found that pedagogical affordance had a positively direct effect on deep cognitive engagement. It means the remote students who perceived high pedagogical affordance in the BSLE tended to adopt meaningful processing strategies. This finding was in concurrence with Zhang et al. (2016)'s research confirming that teaching presence had a positive effect on deep cognitive engagement behaviors, such as constructive and interactive engagement. It also supported Lee and Koszalka (2016)'s study which revealed that students' perceived effective instruction was positively related to their use of deep cognitive strategy. Furthermore, qualitative results had a more in-depth interpretation of this finding that remote students in the BSLE developed their advanced learning strategies from central instructor's lectures and thereafter advanced their deep cognitive engagement toward tasks. This finding suggests that who teaches the course in central site should possess richer pedagogical knowledge than the counterpart in remote site for reaching the balanced allocation of educational resources between urban and rural areas.

Extrinsic motivation had positively a direct effect on shallow cognitive engagement. This finding was in accordance with the previous studies showing that extrinsic motivational factors played a positively predictive role on shallow or surface cognitive strategy use (Albaili, 1998; Lee & Koszalka, 2016; Sedaghat, Abedin, Hejazi, & Hassanabadi, 2011; Walker et al., 2006). It is noteworthy that the effect of extrinsic motivation on deep cognitive engagement was not supported. This finding provided empirical evidence to further verify Walker et al. (2006)'s research demonstrating that students' extrinsic motivation was positively related to their shallow cognitive engagement. Interestingly, the mediating role of extrinsic motivation in the predicting power of pedagogical affordance to shallow cognitive engagement was observed. This meant that pedagogical affordance could predict extrinsic motivation, which in turn predicted shallow cognitive engagement. The qualitative results demonstrated that the remote students' perceived peer pressure brought by having classes with excellent students synchronously influenced their extrinsic motivation. They might be frustrated and demotivated when they found the students at the central site performed better than themselves. However, the peer pressure aroused their sense of competition, and they worked hard and had a higher level of shallow engagement. In this sense, extrinsic motivation mediated pedagogical affordance and shallow engagement. Therefore, this finding suggests that the external reward should be carefully used by instructors in their pedagogical design, as it would contribute to students' extrinsic motivation and thereafter encourage surface cognitive strategy rather than deep strategy use.

However, this study also found that the predicting powers of social and technical affordance to motivation and cognitive engagement were not statistically supported. This study yielded inconsistent findings with previous research claiming that the presence of social interaction and perceived technology use towards innovative technologies were associated with students' motivation (Huang, 2017; Tao, 2009). Qualitative results provided some empirical evidences. For the social affordance, remote students’ perceived poor social interaction among remote students, central students, and central instructors may decrease the level of learning motivation and cognitive investment on tasks, which could, to some extent, account for the weak relationships between social affordance, motivation, and cognitive engagement. For technical affordance, technical problems such as latency, clarity, and stability presumably limited pedagogical and social affordance, and in turn discourage students from being motivated and engaged in activities.

Furthermore, seven major themes emerged in qualitative phase, to some extent, can be explained by the implementation of the BSLE. For instance, developed economic conditions, rich high-quality learning resources, and instructors with excellent instructional strategies, scope, and knowledge possessed by the central school could, to some extent, interpret why remote students perceived that participating in sessions of BSL is able to broaden their scope, promote their level of knowledge, stimulate their learning motivation, and develop their advanced learning strategies. However, some issues compromised the implementation and therefore led to bad learning experiences. For instance, as there were too many remote students synchronously participating in the BSLE, the central instructor hardly offered remote students opportunities to ask questions or to interact with them, which brought about low social interaction between the central instructor and remote students, central students and remote students. Additionally, the central instructor paid more attention to what the central students needed, such as instructional strategies and learning tasks. Therefore, remote students perceived that learning contents delivered in the BSLE were too difficult and beyond their prior knowledge, which thereafter might pose a threat to remote students’ experience, motivation, and engagement. Finally, the technical equipment used in the BSLE was still relatively simple in function. Although the delivery of voice, image, and video was supported, the flexibility of the synchronous conferencing technology was still limited as remote students said in their feedback in qualitative phase.

The findings also contribute some implications for practitioners in the field of education to design and implement a blended synchronous learning course for promoting the balanced allocation of high-quality learning resources. In terms of the pedagogical aspect, specially designed instructional strategies, such as employing central instructors with richer pedagogical knowledge, customizing learning content according to the level of prior knowledge of remote students, paying more attention to remote students, providing remote students more opportunities to ask questions and to participate in discussions, and cultivating intimacy between central instructors and remote students, should be considered seriously as crucial factors to motivate remote students to be engaged in deep learning. In terms of the social aspect, enhancing interaction among central instructors, remote students, and central students will encourage their sense of relatedness and in turn stimulate remote students’ sense of competition and engagement. Therefore, some synchronous and asynchronous interactive tools should be used in blended synchronous learning courses. In terms of the technical aspect, robustness and stability of the synchronous videoconferencing system without technical problems should be given high priority because the implementation of instructional strategies and social interaction are deeply determined by technical parts of a BSLE. Overall, this study suggests that for the design of a BSLE, the stability of technology, a supportive and comfortable learning environment for interaction, and a sound pedagogical design providing equivalent focus for students at both sites should be taken into consideration.

6. Limitations, future research, and conclusions
Several limitations should be noted in this study. First, the sample size of the participants is insufficient to generalize the conclusion to other blended synchronous learning environments. More students and schools of different areas should be selected for a better generalizability of the conclusion. Second, despite going through two phases in this study, all the variables are self-reported at a single time. A longitudinal design can be employed in the future research to further test the causal relationships among the measured variables. Third, engagement owns a multifaceted nature. The present study only investigates the factors influencing students’ cognitive engagement. Future research should add to the other factors of engagement such as behavioral and emotional parts.

Blended synchronous courses has a promising potential to extend the access to high-quality learning resources. However, remote students are facing the problem of low cognitive engagement. The present study tests the relationships among affordance of a BSLE, motivation, and cognitive engagement. Results demonstrate the importance of pedagogical affordance to students’ motivation and their cognitive engagement. To design a supportive blended synchronous learning environment, instructors, practitioners, and researchers must take into consideration pedagogical, social, and technical elements.
