Learning to code and to develop a range of digital skills has been purported to help nations remain economically competitive. Development of these skills has been touted as a way to prepare workers for tech jobs and increase their social mobility. However, this focus is quite narrow and does not recognize the benefits of learning to code beyond the economic benefits. In this paper, we present results from a qualitative study of ‘go_girl: code + create’, a multidisciplinary computing program that places the needs of marginalized young women, aged 16–21, who are not in education, employment or training (NEET) at its centre. This study, based on in-depth, semi-structured open-ended interviews of nine participants at the beginning, mid-point and end of the program, examines changes in the self-concepts of these participants. This study demonstrates the role technology can play in facilitating changes in self-concepts and contributes to studies that examine the identity/self-concept of young underrepresented women participating in computing initiatives. Qualitative content analysis was applied to the interview data which revealed enhanced self-concepts in relation to education, career aspirations and technology use over the duration of the program. Participants' aspirations were either broadened or clarified and they began to view themselves as makers and not merely consumers of technology.

1. Introduction
Governments around the world are requiring that computing, including programming, be taught in schools (The Royal Society, 2012; Hubwieser et al., 2015; Smith, 2016; National Innovation and Science Agenda, Australian Government, 2017). Developing computing skills has been promoted as a way of boosting the economy and increasing social mobility (Armoni, 2012; Kohli & Quartz, 2015; Singer, 2017). In non-formal education settings, an increasingly strong emphasis is placed on the enhancement of programming skills in particular, to prepare workers for the “digital transformation of society” (Balanskat & Englehart, 2014, p. 5). These non-formal settings include an ever-increasing number of coding clubs, particularly clubs created to increase opportunities and interest among young girls (e.g. Code.org and GirlsWhoCode) and women in response to the longstanding underrepresentation of women in computer science (CS) (Ashcraft et al., 2017; Lang et al., 2015; Margolis & Fisher, 2002; Meelissen & Drent, 2008; Sax et al., 2017; Varma & Hahn, 2008). For a detailed history of women in computing, barriers and causes of underrepresentation, see Gürer & Camp, 2002; Kelleher & Pausch, 2005; Abbate, 2012; Aspray, 2016; Hicks, 2017; and Blair, 2018. For data pertaining to the underrepresentation of women in the tech-related fields in Europe, see European Commission, 2019.

We agree that more women are needed in computer science, as inclusion of their views, talents and skills will ensure that the field is representative of society. However, as discussed by Davies and Eynon (2018), government agendas tend to focus solely on the national economy, echoing existing research on the broader relationships between computing and economic nationalism (Vitores & Gil-Juárez, 2016). Put simply, an overtly economic motivation results in interventions that are often too “narrow” and “deterministic”, and leaves untouched existing structural inequalities and the conditions that hinder progression, including lack of work experience, lack of soft skills and inability to relocate for jobs (Shadbolt, 2016). Thus, learning to code is not a panacea for increasing the socio-economic status of women, particularly those who are marginalized. This is because marginalized young women (in a UK context often referred to as NEETs - not in education, employment or training) often have complex needs including dealing with the everyday consequences of poverty, mental health issues and childcare responsibilities. So although there are numerous coding clubs, such as Code First Girls (see www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/), Girls Who Code (Saujani, 2017), CompuGirls (Scott & White, 2013) and Black Girls Code (see www.blackgirlscode.com/), aimed at young women, much of the training offered may not be structured to meet the complex needs of those who are living at the margins. In addition, research shows that young people from lower socio-economic status (SES) groups often lack high-quality access to technology as well as sufficient knowledge and abilities to utilize technology in sophisticated ways (Eynon & Geniets, 2015; Livingstone & Helsper, 2007). How do we ensure that this group of women will not continue to be excluded from our increasingly digital society, potentially at risk from digital structural violence? Digital structural violence is understood as the combination of everyday injustices in society, which include issues of health, education and employment as well as other factors like biases in search engines, MOOCs and YouTube, that increase disadvantages for those already at the margins (Winters et al., 2020, p. 3).

To address the broader range of needs for this demographic, we developed go_girl code + create, a community outreach program designed to empower marginalized young women who are NEET, or at risk of becoming NEET, utilizing technology as an integral tool. The program's holistic approach combines social, emotional and psychological development with technological training to facilitate inclusion in the digital society by developing confidence, resilience and a plan to transition into education, employment or training. Critically, the approach, while tailored to participants' needs, does not assume that they are digital natives (Kirschner & van Merriënboer, 2013).

The go_girl code + create program has multiple aspects and in this paper we focus on findings from a qualitative study that examined changes in self-concept among program participants. Our conceptual framework draws from literature on self-concept, particularly research in educational psychology that identifies a reciprocal relationship between self-concept and achievement. We review research investigating self-concept and identity for young underrepresented women participating in computing initiatives. However, few studies investigate computing as an integral tool used to enhance self-concept or identity, perhaps because few technology programs explicitly aim to enhance self-concept. Therefore, our research questions for this study are: What changes were identified in participant narratives related to their self-concepts? What aspects of the program likely contributed to changes in self-concepts? These research questions address an important gap identified by Scott et al. (2015), who reviewed over 50 technology programs for economically disadvantaged or ethnic-minority groups and found that “the vast majority focus exclusively on technical literacy (i.e., programming) and do not mention issues of diversity, community, culture, or identity.”

2. Self-concept in educational psychology
The singular term ‘self-concept’ refers to the total set of cognitive representations that each person has of himself or herself. Within this whole, there are ‘self-concepts’ linked to specific domains such as cognitive abilities, physical appearance, or social status (Pekrun & Stephens, 2015, p. 469). These distinct self-concepts include academic self-concept (Luttenberger et al., 2019). Put another way, self-concept is one's knowledge and perceptions about oneself and these perceptions are “formed through experiences with and interpretation of one's environment (Marsh & Shavelson, 1985, p. 107).

A significant portion of scholarly work on self-concept in educational psychology is focused on the relationship between academic self-concept and achievement. Most of these studies are quantitative, documenting correlations between these variables and causal effects, as demonstrated in Helmke and van Aken (1995) and in the reciprocal effects model (REM) of Marsh and Craven (2006). In fact, not only is enhancing self-concept a vital goal in and of itself but there is a reciprocal relationship between academic self-concept and academic achievement whereby “improved academic self-concepts lead to better performance, and improved performance leads to better academic self-concepts” (Marsh & O'Mara, 2008, p. 549).

Marsh and colleagues (2020) describe multidimensionality (multiple domains of self-concept) as one of the key features of self-concept research. For example, self-concept related to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) subjects may vary independently from other aspects of self-concept. One study found that women's self-concepts in relation to STEM were bolstered when subjects were taught by female experts (Stout et al., 2011). The reciprocal and mutually reinforcing nature of academic self-concept and achievement suggests that educators should ideally integrate work on developing self-concept alongside a focus on academic achievement (Marsh & Craven, 2006, p. 159; Sammons et al., 2016, p.3). This reciprocal relationship is supported by a number of studies (Marsh et al., 2020; Pekrun & Stephens, 2015; Prince & Nurius, 2014; Marsh & Martin, 2011; Marsh & O'Mara, 2008; Marsh & Craven, 2006).

Numerous quantitative studies have established correlations between academic self-concept and academic achievement. However, there is a need for more qualitative studies, particularly related to women and computing, that focus on self-concept and highlight participant voices and narratives. In an overview of 74 peer-reviewed articles, Rüschenpöhler and Markic (2019) found that most science and technology self-concept studies analyse quantitative data and recommend utilizing qualitative data as a way to enhance this research to provide a more rounded view of self-concept. To take two examples: Jackman et al. (2011) conducted both quantitative and qualitative studies examining the big-fish-little-pond effect (BFLPE), whereby equally able students have lower academic self-concept in higher-achieving schools than in lower-achieving schools (see also Marsh, 1987, p. 280; Fang et al., 2018). The qualitative data revealed BFLPE, adding richness to the study not captured by the quantitative data. In a second example, Davidson (2001) examined how learning through adventure, experiences of outdoor education at school, improved boys’ self-concepts. He noted the importance of qualitative methods to capture the meanings participants make of their experiences, suggesting that these meanings go beyond what can be measured quantitatively to reveal improvements in self-concepts.

Moreover, studies that examine the identity/self-concept of young underrepresented women participating in computing initiatives are limited. However, there are a few that stand out in particular: (a) Khan and Luxton-Reilly (2016) review research on how computer science is perceived and argue that including socially relevant activities in early computing courses could increase participation of under-represented groups. They found that course projects that involve real world contributions to the community allowed students to see their work as impactful and resulted in changes to their self-perceptions; (b) DesPortes et al. (2016) study of MoveLab, an educational intervention that teaches African-American and Hispanic girls about computing, as well as dance. They found that forming congruence between these activities and the girls' self-concepts was achieved by creating multiple roles for participation and integrating student values within a socially supportive community. They argue that working to include diverse populations in computing requires understanding how to deal with issues within these groups that may be causing conflicts between their identities in relation to computing and their personal interests and values; (c) Ashcraft et al. (2017) employed a culturally responsive approach to computing (making curricula relevant to students' lived experiences and bringing them on board as stakeholders) in a program for adolescent girls, mostly Black and Latina, with the goal of fostering their identities as technosocial change agents, described as “individuals who can challenge dominant narratives and construct more liberating identities and social relations as they create new technologies” (Ashcraft et al., 2017, p. 234). Through several vignettes, they illustrate how the girls begin to make connections between computing, social justice issues and their own identities. The authors also push against the heavy reliance on quantitative evidence focused on increased ability and interest as a way to measure success in computing. They suggest that utilizing qualitative measures is crucial for assessing students’ likely persistence in computing and understanding how technologies can reinforce or rectify inequities (Ashcraft et al., 2017, p. 248). The four qualitative studies discussed add important dimensions of local context and the lived realities of individuals that bear on the formation and modification of their self-concepts. The current study seeks to contribute to and extend this body of literature that has remained under-researched.

3. The go_girl program: context of the study
go_girl code + create, which began in 2015, is a community outreach program based at the University of Oxford Department of Education, in partnership with the Oxford County Council. The original idea for the program stems from an understanding that the University has a responsibility to engage with the surrounding community in meaningful ways and to support widening access. The program seeks to accomplish this in a fundamentally new way that utilises technology. It seeks to empower young women who are NEET by helping them to clarify and broaden their aspirations, and develop their capabilities in the use of digital tools, media production and coding. The main goal is to help participants develop pathways to independence, which may include careers in coding or tech-related fields or pursuing other training, education or employment.

3.1. Curriculum design and implementation
Designed and delivered by a team of interdisciplinary researchers and supported by program partners, go_girl code + create is not a typical coding club or computing course as it caters to the needs of young women with complex lives. It offers a more holistic approach, incorporating social empowerment, cognitive educational growth, individual psychological empowerment and technological empowerment. These elements work together within an informal, flexible and supportive learning environment tailored to the needs of participants. This innovative, non-traditional approach is well suited for young women who may not have considered pursuing further or higher education. This approach involves engaging participants in four interrelated ways: identifying their values (e.g. intrinsic and monetary) regarding their current career goals and aspirations; exploring and reflecting on their own life stories; building media production skills; and building programming skills focused on creativity and activism for issues important to them.

3.2. Program methods
The yearlong program was designed in four phases. Table 1 details the curriculum topics, which incorporated a reflexive teaching approach flexibly responsive to participants’ needs. A reflexive approach incorporates the use of Experience Based Learning (EBL) techniques (Duarte & Fitzgerald, 2006; Kolb, 2014) which, in the case of go_girl, encourage participants to create projects meaningful to them, allowing them to reflect on their own experiences. EBL involves engaging the whole person, including intellectual and other capacities. Pre-phase work involved personalized outreach and recruitment of participants, conducted by a youth worker from the local county council early intervention service. She recruited young women already receiving council services. The youth worker provided links to social/psychological support for participants and collaborated on the development of the curriculum, contributing ideas for social activities and relational exercises. She co-ran each 3-hour weekly session and helped conduct social development and careers sessions for the young women. The two program creators, along with a teacher and researcher/co-teacher, also participated in planning and delivery.

Phase 1 focused on team building and social development and these activities continued throughout the program. Phase 2 centered on technical skills development with an introduction to coding. In Phase 3, participants worked on projects blending creativity and coding by creating projects (e.g. a website, app, blog or game) based on personal interests and they presented finished projects to an authentic audience (family, education community and industry funders). Lastly, Phase 4 involved preparing for and transitioning the young women into education, employment or training. The youth worker helped participants apply for courses or seek jobs. This phase also provided participants with an opportunity to become go_girl pioneers, helping to develop the curriculum for the next cohort and assist with recruitment. The program received ethical approval from the University of Oxford ethics committee.

During sessions, the young women worked on specific tasks for each program phase. During the first phase, they worked on personal development and goal setting, creating roadmaps detailing the steps and resources needed to achieve their goals. They continued to develop their roadmaps while working on specific technological projects aligned with their stated interests/goals. Projects designed and created by Cohort 1 included a health and lifestyle app, a football fitness website, and a game involving a dinosaur trying to catch food. A curriculum pack which provides an extensive overview of the program, including details on how computers were used and displays of the work of participants, will be available online at https://gogirloxford.org/publications/.

Each participant was provided with a tablet and smart phone to ensure they could work on projects at their own pace beyond the confines of the University. Smart phones were utilized for projects that incorporated the use of photos and also served as a means of communication between staff and participants. Upon completion of the program the devices were theirs to keep, which provided an incentive for completing the program.

3.3. Participants
A unique aspect of the go_girl program is that it reaches a population of marginalized young women frequently excluded in discussions and plans for preparing young people to thrive in a digital society. Participants are between the ages of 16 and 24. They are from non-traditional academic backgrounds and live in areas ofOxfordshire with a high percentage of social housing. Many of them struggle with a variety of issues including lack of self-confidence, learning disabilities; depression, social anxiety, problematic family situations and economic challenges. These issues have had a negative impact on their education and career progression as well as their self-concepts. Table 2, Table 3 provide additional information about participants. Extensive details of their lives were not included to ensure confidentiality.

4. Methodology
We examined the narratives of the participants and constructed an understanding of their points of view as they reflected on their experiences of the go_girl program and how it influenced their lives, with particular focus on changes in their self-concepts related to education, career aspirations, and technology. Our goal was to identify changes in participant narratives related to their self-concepts and to understand which aspects of the program likely contributed to these changes. The methods most appropriate for addressing these research questions were narrative interviews conducted at several points during the program, supplemented by personal interactions and field notes. This approach allowed us to track changes in self-concept descriptions as participants progressed through the program. It also allowed us to identify elements of the program that participants found especially impactful.

4.1. Data sources
Field notes recorded during each weekly session were helpful in documenting and assessing the program's influence on the young women, particularly in terms of changes in self-concept related to education and career aspirations, and how they viewed themselves in relation to technology. Interviews were also conducted with each participant three times during the duration of the program and two months after the end of the program to capture participant experiences of the program at various stages. These interviews serve as the primary source of data for this study.

22 semi-structured open-ended interviews with nine go_girl participants were recorded and transcribed during the first year of the program between November 2015 and August 2016. This was appropriate for our goal of focusing “on the meaning of particular phenomena to the participants” (Robson, 2002, p. 271). The interviews were designed to help construct an understanding of the young women's education and career aspirations, confidence levels, and relationship with technology and to understand the ways in which the go_girl program influenced these domains. Participants were also asked about their access to technology, experiences of technology use in formal education and other settings, and experience of the go_girl learning environment. We use illustrative quotes from participants rather than summaries of narratives. Bresler (1996, p.136) notes that the researcher has power to shape representations of participants in publications. Considering issues of power dynamics and representation, direct quotes were important to use in order to represent the unique perspectives and voices of the participants, helping to deepen understanding for readers (Corben & Sainsbury, 2006, p. 13). Pseudonyms have been used to protect their identities.

Interviews during the program were carried out in a private office at the University of Oxford Department of Education. To provide transparency and increase trustworthiness (Arriaza et al., 2015, p. 85), we have provided information, including relevant interests of the researchers (following Twining et al., 2017, p. A6) for this program. The data was collected by two female University researchers, one a developmental psychologist and the other a doctoral researcher, both interested in issues of digital inequalities. They were also instructors on the program. Follow-up interviews were conducted in a private office by a female postdoctoral researcher and educator interested in education reform and digital inequalities. She was not an instructor on the program. Data analysis was carried out by the second and third researchers discussed here alongside an additional female postdoctoral researcher with experience working in education and social care focused on young people who experience disadvantage. Conscious of our positionalities as academics, we understood the importance of connecting with participants with the help of our youth worker and creating opportunities (e.g. weekly check-ins, conversations and outings) to develop our relationships and build trust with our participants in order to better understand their experiences. Researchers were motivated by an understanding of digital inequalities, particularly among young women who experience high levels of disadvantage and the main goal was to understand the impact of the go_girl program on the lives of participants.

4.2. Analytical approach
Examining self-concept involves developing an understanding of people's schemas and attitudes toward themselves and how this influences their outlook on their life (Bandura, 1997). We used qualitative content analysis for the interview data and followed Carney’s (1990) ladder of analytic abstraction, which entails three steps. The first step involves summarizing and coding the data. We made conscious steps to keep track of the data collection and analysis process. We made notes on printed transcripts, used NVivo to develop descriptive codes, and created summaries that were each discussed internally between the researchers.

The second step involves identifying themes in the data. We devised new thematic codes at this stage. In order to secure dependability in our research, the identification of themes and the associated codes were agreed upon by the research team after independent reviews of the data. All emergent themes were discussed and verified throughout the analysis in order to ensure consistent and accurate interpretation. Prominent themes emerging inductively from our data included self-confidence, education/career aspirations, academic performance and views of self in relation to technology. Instances in which participants discussed their academic abilities, or abilities to complete projects or obtain jobs, were coded under self-confidence. An aspirations code was used for passages about goals for the future and an academic performance code was used for passages about performance in school and informal learning contexts. Additionally, we coded for changes in self-concept in relation to computing, applying this code when a participant reported that they viewed themselves differently in relation to technology or when their narratives made it clear that there had been such a change.

We employed a reflexive iterative approach to our analysis, a continuous “revisiting of the data” in order to connect them with “emerging insights, progressively leading to refined focus and understanding” (Srivastava, 2009, p. 77). For example, reviewing text segments given the general descriptive code of “challenges” in early analysis of the data led to the discovery that lack of self-confidence was a salient challenge for many of the participants, which began pointing us towards the importance of self-concept. Similarly, in reviewing text segments grouped under the code “views of tech,” we learned that several go_girls described themselves increasingly as creators rather than simply users of tech, which also brought us to focus more on self-concept as a unifying analytical concept in the study. These examples demonstrate how the analytical process progressed from description and summary to interpretation “where researchers attempt to theorize the significance of the patterns and their broader meanings and interpretations” (Nowell et al., 2017, p. 11). Self-concept thus represents the final step in Carney's ladder of abstraction, synthesizing and developing an explanatory framework. Three researchers were involved in coding and interpreting the data to provide triangulation, and each concurred on the conclusions.

The following section presents the themes that emerged from the narratives of the nine participants of the 2015/16 cohort. Two participants, Natalie and Allison, did not complete the program due to bereavement and health concerns. However, their narratives are included because they demonstrate the challenges experienced by the young women and, in the case of Natalie, a change in self-concept as a result of her participation.

5. Findings
5.1. Participants’ life experiences that negatively impacted their self-concepts
The baseline interviews revealed important information about participants' life challenges and views of themselves and their capabilities. For example, Claire and Susan were very discouraged by their inability to find suitable employment and Natalie seemed a bit lost, stating, “I've been thinking about going back to college and stuff and maybe doing more computer work, but I just – at the moment – I really don't know what I need to do.”

Allison struggled in college, became overwhelmed and stopped attending. She explained that the workload was, “too overwhelming, I like to take things … at my own pace, otherwise I get rushed and I won't be able to complete a piece of work properly.” A short time later, she was accepted onto a different education program. However, she then faced financial difficulties, which hindered her ability to attend school. Even though these financial problems were beyond her control, she still felt that she had “failed.” She expressed a desire to explore Mathematics and Physics but said, “I don't think I've really had the courage … because I am worried that I will fail and I don't want to fail because this is, like I said, my two favorite subjects.”

Jemma had doubts about attending university, stating, “I don't think I am clever at all! Because if I was, I would be able to go to uni now.” Pamela was extremely worried about academic failure, as she had experienced this in the past. She explained, “I might fail exams, like my Maths again and my ICT. [I'm] worried that I would fail.” Also, for Pamela, being bullied in school contributed to her lack of confidence and fear of failure. She described some of these traumatic experiences:

Everyone laughed at me for being … Walk weird, talk weird, all that. And then one time at music they [other students] were talking about my walking and everything and that completely embarrassed me in front of the teacher. I just felt like I wanted to walk out of the classroom and then just cry my eyes out … I got hit by a girl once and then the others they were like … They swear at me. They physically kicked me in the back of the leg.

Erica also experienced bullying by boys at school as well as school failure. She was kicked out of school and recalls how, “everyone told me I'd never do well, I wouldn't go anywhere in life.”

As illustrated by these narratives, the life experiences of these young women, some having additional complicating factors including mental health issues and troubled family situations, left them feeling discouraged, with a lack of confidence and fear of failure. This negatively impacted their ability to aspire and stifled their perceived trajectories for the future. This is not uncommon in young people with early and continuing experiences of disadvantage. The complicating circumstances experienced by this group of young women illuminate factors that can negatively impact self-concepts and hinder the pursuit of education and employment.

5.2. Program influence on changes to participants’ academic self-concepts
Many of the young women appreciated how the program was designed, viewing their go_girl learning experiences as different from school experiences. Margaret felt that the go_girl experience was “more grown-upish” and that there was “less uniformity” than at school. Pamela felt that go_girl went “beyond the basics” she learned in school IT classes. For example, she never learned how to create games at school. Patricia described IT in school as quite “basic” and Erica described school IT activities as “childish” and “boring.” In a discussion about learning Scratch in school, Claire described her experience as “vague” and not “in depth.”

Participants also reported differences in their frame of mind when working within the go_girl program. Erica and Pamela reported feeling “relaxed” and “less stressed,” as the program was not focused on passing a course. They found it helpful to work at their own pace, knowing that assistance was readily available. This was particularly important for Claire and Natalie. Claire was very shy and reluctant to ask questions in school. Natalie faced particular difficulties in her ICT courses in school. She explained,

With school you kind of just had to struggle along on your own … I was in a special needs school so there [were] more complex needs than [mine] and all the attention [was] on them and I felt just alone to get on with what I needed to get on with. And if I struggled I just refused to do it, you know? But here, if I'm struggling I can ask for help and you will give it as much as you can.

Natalie also felt that the hands-on approach to instruction was helpful. She “liked the bits where you can actually actively do something, rather than just watching and listening to people, showing you how to do something.” She enjoyed learning “Scratch and trying to work out [create] the games.” Many also appreciated being able to choose a topic for their projects, based on their interests. Pamela and Claire described the creation of projects as a positive challenge.

Erica also felt that the hands-on approach to instruction was helpful. She explained:

I saw a different way of education … I didn't really do well in school, I hated school, and being here, just learning in a different way, not like listening to a teacher … you were learning while doing it. Like me and Susan [created] the website.

She credits this “different way” of education with making her “study more,” even in areas beyond computing. This outcome is significant for Erica, as failing school had greatly diminished her confidence about pursuing future goals.

Developing better computing skills, working as a team and learning in a relaxed environment were helpful aspects of the program for Susan. She stated,

I wasn't really good with computers … I found it really hard to concentrate. And doing these go_girl sessions helped me a lot to just relax and just get on with it, and to be able to work as part of a team, because I used to be quite independent. I liked just to keep my head down and just get on with my own work, but when it came to go-girl, we all got together and it was better because it was easier for a lot of us because … we all have different skills when it comes to stuff like that, and if you put them together, then it makes a good team.

Susan emphasizes the importance of the team here, which functioned as a support network for her. She also learned something new about herself, explaining, “I didn't know how creative my mind was until I joined go_girl. We created games, we showed important people [community audience] and they took the time to listen to us, and it was really good.”

Lastly, Pamela spoke about the encouragement from go_girl staff members as the most helpful aspect of the program. She explained that, “everyone stood behind me … and believed me that I could do something that was going to be worthwhile.” Her statements indicate that the program served as a support network, providing learning opportunities as well as much needed encouragement and a boost to her self-esteem.

These narratives illustrate the various ways in which participants found the program design helpful for their learning experience. As mentioned above, the hands-on approach to learning, interesting and in-depth sessions, readily available support, guidance, and encouragement were beneficial, helping participants feel more relaxed and supported.

5.3. Changes in participants’ self-concepts related to education and career aspirations
Aspirations refer to goals for one's possible future self. Six participants indicated that the go_girl program had an influence on their education or career aspirations. One developed higher aspirations, three achieved more clarity regarding their goals, and two developed a broader view of what is possible for them to achieve in life. Some participants realized that they could aspire to do more than take any job simply to earn money. This was the case with Susan and Claire and it indicates a change in their self-confidence and perception of their abilities. Additionally, sharing these aspirations with staff members was an important step toward receiving guidance on further exploration and on how to transform aspirations into capabilities.

Pamela, in her baseline interview, said she wanted to secure a job or apprenticeship but was still thinking about her future. She was passionate about gaming and knew she wanted to learn how to create 2D and 3D games. Her desire to create games remained constant throughout the first two interviews. However, in the third interview, she expressed a desire to continue on to higher education, take her GCSEs and attend university for a degree in IT or CS. Alternatively, she would pursue office work until finding the right university. She credits go_girl for helping her clarify her goals:

I had no idea what I wanted to do for my future … until go_girl came along. Now I've realized my potential was in gaming.

Initially, Susan planned to work in retail to start earning money and then “build up to something better.” During her second interview, she expressed a desire to become a personal trainer. She had already taken “BTEC1 sport, PE, practical and theory” courses for two years, so it was apparent that she enjoyed working in this field. This was certainly a shift from her first interview, in which the focus was solely on obtaining a job to earn money instead of pursuing a career that she would enjoy.

Claire felt that the program broadened her view of career options. She explained,

If I didn't go to go_girl, I'd just get a normal job in retail somewhere or just another normal office job. But going to go_girl, it made me think about apprenticeships and actually getting more qualifications … what would benefit me more than just getting money in.

Natalie, in her baseline interview, said that she wanted a better-paying job with an employer supportive of her, given her learning disabilities. She saw working in a shop or with animals as possibilities. However, she also talked about how she used to help others in school ICT classes and believes that this increased her own understanding. This idea of helping others to use technology was further developed in her second interview, in which she talked about possibly teaching adults and teenagers about gaming. In her third interview, she said she had been thinking about going back to college and possibly doing more computer work. Her ideas about future employment had broadened.

Jemma's thinking about her career progressed during the program and, in the second interview, she was considering becoming a sociology teacher. By the third interview, she had been accepted onto an Access course2 for teaching. She plans to go to university to study teaching and sport and become a primary school teacher. While participating in go_girl, her career goal became more focused in terms of what kind of teacher she wanted to become. She reported that participating in the program had raised her confidence level and that she had more confidence to embark on her education journey.

Patricia, in her baseline interview, said she wanted to go to university and possibly teach social science. In the second interview, she was thinking about a career focusing on sport and food or possibly becoming a primary school teacher or architect. In her final interview, she reported that she applied for and completed the assessment for an Access course. Her plan after the course was to enroll in university for a Joint Honours in Sport and Education. Like Jemma, Patricia's goals became more specific during her time as a participant.

5.4. Changes in participant's self-concepts in computing
We found that many participants experienced notable changes in how they viewed themselves in relation to computing. Natalie felt that the program helped her realize her interest in computers and she expressed a desire to “re-enact,” alter or remix videogames to combine characters from existing games and create her own unique game.

Susan learned that there is a lot more to “computering” than people think. “People just think, oh, I'm making a PowerPoint presentation and everything, but we actually made the games … I didn't know that you can actually do things like that.” This statement indicates a broadened understanding of possibilities and a change in self-concept related to technology. Through the process of creating a game, her knowledge of self began to change. She now understands it is possible for her to be a maker and not just a consumer of technology. Susan also suggested that the go_girl program be expanded: “we should be doing a pass/merit/distinction sort of thing … and then … we get certificates out of it when we've done it and it made us feel like we'd definitely achieved something.” This indicates her desire to learn more about coding as well as her enjoyment of feeling she has achieved something worthwhile.

Erica, who initially did not think she would be interested in coding, explained that,

before we first started [go_girl], coding had no interest to me. But once you start doing it … you see yourself achieving something, like how we achieved to make a website, then it actually makes you think you can actually achieve something in life, if you put your mind to it.

Erica also felt that the program helped her to see “things from a different perspective,” with greater appreciation for how apps were made, “what is behind it, the coding.” These statements by Erica and Susan indicate that they developed a more encompassing behind-the-scenes view of technology beyond just being a user. Erica developed a curiosity and a better understanding of how things are made with code. Additionally, she suggested that it would have been good to have additional opportunities to code beyond what was required for one project, as she wanted to try “different things.” Again, we see here that a desire to learn more about coding has developed.

Claire was already somewhat interested in computing before she started go_girl. However, she stated that she “wasn't really into it. But this [go_girl] has just pulled me into it more.” Her former views about getting a “normal job” in retail or in an office may have been influenced by stereotypical gender roles and views of what is “normal” for women in the workforce:

I've learned computer skills, coding and all of that … It helped me a lot. Like, when I tell people about it, they're quite fascinated about it because you never normally expect this interest to come from girls.

Echoing other girls’ experiences of creating with technology, Jemma, in her baseline interview, talked about using the Internet to find sugar-free recipes. This interest developed into a creative endeavor to design a fitness app with a weekly diet and workout plan. She explained that going through the process of planning and creating the app “helped me see different views of healthiness.” In addition to learning technical skills, her knowledge about how to maintain a healthy lifestyle was enhanced.

Erica enjoyed creating a website and felt that this skill was important for her future because “if I made a business or something, then you could make your own website and it's more helpful, more of a skill in future life.” She also talked about the enjoyment of learning about technology at a deeper level:

Instead of just like straightforward, like social media statuses, uploading things, messaging people, it's all open … A year ago I only saw social media and like things that teenagers would use but now I know how to – like there are so many different things around it, like coding, so different and you just see technology in a different way.

Claire created a game that would appeal to children for her project. A statement she made about this experience indicates a change in her perception of her capabilities with technology:

Whenever I'm playing Pokémon Go I'll say to someone, ‘Oh, look, I know the software that they made Pokémon Go with’. I know how to use the software so I can make the game as well, so it was a quite proud moment.

The go_girl program sparked an initial interest in coding for many of the young women and also a desire to learn more about coding. They developed a broader understanding of technology, beyond social media use, and a view of themselves as women who can use technology to produce useful and creative projects.

6. Discussion
This qualitative study sought to examine changes in the self-concepts of participants of the go_girl code + create program. Our analytical approach explored participant narratives that shed light on how social contexts, including formal education, negatively impacted self-concepts. These narratives illustrate the ways in which circumstances have limited participants’ capacity to aspire in terms of their education and career trajectories and how they view themselves in relation to computing. We set out to answer two research questions: What changes were identified in participant narratives related to their self-concepts? Which aspects of the program likely contributed to these changes? We found that participant descriptions of changes in self-concepts divided into self-concept related to educational and career aspirations and those related to computing.

6.1. Changes in self-concept related to education and career aspirations
All participants indicated that the go_girl program had an influence on their self-concept related to education and career aspirations. One participant had higher aspirations, three achieved more clarity regarding their goals, and two developed a broader view of what is possible for them to achieve in life. This is significant given the personal challenges of participants discussed in section 5.1, particularly their difficulties in formal education settings (e.g. feelings of being overwhelmed or expectations of failure). Indeed, a number of studies have shown that negative experiences in school for working class young people lessen the likelihood that they will go on to higher education (Bowman et al., 2000; Horgan, 2007; Reay, 2002). In addition, low educational attainment, low expectations from teachers or family and a lack of positive input from adults or peers may all contribute to low self-esteem in NEET young people. Studies indicate that educational failure or bullying at an early age greatly affects confidence and self-esteem (Evans et al., 2009; Ross, 2009). A positive change in academic self-concepts can influence education and career aspirations.

A primary goal of go_girl is to help participants develop the capacity to aspire and the program appears to have contributed to changes in educational and career aspirations. If we adopt Rosenberg’s (1979, p.7) view of self-concept as “the totality of an individual's thoughts and feelings having reference to himself as an object,” then this encompasses young women's views of their aspirations or “possible selves” (Markus & Nurius, 1986). Harrison (2018, p.7) writes that possible selves are “constructed within a sociocultural context that shapes which selves appear possible, desirable or probable, as well as through the personal experiences that challenge or reinforce our palette of possible selves.” The importance of sociocultural context is emphasized by Appadurai (2004, p.67), who suggests aspirations fall within the domain of culture and are intertwined with cultural norms. Additionally, Bourdieu sheds light on another aspect of social context that influences aspirations: “Agents shape their aspirations according to concrete indices of the accessible and the inaccessible, of what is and is not ‘for us’” (Bourdieu, 1990, p. 40). In other words, aspirations are shaped by what a person perceives as likely or possible and sometimes help is needed to realize an expanded range of possibilities. This expanded range of possibilities was illustrated when go_girl participants Susan and Claire's views about work were broadened and they began to think about obtaining additional qualifications and working toward a career.

6.2. Aspects of the program that likely contributed to changes in self-concept related to education and career aspirations
Learning to code and utilize digital tools to create meaningful projects was integral to the process of developing the capacity to aspire, as it cultivated a sense of mastery and accomplishment within the young women. Research suggests that an enhanced realistic sense of mastery increases students’ expectations and attempts to achieve these expectations, which in turn may enhance a sense of mastery (Prince-Embury et al., 2016, p. 36).

Hence, the process of coding and creating in go_girl can be understood as more than simply skills development. It also served as a conduit for raising or clarifying aspirations and strengthening academic self-concept. In addition, in line with Karpman (1968), it helped shift the young women's perspectives from being victims of their career and educational histories, to being creators of their career paths and aspirations.

6.3. Changes in self-concept related to computing
In addition to changes in self-concept related to education and career aspirations, five of the participants indicated changes in self-concept related to computing. More specifically, they began to view themselves as makers and not just consumers of technology. This is a particularly salient finding for this demographic of young women as they are from lower-income households with complicated circumstances. As such, they face considerable barriers to developing sophisticated digital skills. Prior to the program, many of them lacked the knowledge that technology could be utilized for more than communicating on social media sites and composing documents with computer applications software. This lack of knowledge and the accompanying lack of skills are all obstacles under the umbrella of problematic technology access (Eynon, 2009; Van Dijk & Hacker, 2003), which negatively impacts the ability to use digital tools for participation in wider society. In addition, there is great disparity between views of digital interests between middle-class and lower-income groups (Livingstone & Sefton-Green, 2016; North et al., 2008; Rideout & Katz, 2016). Rafalow (2018) has noted how wealthy students’ digital interests and skills are more likely to be celebrated and translated into teacher-supported opportunities for achievement compared to their working class or minority counterparts. This highlights the significance of environmental factors that shape views of what computing is and thus influences views of self in relation to computing.

6.4. Aspects of the program that likely contributed to changes in self-concept related to computing
One of the goals of the go_girl program is to help the young women become full participants in society. The development of more advanced computing knowledge and skills; the process of doing and making their websites, games and apps; and sharing what they created during a presentation in front of family, friends and academics, allowed for more social participation which enhanced self-confidence and bolstered self-concept related to computing.

Certainly, doing and making have long played significant roles in education, going back to Dewey (1906) who advocated for more learning by doing, working collaboratively with others, and making connections with the world outside the classroom. Additionally, Papert's theory of constructionism is a related idea, described by Martinez and Stager (2013, p.21) as “learning by constructing knowledge through the act of making something shareable.” These ideas have recently been adopted and extended by maker movement researchers to become what is recognised as “critical making” (Ratto, 2011), which focuses on the process of making (rather than on the resultant objects), taking into account the relationship between technologies and society and the ways in which this relationship may cultivate emancipatory changes in one's life (Hughes, 2017, p. 105). More recently, researchers have also written about the influence of science and technology studies (STS) on the maker movement (Lachney & Foster, 2020). Several of our participants mentioned their satisfaction with learning by doing and a salient outcome related to self-concept was seeing themselves as having the ability to use technology to create. This realization can be viewed as emancipatory. Examples include Susan's realisation that she is creative and Claire's broadened view of her possible career options.

Participant narratives indicate that additional factors contributed to changes in self-concepts related to computing. The small group learning space allowed for more personalized instruction and time for staff members to develop relationships with the young women so that they felt comfortable asking questions and receiving assistance. Having a choice of project topic and platform was also an important factor, allowing participants to fulfil the requirements of the program while pursuing personal interests.

6.5. Additional aspects of the program that likely contributed to changes in self-concepts
Finally, we suggest that the young women felt a sense of belongingness in the go_girl program. Belongingness refers to a perception of being accepted, respected and included (Goodenow, 1993) and also understood by others (Riley & White, 2016). Many of them described feelings of marginalization in school due to problems associated with peer relationships and academic failure. Certainly, these issues can decrease or negate feelings of belongingness and contribute to disengagement in school and society. However, in the go_girl setting they described feeling more relaxed and less stressed. Also, all of the go_girl staff members, with the exception of one person, were female. This provided role models to counteract the stereotypical male geek image that has so often been associated with computing expertise and widely discussed by academics (Berg et al., 2018; Margolis & Fisher, 2002; Michell et al., 2017). Additionally, the young women inhabited, and were accepted into, the university space. They interacted with academics and professionals from a variety of sectors and presented their finished projects. All these factors contributed to a sense of belongingness. We argue that these factors were important for their achievements in the program and for fostering changes in their self-concepts.

The go_girl program design is transferable and could be implemented in other settings and tailored to meet the needs of different groups. We are cautious about making definitive claims of generalizability regarding our findings, as they are specific to the lived experiences of our participants. However, the changes in self-concepts experienced by each of our participants and the many research studies we have cited demonstrating a reciprocal relationship between academic self-concept and academic achievement suggest that our program would be beneficial to a wider population of young people.

7. Conclusion
The narratives of participants in the go_girl program revealed a variety of influences that negatively impacted their academic self-concept and hindered their full participation in society. The go_girl program sought to counteract these influences and empower these young women by helping them clarify or broaden their aspirations and develop their capabilities in the use of digital tools, media production and coding. It was hoped that achievement in these areas would provide a pathway for re-entry into formal education, employment or training. Participant narratives illuminated the potential for informal learning spaces to function in this capacity and 100% of the participants from the 2015/16 cohort who completed the program have transitioned from NEET to EET. A holistic multidisciplinary approach, tailored to the individual characteristics of each participant and set within an informal learning space, can be particularly well-suited to help marginalized young women enhance their academic self-concepts and develop a basic level of interest and skills in coding and creating with digital tools. The development of partnerships is vital in addressing the educational and social needs of participants.

A limitation of this study is that the data were gathered from the first go_girl cohort, which necessarily had a small number of participants. The program was designed to serve small cohorts of young women (7–8) in each weekly session to provide the necessary support for each participant. Studies of future cohorts with participants in diverse communities are needed to determine if similar outcomes can be established. In future studies of the program, it will be useful to capture longer-term participant experiences (Miller, 2015), particularly social mobility and education/career trajectories. It was difficult to maintain communication with many of the participants after the program ended, partly due to their busy school and work schedules. While this is a rewarding outcome, systems could be established to maximize the possibility for future engagement.

This study demonstrates the potential of qualitative research to add an important dimension to the study of self-concept. The findings indicate that academic self-concept, technological empowerment and social empowerment are intertwined in such a way that learning-by-doing with digital technologies, in an individually tailored and supportive environment, can enhance a sense of mastery and the capacity to aspire. Certainly there has been an increased emphasis on the importance of learning to code as a remedy for the UK's “digital skills crisis” and many countries around the world are touting the transformative abilities of coding and ICT-driven education initiatives. As we have argued in the introduction, overtly economic motivations for computing interventions are often quite narrow and deterministic, and do not address the existing structural inequalities and the conditions that hinder progression for marginalized women with complex circumstances. However, learning to code and utilise digital tools can provide additional benefits beyond simply improving digital skills solely to bolster national competitiveness. As our study indicates, programs that combine social, emotional, psychological and technical skills development with a focus on enhancing aspects of participant's self-concept, provide an example of how we might increase digital and social inclusion for marginalized young women so that they may become full participants in the digital society.
