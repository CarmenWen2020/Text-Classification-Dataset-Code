Social networking sites (SNS) addiction has become a social problem among young adolescents in many areas of the world. The current study examined the role of socioeconomic status (SES) in children and adolescents' SNS addiction, taking into account parents' attitudes and behavior with regard to information communication technology (ICT). Participants were 823 students (ages 9–15; 49.94 % girls) who completed questionnaires in their classrooms. The results showed that: (1) SES was negatively associated with SNS addiction; (2) active parental mediation mediated this association; and (3) parents' ICT attitude moderated this mediating effect; specifically, the association between SES and active parental mediation was weaker for parents with more positive attitudes toward ICT. These findings provide guidance for prevention and intervention related to children and adolescents’ SNS addiction.

1. Introduction
In the current information age, more and more people use social networking sites (SNS) for communication and entertainment. There are an estimated 4.20 billion social media users around the world, equivalent to 53.6 percent of the world's total population (We are Social, 2021). In the United States, 70 % of adolescents use social media (e.g., Facebook) at least once a day (Common Sense Media, 2018). Similarly, a report by the China Internet Network Information Center (CINIC; 2020) indicated that the penetration rates of WeChat Moments and Qzone, the most popular SNSs in China, were 85.1 % and 47.6 %, respectively. At the same time, there are 175 million young people aged 6–18 who are active users in China (CINIC, 2020).

Though SNSs provide various conveniences and benefits (Meng et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2014), the use of SNSs may also bring negative effects such as procrastination (Meier et al., 2016), depression (Appel et al., 2015), and SNS addiction (Błachnio et al., 2016). SNS addiction refers to excessive use of SNSs, inability to control involvement with SNS, and accompanied by the maladaptive outcomes (Liu & Ma, 2019). It has been shown to be closely associated with depression (Wang et al., 2018), fear of missing out (Yin et al., 2019), irrational procrastination (Lian et al., 2018) and poor academic performance (Tsitsika et al., 2014). Other studies have focused on predictors of SNS. Personality factors (Chen & Roberts, 2019), attachment anxiety (Liu & Ma, 2019), and emotional cognition (Vaghefi et al., 2020) were all significant predictors.

There has been relatively less research on family factors in relation to children and adolescents' SNS addiction. Family factors are of great importance for individuals’ development and adaptation (Bradley & Corwyn, 2002; Brent, 1995; Heckman, 2008; Yen et al., 2007). In addition, children and adolescents are particularly active in various online activities, and thus more vulnerable to SNS addiction (Hong et al., 2014; Müller et al., 2016). Against this background, more research attention should be paid to identifying factors within the family system that influence youth SNS use and addiction. This information can be translated into prevention and intervention programs to reduce the risk of SNS addiction.

2. Literature review and hypotheses
2.1. Socioeconomic status and youth SNS addiction
Ecological systems theory maintains that individuals live in multiple nested environmental systems in which the interactions between the individual and the environment shape development and adaptation (Bronfenbrenner, 1979, 1986). One of the immediate and influential environments in family function is socioeconomic status. Family socioeconomic status (SES) is a multifaceted construct that is usually represented by factors related to income, education and occupation (Li et al., 2011; McLoyd, 1998). SES is closely associated with children's brain development (Hackman & Farah, 2009; Noble et al. 2006, 2015; Raizada et al., 2008), psychosocial development (Duncan et al., 2015; Hoff et al., 2002; Letourneau et al., 2013), and academic achievement (Sirin, 2016). For example, parental education and income are related to the size of children's brain surface in areas related to the development of language, executive function, and memory (Noble et al., 2015). At the same time, families with low SES usually have low income and low parental education, and children from low-SES families are at higher risk for developmental problems (Bradley & Corwyn, 2002), such as internalizing behavior problems (e.g., depression and anxiety) and externalizing behavior problems (e.g., aggression and substance use; Hiscock et al., 2012; Letourneau et al., 2013; Petruzelka et al., 2020).

In the current information era, low SES is also an important risk factor for internet-related problem behaviors (Faltýnková et al., 2020; Islam & Hossin, 2016; Urbanova et al., 2019). For instance, a study of 10,719 participants aged 11–15 years indicated that youth with lower SES had a higher probability of internet addiction (Faltýnková et al., 2020). SNS addiction is a specific form of internet addiction (Kuss & Griffiths, 2011; Müller et al., 2016), and its influencing factors may be similar to those of internet addiction (Ndasauka et al., 2016). Thus, this study aimed to examine the association between SES and SNS addiction among youth in middle childhood and adolescence.

2.2. Family factors and youth SNS addiction
Ecological systems theory points to the family as the most immediate environment in which the child develops and adapts (Bronfenbrenner, 1979, 1986). In the current study, we focused on two aspects of the family environment in relation to youth's SNS addiction: parents' active mediation, and parents' attitudes toward information communication technology (ICT).

2.2.1. The mediating role of active parental mediation
Active parental mediation is recognized as an essential influence in reducing adolescent risk behaviors (Li et al., 2000a, 2000b). Active mediation often occurs in the context of discussions in which parents can offer guidance and advice (Chen & Chng, 2016; Padilla-Walker & Coyne, 2011; Rodriguez-De-Dios et al., 2018). Discussions on internet use have been shown to be related to higher digital skills (Rodriguez-De-Dios et al., 2018) and internet literacy (Vijayalakshmi et al., 2020). So, it could improve children's critical thinking skills (Nathanson, 1999), skepticism (Vijayalakshmi et al., 2020), autonomy (Steinfeld, 2021) and self-regulation competencies (Chen & Chng, 2016). This type of discussion can also minimize the risk of problematical internet use (Chen & Shi, 2018; Livingstone et al., 2017; Steinfeld, 2021). In addition, active parental mediation has been shown to significantly mitigate problematic internet-related behaviors among adolescents, such as mobile phone dependency and excessive internet use (Kalmus, Blinka, & Ólafsson, 2015; Nielsen et al., 2019; Xin et al., 2020). Therefore, active parental mediation may decrease the risk of SNS addiction.

In addition, parental mediation of children's internet use may also be affected by family socioeconomic status. According to the family investment model (Duncan et al., 2015) high SES parents have more financial resources and free time to invest in their children than low SES parents do. Consistent with this model, parents with high SES tend to spend more time with their children and give them more guidance and instructions than parents with low SES (Hoff et al., 2002; Li et al., 2020). Similarly, parents with low SES show less frequent parent-child communication and less parental mediation (Durkee et al., 2012; Zhao & Phillips, 2013). That may be because of the accessibility and availability of computer at home. High SES family have more access to computers and internet at home (Becker, 2000), while low SES family are less likely to access these facilities (Evans & Kantrowitz, 2002).

2.3. The moderating role of parents’ ICT attitude
It should be acknowledged that the influence of SES on parental rearing behaviors might be affected by other factors (e.g., parental attitudes and beliefs; Hoff et al., 2002; Ribas et al., 2003; Warren, 2005). Parental attitudes and beliefs are closely associated with parenting behaviors. For example, parents' attitude toward watching TV has been shown to be significantly associated with their mediation in children's TV viewing, such as setting rules for what, when, and how long to watch (Warren, 2005). Similarly, parents' attitude toward information communication technology (ICT) may influence their mediation in computer use. Parents' ICT attitude is defined as parents' belief about the general importance and usefulness of ICT for their children (Aesaert et al., 2015). Several studies have shown that a person's attitude toward ICT is associated with their ICT-related behavior (Bordalba & Bochaca, 2019; Edmunds et al., 2012; Siragusa & Dixon, 2009). For example, Bordalba and Bochaca (2019) found that parents and teachers displaying a more positive stance on ICT were more likely to use ICT for family-school communication. Another study found that parents who believe that children learn a lot from educational apps are more likely to use this type of technology with their children (Tahir & Arif, 2015).

It is possible that the association between SES and parent mediation is moderated by parents' ICT attitude. Low SES is generally associated with lower mediation in children's ICT behavior (Li et al., 2020), this association may be attenuated among low-SES parents who have a positive ICT attitude. Because these parents believe that ICT is beneficial for children, they may be more involved than other low SES parents in using ICT to create learning opportunities, provide technical assistance, and regulate children's use of the internet. Similarly, although parents with high SES tend to engage in more parental mediation related to ICT, this association may be attenuated among high-SES parents who have a negative attitude toward ICT. These parents may have less frequent or less helpful discussions with their children and in other ways may be less engaged in children's use of ICT.

2.4. The present study
Fig. 1 presents the proposed moderated mediation model in which socioeconomic status is negatively associated with SNS addiction; this association is mediated by active parental mediation; and parents' ICT attitude moderates the first link in the mediated pathway (the association between SES and parent mediation). This model was tested in a large sample of youth aged 9 to 15, a period covering the transition from middle childhood to adolescence.

Fig. 1. The proposed moderated mediation model.

Previous studies found that age and gender were related to parental mediation and to SNS addiction. Specifically, active parental mediation is negatively correlated with child age, as autonomy needs increase with children growing into adolescence (Chng et al., 2014; Padilla-Walker et al., 2012). Likewise, children's opportunities to access the internet increase with age, and adolescents are more likely than younger children to show SNS addiction (Kalmus, Blinka, & Ólafsson, 2015). With regard to gender, girls are more likely than boys to use the SNS as a tool for communicating with others (Kim et al., 2010; Marino et al., 2018), and parents of girls tend to be more concerned about the dangers posed by the internet bad information (Sonck et al., 2013). In this background, girls have been shown to be at higher risk of internet addiction (Marino et al., 2018; Pilar et al., 2019) and receive more parental mediation compared to boys (Chng et al., 2014; Sonck et al., 2013). Therefore, we controlled age and gender in tests of the hypotheses.

The research hypotheses were as follows:

Hypothesis 1

Socioeconomic status is negatively associated with SNS addiction among youth in middle childhood and adolescence.

Hypothesis 2a

SES is positively associated with active parental mediation;

Hypothesis 2b

Active parental mediation is negatively associated with SNS addiction;

Hypothesis 2c

: Active parental mediation mediates the relationship between SES and SNS addiction.

Hypothesis 3a

Active parental mediation is positively associated with parents' ICT attitude;

Hypothesis 3b

Parents' ICT attitude moderates the relationship between SES and active parental mediation.

3. Methodology
3.1. Participants
The participants were recruited by convenience sampling in two primary schools and two junior high schools in Xiangyang, a city in central China. A total of 830 questionnaires were collected, 823 of which were valid. They were 452 primary school students (217 girls; fifth and sixth grades) and 371 junior high school students (194 girls, seventh and eighth grades). The age of participants ranged from 9 to 15, with the average age of 12.41 ± 1.23 years old.

3.2. Instrumentation
3.2.1. Socioeconomic status
The Family Affluence Scale was adopted to assess family socioeconomic status (SES; Currie et al., 2008). This measure has been used in many countries as a measure of SES (Koivusilta et al., 2006; Park et al., 2012; Rouchun et al., 2019), including in research by the World Health Organization to measure of national wealth in 35 countries (Boyce et al., 2006). It consists of four items: Does your family own a car, van, or truck (No = 0; Yes, one = 1; Yes, two or more = 0); During the past 12 months, how many times did you travel away on holiday with your family (Not at all = 1; Once = 2; More than twice = 1); How many computers does your family own (None = 0; One = 1; Two = 2; More than two = 3); and do you have your bedroom for yourself (No = 0; Yes = 1). Scores on these items were summed to create a total score, with higher scores reflecting higher SES. Due to the small number of items and the irregular scoring system, Cronbach's alpha would be expected to be relatively low. Indeed, other research in Chinese children and adolescent samples has shown alpha values of 0.58 (Liu et al., 2012) and 0.56 (Chen et al., 2016). Therefore, the Cronbach's alpha in the present study was 0.50 is comparable to that of previous studies and is considered a helpful measure of SES.

3.2.2. Social networking sites addiction scale
The revised version of the Facebook Addiction Scale (FAS) (Koc & Gulyagci, 2013) was used to assess social networking site addiction. A representative item is: “I feel anxious if I cannot access social networking sites (i.e., Qzone, WeChat Moments and Weibo).” The scale consists of eight items, each rated using a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (not true) to 5 (extremely true), with higher scores indicating a higher degree of addiction. A Chinese language version was found to have satisfactory reliability (α = 0.86) and validity (Lian et al., 2018). In the current study, the reliability score of the scale was α = 0.89.

3.2.3. Active parental mediation
The Parental Mediation Through Guidance scale was used to assess parents' active parental mediation (Sasson & Mesch, 2014). A representative item is: “Your parents would help you when something is difficult to do or find on the internet.” The scale consists of six items, with “yes” responses coded as 1 and “no” as 0. Item scores are summed, with higher scores indicating higher parental help provided to children in using the internet. In the present study, the measure was translated to Chinese and found to have good validity and reliability. Confirmatory Factor Analysis showed a good fit index: χ2/df = 4.613, RMSEA = 0.066, CFI = 0.989, TLI = 0.976. Sasson and Mesch (2014) determined that Cronbach's alpha for the English language version was strong (α = 0.84). The reliability of the Chinese language version used in this study was comparable (α = 0.88).

3.2.4. Parents’ attitude toward information and communication technology (ICT)
The Parents' ICT Attitude Scale (Aesaert et al., 2015) was used to assess parents' positive attitudes toward ICT. A representative item is: “My parents think if I learn to work with a computer I will be more successful in the future.” The scale consists of five items, each rated using a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree), with higher scores reflecting more positive beliefs about ICT and higher perceived usefulness of ICT for their children. In the present study, the measure was translated into Chinese and found to have good validity and reliability. Confirmatory Factor Analysis showed a good fit index: χ2/df = 2.266, RMSEA = 0.039, CFI = 0.999, TLI = 0.996. Aesaert et al. (2015) determined that Cronbach's alpha for the scale was strong (α = 0.85). In the current study, the reliability was comparable (α = 0.91).

3.3. Data collection and analysis
3.3.1. Data collection
The approval to conduct the study was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee of the authors' university and from the principals of the participating schools. Parents provided informed written consent and the children and adolescents provided assent. Data collection was overseen by well-trained graduate students majoring in psychology. During regular class hours, the youth completed paper-and-pencil questionnaires on demographics (gender, age, and SES), active parental mediation, SNS addiction, and parents’ ICT attitude. Participation took 10–20 min. Students were compensated with a small gift upon finishing the questionnaires.

3.3.2. Data analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS 23.0. To begin, mean imputation was used to estimate missing values (<2 % missing data per person). Next, descriptive statistics were employed to calculate means, standard deviations, and Pearson correlations among the study variables (H1, H2a, H2b, H3a). Then, our model (Fig. 1) was tested using Models 4 and 7 from the PROCESS macro for SPSS (Hayes, 2018). Specifically, we used Model 4 to test whether the relationship between SES and SNS addiction was mediated by active parental mediation (H2c). Then, we used Model 7 to test whether the mediation path was moderated by parents' ICT attitude (H3b). After that, the Johnson-Neyman (J-N) technique was used to interpret any significant interactions for regions of significance (the online tool is available at https://sites.google.com/a/georgiasouthern.edu/stephen-carden/research; Carden et al., 2017). This technique probed the indirect association between SES and active parental mediation at different levels of parents’ ICT attitude. The bootstrapping method with 5000 resamples of the data was used to test the significance of the effect so as to obtain robust standard errors for parameter estimation (Hayes, 2018). The effects are reported with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs). Confidence intervals that do not contain zero indicate a significant finding. This approach had been effectively verified by lots of empirical studies (e.g., Liu et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2019). In addition, gender and age were included as control variables in the regression-based analyses.

4. Results
4.1. Preliminary analysis
Table 1 presents means, standard deviations, and zero-order correlations among all study variables. As expected, SES (r = −0.18, p < 0.01) and active parental mediation (r = −0.20, p < 0.01) were negatively correlated with SNS addiction. Furthermore, SES was positively associated with active parental mediation (r = 0.24, p < 0.01). Finally, parents’ positive ICT attitudes were positively associated with active parental mediation (r = 0.21, p < 0.01). Based on these findings, H1, H2a, H2b, and H3a were supported.

4.2. Test of active parental mediation as a mediator of the relationship between SES and SNS addiction
As shown in Table 2, SES was negatively associated with SNS addiction (β = −0.10, p < 0.01, 95 % CI = [–0.17, −0.04]). The association remained significant after the mediator (active parental mediation) was entered (β = −0.08, p < 0.05, 95 % CI = [–0.15, −0.01]). SES was found to be positively associated with active parental mediation (β = 0.20, p < 0.001, 95 % CI = [–0.17, −0.04]); further, active parental mediation was negatively associated with SNS addiction (β = −0.13, p < 0.01, 95 % CI = [–0.20, −0.06]). Bootstrapping analysis indicated that the indirect effect of SES on SNS addiction through active parental mediation was significant (β = −0.03, 95 % CI = [–0.14, −0.01]). The mediation effect accounted for 30 % of the total effect. Active parental mediation partially mediated the relationship between SES and SNS addiction. Therefore, Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2 were supported (see Fig. 2).

4.3. Test of parents’ ICT attitude as a moderator of the effect of SES on active parental mediation
It can be seen in Table 3 and Fig. 3 that SES (β = 0.17, p < 0.001) and parents' positive ICT attitude (β = 0.20, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with active parental mediation. The interaction between SES and parents' ICT attitude was negative and significant (β = −0.07, p < 0.05), suggesting that parents' positive ICT attitude moderated the influence of SES on active parental mediation. As shown in Fig. 4, the positive relationship between SES and active parental mediation was significant when parents' ICT positive attitude scores were less than or equal to 0.98 (within a confidence band that did not contain zero), and not significantly different from zero when parents' ICT positive attitude scores were greater than 0.98 (within a confidence ban that contained zero). These variables (SES, parents' positive ICT attitude, the interaction between SES and parents’ ICT attitude, and covariates) accounted for 11 % variance in active parental mediation, with 1 % being contributed by the moderating effect (R2 – Change = 0.01). This provided support for H3.

5. Discussion
The present study examined the association between SES and youths' social networking site addiction and its underlying mechanism, namely the mediating role of active parental mediation. In addition, parents' ICT attitude was tested as a moderator in the mediation process. This study could deepen our understanding of the role of family factors (i.e., SES, parental attitude, and active parental mediation) in children and adolescents’ SNS addiction, by shedding light on both how and when SES is associated with SNS addiction. Moreover, the moderated mediation model may inform the design of intervention programs aimed at reducing SNS addiction among children and adolescent.

5.1. SES and SNS addiction
Similar to studies on the influence of SES on internet addiction (Faltýnková et al., 2020; Islam & Hossin, 2016; Urbanova et al., 2019), we found that children and adolescent with high SES had a lower risk of SNS addiction. By itself, this finding is counterintuitive; with greater access to online devices, children in high-SES families could be at greater risk of NS addiction of simply by virtue of spending more time on the internet (Ak et al., 2013; Harris et al., 2017). However, the negative association between SES and children and adolescent’ SNS is easier to interpret when other factors are taken into account. For example, various forms of online activity might fulfill adolescents' psychological needs (e.g., relationship maintenance, entertainment; Koyuncu et al., 2014), reducing the risk of SNS addiction as a way to satisfy these needs (Kardefelt-Winther, 2014). Low-SES youth may have less time on the computer, and so don't tend to meet their psychological needs in that way (presumably leading to a higher risk of SNS as a way to compensate for unmet needs) Thus, more attention should be paid to children and adolescents in a low SES environment.

5.2. The mediating role of active parental mediation
Our findings also showed that active parental mediation mediated the relationship between SES and children and adolescents SNS addiction. This result supports the assumption that parents play crucial roles in preventing children and adolescents' risk of SNS by discussing issues related to the internet, giving advice and guidance, and setting age-appropriate rules. This finding is consistent with the ecological systems model (Bronfenbrenner, 1979, 1986), suggesting that the family SES environment can influence the parental mediation behaviors and children's developmental outcomes.

Regarding the first path in the mediation process (i.e., the association between SES and active parental mediation), our finding echoes previous findings showing that higher SES was associated with more positive parenting (DeGarmo et al., 1999; Emmen et al., 2013). Parents with higher SES have less economical pressure and emotional distress and more child-centered in their parenting (Conger et al., 2002). In this background, they have more time and energy to give their child more verbal and emotional responses (Hoff et al., 2002; Emmen et al., 2013). Thus, it is possible that parents with higher SES are more likely to talk with their children about SNS and to guide them about the risk of SNS addiction (Li et al., 2020). However, SES can be identified by parent's education, occupation and income (Li et al., 2011; McLoyd, 1998), meaning there are likely to be numerous reasons for the association between SES and lower SNS addiction. For example, parents with high SES are likely to be well educated and to have strong online skills, with high understanding of the positive and negative effects of internet use (Álvarez et al., 2013; Barnidge et al., 2019). They might value internet literacy more than other parents do, and therefore invest more in guiding their children's reasonable and healthy internet use, such as searching and processing digital information and looking for classes online (Aesaert & van Braak, 2015; Barnidge et al., 2019; Van Deursen & Van Dijk, 2014).

For the second path in the mediation process (i.e., the association between active parental mediation and SNS addiction), our finding coincides with that of other research showing a negative association between active parental mediation and adolescent mobile phone dependency (Xin et al., 2020). Active parental mediation is related to ICT functions as a form of social support whereby parents provide their children with positive guidance and advice in the use of the internet (Wright & Wachs, 2019), which enables children to discuss their exposure to negative online situations with their parents. Furthermore, active parental mediation involves parents discussing strategies with their children to maximize the benefits and minimize the difficulties in ICT use (Livingstone et al., 2017; Nikken & Jansz, 2006; Symons et al., 2017). Such discussions might help children to become critical consumers of the internet. Therefore, a family environment characterized by high SES could increase the likelihood that parents actively intervene in children's and adolescents' use of the internet, which could further decrease the likelihood of youths' SNS addiction.

5.3. The moderating role of parents’ ICT attitude
In addition, we examined the moderating role of parents' ICT attitude in the first path of the mediation link (association between SES and active parental mediation). Consistent with our Hypothesis, parents' ICT attitude moderated the relation between SES and active parental mediation. Specifically, the relationship between SES and active parental mediation was more robust for parents whose ICT attitude was less positive. This result is also consistent with the ecological systems theory that emphasizes the dynamic interaction between the individual and the context as a contributor to person's psychological and social adaptation (Bronfenbrenner, 1979, 1986). Individuals who have a positive ICT attitude—that is, those who regard ICT as useful and beneficial—have a stronger motivation to use the internet (Mota & Cilento, 2020) and encourage their children to use the it (Bordalba & Bochaca, 2019). They also provide more positive guidance for young adolescents utilizing the internet (Yu et al., 2011).

Notably, parents with a positive attitude will offer ICT resources and pay more to support their children's ICT use and literacy even when they are of low SES. In our sample, as parents' positive ICT attitude increased, the effect of the environment (e.g., SES) on parents' behaviors (e.g., active parent mediation) decreased. This finding suggests that attitude toward ICT could be treated as an individual difference that moderates the association between the environment (SES) and another individual difference, namely active parental mediation. At the same time, parents' attitude could act as a protective factor that attenuates the relationship between a low SES environment and young adolescent problems related to the internet. This result supplements empirical studies showing that children and adolescents' use of information technology is affected by more than one family factor.

5.4. Limitations and implications
Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the results. First, our study used a cross-sectional research design and thus we are unable to infer causal associations. Obtaining data from longitudinal studies and comparing parental impact on the child in different developmental stages (e.g., early and late adolescence) would be valuable for a clearer understanding of our moderated mediation model. Second, information about socioeconomic status was reported by children and adolescents, and they might not be reliable reporters. Therefore, parents' reports of SES would strengthen our findings. Moreover, the measure of SES had low reliability, and the new version of the Family Affluence Scale (FAS III) may have better internal consistency (Hartley et al., 2016) that makes the result precise. Third, our study primarily focused on the effect of family factors (i.e., SES, parents’ attitude and behaviors) on children and adolescent’ SNS addiction. Apart from family factors, positive peer influences are widely considered to be primary sources of protection against the risk of problematic behaviors (Huang et al., 2014). Future research should test a multifactorial model that includes both family factors and peer factors as predictors of youth SNS addiction.

Despite these limitations, this study also has several implications for theory and practice. With regard to theory, the results extend our knowledge of ecological systems theory and the family investment model in relation to child and adolescent SNS addiction. Specifically, our moderated mediation model delineates one route by which family socioeconomic status is associated with youths' SNS addiction, and when this association is more or less pronounced. Furthermore, the present study enriches our understanding of the possible role of family factors (e.g., SES, active parental mediation, parents' ICT attitude) in preventing children and adolescents from developing SNS addiction. With regard to application, we should pay more attention to low-SES and high-SES families individuals, developing an intervention program to improve parent's positive attitude toward information communication technology and to increase parent's engagement behaviors to decrease children and adolescents' internet-related addiction risk.

6. Conclusions
Socioeconomic status negatively predicted children and adolescents' SNS addiction, and this predictive effect was partially mediated by active parental mediation. Parent's ICT attitude moderated the relation between socioeconomic status and active parental meditation. Specifically, the association between SES and active parental mediation was weaker for parents with more positive attitudes toward ICT Thus, improving parents' ICT attitude may decrease the association between low socioeconomic and low active parental mediation, decreasing the risk of children and adolescent's SNS addiction.
