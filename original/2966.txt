This study explored the effects of a Concept Mapping-based Two-tier Test Gaming (CM-TTG) approach on learning achievement. Specifically, the two-tier test was employed as a learning diagnosis tool, and concept maps were utilized as the learning strategies to improve the students' learning achievement. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a quasi-experimental design was applied to compare the learning achievement, learning motivation, flow experience, and cognitive loads of ninth-grade students using the CM-TTG approach and those using the conventional two-tier test-based gaming approach; moreover, the behavioral patterns of the experimental group and the control group using the different approaches as well as low- and high-achievers in the CM-TTG were analyzed as well. The results of the study showed that the concept-mapping strategy used with the two-tier test digital game-based learning could significantly improve the students' learning achievement. There were no significant differences in the learning motivation, flow experience, or cognitive loads of the two groups. Besides, the average scores of the two groups' learning motivation and flow experience were above 3.0, and those of their cognitive load ratings were below 3.0. It is inferred that the CM-TTG approach did not have a significant impact on the students' cognitive load, learning motivation, or flow experience. However, an examination of the participants' learning behavior patterns in the experimental group revealed that there were distinct differences between high-achieving and low-achieving students, as the former would actively build connections between concept maps and learning tasks to help them achieve the learning goals, while the low-achieving students would feel lost in the game without enforced instructions. Finally, through interviews, we analyzed and synthesized key factors impacting the students’ learning achievements with the CM-TTG approach to serve as a reference for future research.

1. Introduction
Educators have emphasized the importance of fostering students' ability to apply interdisciplinary knowledge for problem solving (Ivanitskaya, Clark, Montgomery, & Primeau, 2002). Integrative activities refer to the learning tasks engaging students in developing projects or solving problems using the knowledge and skills learned from multiple courses (Bannan-Ritland, 2003). The educational objective of integrative activities is to cultivate students' capability of value exploration, experience integration, and practice innovation, as well as to stress their real-life experience and establish integrated concepts across disciplines (Klein, 2005). On the other hand, researchers have indicated that students generally encounter difficulties in doing learning tasks owing to the lack of experience in applying multi-disciplinary knowledge (Stentoft, 2017). Several scholars have further emphasized the need to provide appropriate instructional means and tools to help students improve their performance in integrative activities as well as promoting their emotional development in their life management (Anderson & Valero, 2020; Ferreira, Martinsone, & Talić, 2020). Situating students in the contexts related to the learning content to enable them to acquire knowledge through the learning cycle of experience, reflection, conceptualization, and practice has been highlighted (Kolb, 1984). Among various approaches that engage students in authentic learning contexts, digital game-based learning, which provides learners with joyful, interactive, and challenging learning contexts while enabling them to experience and apply knowledge, has been recognized as an effective approach (Chen, Liu, & Shou, 2018). Several previous studies have reported the potential of digital game-based learning for improving learners' performances, motivation, and flow experience (Hung, Sun, & Yu, 2015; Chang, Warden, Liang, & Lin, 2018a, 2018b). On the other hand, researchers have indicated the weaknesses of the conventional DGBL approach, including improvised evaluation via multiple-choice questions that might be answered by learners with lucky guesses, being unable to detect learners’ misconceptions (Deng, Wu, Chen, & Peng, 2020), and the lack of support to enable learners to have a whole picture of the learning content embedded in the gaming contexts (Consalvo, 2009). As a consequence, it is important to reconsider the way of developing DGBL systems.

Several attempts have been made to incorporate effective learning strategies into educational computer games. Among the adopted strategies, the two-tier test has been recognized by scholars as a systematic and effective method that can be implemented in digital learning environments to evaluate students' learning performance as well as their possible misconceptions (Chu & Chang, 2014). It refers to the use of two levels of test items to check the reliability of students' answers as well as to find students' potential misconceptions (Treagust, 1988). On one hand, it allows teachers to evaluate students' learning progress and outcomes more precisely than using conventional tests; on the other hand, it fosters students’ reasoning ability and other higher order thinking skills via guiding them to consider the reasons for giving their answers. Previous studies have reported that when two-tier questioning was integrated into digital-based learning, students would gain better outcomes and enhanced motivation (Yang, Fu, Hwang, & Yang, 2017).

In addition, the complex and advanced knowledge embedded in the gaming contexts need to be acquired with the assistance of proper learning tools (Boyle, 2002). Several researchers have advocated that digital-based learning using cognitive tools can help learners effectively organize and synthesize knowledge (Chang & Yeh, 2021; Gudadappanavar, Benni, & Javali, 2021; Shah & Foster, 2015). Concept mapping is one of the cognitive tools that can help students with content review and organization. Students may use nodes as their prerequisite knowledge or new content, and they can use lines to indicate the relationships between the nodes. Besides, it is also an effective knowledge construction tool that strengthens students' cognition (Hwang, Lai, & Wang, 2015; Novak & Gowin, 1984; Roy, 2021). On the other hand, researchers have indicated the importance of situating learners in a flow state, that is, the mental state in which learners are fully immersed in a feeling of energetic focus, involvement, and enjoyment in the process of a learning activity (Czikszentmihalyi, 1990). Hung et al. (2015) found that students gained better flow experience and improved performance when playing games on tablets. Therefore, employing a concept map in a digital game-based learning activity could be a promising way to improve students’ learning outcomes and motivation, and to reduce their cognitive load.

2. Literature review
2.1. Digital game-based learning
Digital game-based learning (DGBL) refers to the use of digital games as a means to facilitate learning by integrating learning content into computer games, or to use computer games to achieve educational purposes (Erhel & Jamet, 2013). Perini, Luglietti, Margoudi, Oliveira, and Taisch (2018) noted that DGBL can not only engage learners in procedural learning, but can also deepen their understanding of textbook content so as to solve more complicated problems (Chen & Lin, 2016).

Kiili (2005) argued that educational games were designed to engage and motivate players through direct experience of the game world, and proposed an experiential gaming model that promoted mind-flow experiences, which emphasized the importance of designing and balancing challenges in order to provide the best learning experience for players. Prensky (2008) suggested that the best way to design educational games was to first observe and extract defining characteristics in successful games, and then apply them in subject learning design.

On the other hand, several studies have reported the challenges of DGBL (Hébert, Jenson, & Terzopoulos, 2021; Huang, Johnson, & Han, 2013). Hsu (2017) noted that students’ learning interest and participation willingness might be discounted if they experienced repeated failures without constructive feedback. In other words, the absence of effective learning instructions in DGBL could still result in unsatisfactory learning outcomes. For example, Papastergiou (2009) suggested that when students get wrong answers, they should be given a hint instead of just guessing, which can help them better understand the learning content. Therefore, it is paramount to integrate effective strategies or tools while applying DGBL.

2.2. Two-tier test
In traditional testing, it is difficult to determine whether students scored because they truly knew the answer or if they simply guessed. To address this problem, a two-tier test approach consisting of two rounds of multiple choice questions has been proposed (Treagust, 1988), and it has been considered an effective way to diagnose students' learning status ever since (Tsai, 2003). The first tier of the test aims to examine students' descriptive or factual knowledge of a given entity or phenomenon (e.g., certain plants' characteristics), whereas the second tier is often used to elicit students’ explanations for how they made their earlier choices in the first tier (e.g., how things function and why), and then to provide feedback on their responses. If students do not answer correctly, they will be prompted to study the relevant materials again.

Despite the fact that students' learning process can also be assessed through interviews, such means can be time-consuming and cumbersome (Lin, 2016). In recent years, with the help of technologies, teachers have been able to employ a two-tier test system through DGBL to understand learners’ learning status, clear up their misunderstandings, and maximize their learning outcomes (Chu & Chang, 2014; Lin, 2016).

2.3. Concept mapping
While text description assists the understanding of abstract constructs, it is limited in terms of efficiently and precisely portraying the interactive relationships between and among multiple constructs. A concept map is one type of graphic organizer that helps learners visualize, organize, and retain knowledge (Novak & Gowin, 1984). Previously, concept mapping has been applied in instructional design (Atapattu, Falkner, & Falkner, 2017; Islim, 2018). Chiou (2008), who applied it in a college accounting course, found that concept mapping could greatly enhance students' learning achievement, and help them organize their knowledge systematically. The study examined two concept map structures which demonstrated that the hierarchical concept map supported learners to put less mental effort into the learning process, whereas the network concept map disoriented those learners with lower prior knowledge (Amadieu, Van Gog, Paas, Tricot, & Mariné, 2009). Researchers have combined computer-supported concept maps and interviews to construct and produce personal professional theories, and have found that this approach improved quality and promoted learning (Van den Bogaart, Bilderbeek, Schaap, Hummel, & Kirschner, 2016; Van den Bogaart, Schaap, Hummel, & Kirschner, 2017). Chen, Huang, and Chou (2019) proposed an AR-based multidimensional concept map in a natural science course which showed that students' learning achievement, motivation, and acceptance significantly improved. Chiou, Tien, and Tang (2020) employed a computer-assisted collaborative concept mapping (SCACCM) strategy in a flipped classroom and found it effective in terms of improving students’ learning achievement and learning motivation.

Despite this, concept mapping is not always effective, as presented by Charsky and Ressler (2011), who described how using concept mapping in digital game-based learning without properly incorporating it into the game design could result in less satisfactory results than those of learners who did not use it. Specifically, when students consider that the concept mapping is irrelevant to gaming tasks, they could treat it as an interference of game playing, hence leading to low learning motivation or performance. In other words, concept mapping can only be effective when used with proper instructional design and game design. Drawing upon such experiences, Hwang, Yang, and Wang (2013) experimented with how concept mapping could be used in nature courses to improve students’ learning outcomes and reduce their cognitive load.

To sum up, the use of concept maps in learning enables students to form a more comprehensive and systematic knowledge structure; however, it is vital to choose the appropriate and conducive instructional design, without which student learning effectiveness could not be ensured. In the present study, we have synthesized both positive and negative findings, and sought to design cognitive learning tools that could help students with knowledge organization, conceptual relationship building, and active learning.

2.4. Flow experience
Csikszentmihalyi (1975) proposed the “Flow Theory,” which refers to game players' positive feelings when immersed in gaming contexts. Kiili (2005) stated that it was more important to identify factors that led to the flow experience than to identify the exact flow moments. By referring to Vygotsky's (1962) Zone of Proximal Development, Kiili (2005) summarized three mental states of game players based on the challenging level of the game and the skill level of the player, as shown in Fig. 1. When the level of difficulty is higher than the level of player ability, then the player would feel anxious; on the contrary, when the level of player ability is higher, then the player would feel bored. In other words, the two must be congruent with each other, so as to maximize and lengthen the players' flow experience.

In Hamari et al.’s (2016) study, they applied a digital game to help students learn optics, and found that flow experience and the feeling of immersion had a positive impact on student learning. Hung et al. (2015) found that students who played a challenging tablet PC game gained better flow experience, improved performance, and increased satisfaction than those who played a matching tablet PC game. Hwang and Chang (2020) applied game-based learning in a flipped nursing course and concluded that such strategies could increase students' flow experience, and enhance their learning motivation as well as performance.

To sum up, flow experience is conducive to student learning in game-based learning. In the present study, we have integrated Kiili's (2005) flow experience model as a scaffold to support DGBL to help students gain better flow experience and achievement.

2.5. Cognitive load
Cognitive load refers to the amount of information that is held in limited working memory at one time. When learners try to memorize content or acquire new knowledge and skills, if the amount of load exceeds the learner's short-term memory limitations, the learner will be distracted rather than facilitated in learning (Sweller, Van Merrienboer, & Paas, 1998).

The inappropriate presentation of multimedia learning materials is one of the key causes of learners' cognitive overload (Kiili, 2005). Mayer (2001) proposed that in multimedia learning design, the most important task was not to accommodate as many resources as possible, but to provide only the truly necessary content. Sweller (1998) identified three types of cognitive load, namely intrinsic cognitive load, extraneous cognitive load, and germane cognitive load. Paas and van Merriënboer (1994) specified that mental load referred to the cognitive load caused by the interrelationships between the learning environment and learner characteristics, whereas mental effort represented the cognitive load derived from learners' attempts to complete tasks. Both cognitive load and the presentation of content are intertwined with teachers’ instructional strategies.

Chu (2014) argued that in an experiential learning environment, students could feel more cognitively loaded because they had to invest more time and energy when observing temples in reality than when simply reading materials in the classroom. Liao, Chen, and Shih (2019) noted that instructional videos that were congruent with multimedia learning principles were helpful for reducing cognitive load during DGBL.

As for instructional game designers, the most important point is to control the players' extraneous load and increase their germane load (Wu, Tzeng, & Huang, 2020). For example, it is important to carefully organize the learning content in gaming contexts so as to reduce learners’ extraneous load, while at the same time maintaining a proper level of challenge. Teachers must understand students' prior knowledge, eliminate the unnecessary extraneous load, and present the material in a step-by-step manner to increase the students' germane load while maintaining a certain level of challenge.

As has been indicated in the above literature review, DGBL has been applied widely in various fields of study, including natural science (Sung & Hwang, 2013, Sung, Hwang, Wu, & Lin, 2018), language learning (Pitarch, 2018; Yukselturk, Altıok, & Başer, 2018), mathematics courses (Hwa, 2018), and nursing education (Hwang & Chang, 2020). Moreover, many studies have reported the potential effect of DGBL on students’ learning achievement, motivation, flow experience, and cognitive load. For example, Liao et al. (2019) developed a digital game-based learning environment and found the learning achievement and motivation significantly improved, while the cognitive load was reduced. Chang et al. (2018a, 2018b) also reported that DGBL can facilitate flow and is helpful for learning, leads to significantly better learning achievement, and lowers cognitive load. To sum up, evaluating the effectiveness of this CM-TTG approach in terms of learning achievement, motivation, flow experience, and cognitive load is meaningful.

Therefore, in this study, a concept mapping-based two-tier test gaming (CM-TTG) approach is proposed. Moreover, a digital game for the “Healthy eating habits” unit of the Home Economics course, one of the integrative activity curricula, was implemented based on the proposed approach. To evaluate the effectiveness of this novel approach, we sought to answer the following research questions:

(1)
Do students who participate in CM-TTG differ statistically significantly in their learning motivation from those who participate in Two-tier Test Gaming (TTG)?

(2)
Does the CM-TTG produce better learning achievement than the TTG approach?

(3)
Do students who participate in CM-TTG differ statistically significantly in their flow experience and cognitive load from those in TTG?

(4)
What are the differences between the learning behaviors of the students learning with CM-TTG and TTG? What are the differences between the learning behaviors of the low- and high-achievers in the CM-TTG group?

3. The CM-TTG approach
Using the RPG Maker, which is a role-play game implementing tool developed by the Japanese company Enterbrain in 1992 for making RPGs without programming knowledge, we developed a DGBL system that integrated both concept mapping and two-tier testing. It was used to facilitate student learning of “Food Master” based on the learning content of “Healthy eating habits” in the food additives unit of the Home Economics course for ninth-graders, in which they became familiar with all kinds of food additives. The course design was a collaborative outcome between the lead researchers of this study and the course teacher, who specifically ensured the congruence between the DGBL and the school curriculum.

As shown in Fig. 2, the system consists of two-tier testing, a DGBL module, and a concept mapping module. The DGBL module was used to store the learning materials, including text, images, and learning logs, such as completed tasks, incomplete tasks, collected resources, and test records. The concept mapping module was derived from the concept maps created by the teachers which exhibited the relationship between and among various concepts in DGBL. Learners could fill in blanks in concept maps and synthesize knowledge points regarding food additives.

Fig. 2. Structure of the DGBL learning system.

For the learners to truly grasp the knowledge of food additives, the system requested that the learners take the two-tier test after they had acquired the learning materials. The two-tier test could provide teachers with information regarding the learners' learning status, and record learners’ progress in the database. There were 16 test items in the present study, the procedure of which is displayed in Fig. 3.

In this game, learners played the role of adventurers who needed to perform a series of tasks to complete a mission. During the game, the learners acquired knowledge about food additives, including their purpose, functions, and usage, through a series of adventures. Additionally, the students were frequently reminded of what to do and what was done in the form of lists. When the learners arrived at the target point, they were asked to read the designated materials, view the concept puzzles, and answer given questions in the game. Through this collecting and testing process, the learners would strengthen their memory of the key knowledge. The game interface is shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7.

Fig. 7. The two-tier test interface.

As shown in Fig. 4, in the game, all islands and gates were named after the six functions of food additives (e.g., Yan Cun Island represents delaying the expiration date function; Fang Bian island was named after the function of convenient production), which were also important concepts in the concept map. The learners had to follow the gaming plot and visit each island in the given order. At each gate, they had to acquire the corresponding knowledge. For example, when they were on Yan Cun island, they learned about frequently used food additives to keep food fresh for as long as possible, including types, functions, and limitations.

Fig. 5 demonstrates how learners extracted key concepts through reading, images, or dialogue between characters in the game. For example, students needed to trigger the characters to get the learning content through the dialogue, the characters provided the learning content to support students to answer the questions. Fig. 6 exhibits how the learners were guided through concept mapping strategies, so as to build structural connections among the content.

Fig. 7 shows the gaming interface of the two-tier test, which examined whether student learning was effective or not by examining the reason for providing the first-tier answer using the second-tier question. That is, students needed to answer the second-tier question to describe detailed reasons based on the first-tier answer. For example, a first-tier question might be, “The manufacturer adds hydrogen peroxide in the process of making noodles. Can such products be purchased?” This is a yes-or-no question. The correct answer is “No, they can't.” If learners answered it correctly, they would receive five gold coins, and enter the second round to answer a multiple-choice question: “Can you elaborate on why you made that choice in the last question?” The learners would receive 10 gold coins only when they answered this question correctly as well. The system would determine the next test item, and if they answered it incorrectly, they would lose five gold coins, and the test would be paused automatically until the learners re-read the given materials and took the test from the beginning again.

4. Method
4.1. Participants
The participants were four classes of ninth-grade students from a junior high school in northern Taiwan (between 14 and 15 years old). A total of 97 students persisted through the study. A quasi-experimental design was employed, with 50 students (24 males, 26 females) in the experimental group, and 47 (25 males and 22 females) in the control group. The former adopted the CM-TTG approach, while the latter used the two-tier test integrated DGBL without concept mapping. The students had previous knowledge about food safety assessment, improvement strategies, and food poison prevention in their health and physical education course. The course in this study aimed to help students get familiar with food labels, processing, utilization, and food safety insurance practices. The main learning content was food additives.

4.2. Experiment procedures
As shown in Fig. 8, both groups took a pre-test of course knowledge and completed pre-questionnaires followed by CM-TTG for the experimental group and the two-tier test DGBL approach for the control group. After the course ended, both groups took a post-test and completed post-questionnaires measuring their flow experience, cognitive load, and learning motivation. A total of six students (three high-achievers and three low-achievers) were randomly selected from both groups for an interview.

4.3. Measuring tools
The measuring tools adopted in this study included a pre-test, a post-test, and the questionnaires of learning motivation, flow experience, and cognitive load. The tools were examined by two experienced teachers who had taught the course for more than 10 years to ensure that individual items were comprehensible to the participants.

The pre-test knowledge test was designed based on “food processing, additives, and safety,” including five True or False questions and 20 multiple-choice questions, with a perfect score of 100. The KR20 of the pre-test was 0.74. The post-test was co-designed by the researcher and field experts, and consisted of items assessing students’ DGBL experience of understanding and memorization of food processing, additives, and usage. The post-test took the form of 15 multiple-choice questions and four short-answer questions, with a perfect score of 100. The KR20 of the post-test was 0.82.

The learning motivation questionnaire was adopted from Wang and Chen's (2010) study, in which they modified Pintrich, Smith, Garcia, and McKeachie's (1993) scale. The original questionnaire included six questions in two dimensions: Three of them were about intrinsic motivation (e.g., “In a class like this, I prefer course material that really challenges me so I can learn new things”), and the other three were for extrinsic motivation (e.g., “If I can, I want to get better grades in this class than most of the other students”). It took the form of a 5-point Likert scale, and the Cronbach's α value was 0.79.

The questionnaire about flow experience was derived from Pearce, Ainley, and Howard's (2005) scale. It consists of eight items (e.g., “I was absorbed intensely by the activity” and “I found the activity enjoyable”) and took the form of a 5-point Likert scale with a Cronbach's α value of 0.79.

The cognitive load measurement scale was cited from Hwang et al. (2013) study. The instrument includes eight questions in two dimensions. Specifically, there are five questions about mental load (e.g., “The learning content in this learning activity was difficult for me”), and three for mental efforts (e.g., “I need to put lots of effort into completing the learning tasks or achieving the learning objectives in this learning activity”). It also took the form of a 5-point Likert scale with a Cronbach's α value of 0.86.

We modified a series of interview questions regarding students' experience of DGBL based on Hwang, Yang, Tsai, and Yang (2009) study, which included the following questions.

(1)
In what ways did this method benefit you most in learning about food additives? Please explain your answers by giving examples.

(2)
How is learning about food additives in this way different from the other class you have experienced (or expected) before? Do you think it works? Why? How can it help you?

(3)
To sum up, what are the benefits of this learning method?

(4)
What can be improved in this method (for example: system function or interface design)? Please give specific examples.

(5)
Do you hope to have the opportunity to learn in this way again in the future? What courses could it be? Why do you think these courses are suitable for this method?

(6)
Would you recommend this learning method to other students? Why do you think they need to learn in this way? Or would they like to learn in this way?

(7)
Would you recommend that other teachers teach in this way? Why do you think they need such a teaching method? Or would they like to use this teaching method?

The questionnaires and the interview questions were examined by two experts who were experienced in developing measuring tools to confirm their validity. Moreover, two experienced teachers were asked to check whether the wording used in the questionnaire and interview items was comprehensible to the students.

4.4. The coding scheme for DGBL behavioral patterns
In order to analyze the students’ DGBL behaviors, we coded according to the manner illustrated in Table 1.

5. Results
5.1. Learning motivation
The present study employed ANCOVA using the learning motivation pre-questionnaire as the covariate to analyze the two groups' learning motivation. According to the test of homogeneity regression, there was no significant difference between the two groups' questionnaire of learning motivation (F (2, 93) = 2.86, p = 0.06). One-way ANCOVA was then employed. The results are shown in Table 2. The adjusted means and standard error of the experimental group were 3.51 and 0.14, whereas those for the control group were 3.66 and 0.14. The result showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the groups (F (1, 94) = 0.61, p = 0.44), which means that the concept mapping and two-tier test integrated DGBL would not impact students’ learning motivation. However, the average learning motivation of both groups was higher than 3. It is therefore inferred that the two groups of students had a very positive attitude towards the two-tier test integrated DGBL.

Group	N	Mean	S.D.	Adjusted mean	Std. error	F
Experimental group	50	3.52	1.02	3.51	0.14	0.61
Control group	47	3.66	0.93	3.66	0.14	
5.2. Learning achievement
The present study employed ANCOVA using the pre-test scores as the covariate to analyze the students' learning achievement. According to the test of homogeneity regression, there is no significant difference between the two groups' learning achievement (F (1, 93) = 2.00, p = 0.16). One-way ANCOVA was then employed. The results are shown in Table 3. The adjusted means and standard error of the experimental group were 71.07 and 2.30, whereas those of the control group were 62.90 and 2.37. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (F (1, 94) = 5.97, p = 0.02). Moreover, according to Cohen's (1988) criteria, the partial eta-squared (η2) was 0.06 for the two groups' learning achievement, which represents a medium effect size. The result indicated that the experimental group with concept mapping and two-tier test integrated DGBL outperformed the control group with the two-tier test integrated DGBL in terms of learning achievement.

*p < 0.05.

5.3. Cognitive load
An independent samples t-test was conducted to investigate the two groups' cognitive load. The results are displayed in Table 4. The means of the cognitive load were respectively 3.08 for the experimental group and 2.74 for the control group (t (93) = −1.34，p = 0.18), those of mental load were 3.06 and 2.72 (t (95) = −1.26，p = 0.21), and those of mental efforts were 2.96 and 2.62 (t (95) = −1.27，p = 0.21). There was no statistically significant difference in the two groups’ cognitive load, mental load, or mental effort. These results indicate that the two groups of students had the same cognitive load for participating in the two-tier test integrated DGBL.

5.4. Flow experience
An independent samples t-test was used to examine the two groups' flow experience. The results are displayed in Table 5. The means of the flow experience were respectively 3.79 for the experimental group and 4.10 for the control group. There was no statistically significant difference between groups in terms of their flow experience (t (91) = 1.67，p = 0.1). Additionally, both groups’ means exceeded 3.0, which indicates that both groups of students felt considerably positive about the two-tier test integrated DGBL.

5.5. Learning behavioral analysis
To understand the learning process of learners in different digital game learning modes, this research recorded the learning behaviors of the learners when playing the game using lag sequential analysis with the GSEQ software (Bakeman & Quera, 1995). Lag sequential analysis is a method of analyzing the sequential dependency in a serially sequenced series of codes, and enables one to summarize cross-dependencies occurring in complex interactive sequences of behavior. Since the experimental group was guided to the CM-TTG learning mode, the item “reading concept map (H)" was added to the coding list. The results are displayed in Table 6.

Table 6 demonstrates the sequential analysis of the experimental group participants' learning behaviors, among which 27 were statistically meaningful. Table 7 lists the sequential analysis of the control group participants’ learning behaviors, among which 23 were statistically meaningful since the z-score of these sequences was higher than 1.96 (Bakeman & Gottman, 1997). For example, H→H means that the participants repeatedly read the concept maps. G→Z means that the learners answered the second-tier question correctly but did not complete the learning objectives, then returned to the trial hall and started the quiz. Y→Y indicates that the participants persistently escaped from the fighting.

It can be seen in Fig. 9 that the experimental students would first explore the scenarios, and then check the concept maps (A→H), and even repeat it again and again (H→H), and read the designated materials (H→R). Besides, when they anchored the fighting in the game while they were exploring, they chose to escape (A→Y). This might imply that the experimental students tended to read the concept puzzles repeatedly before they got the learning content and joined the fighting scenario. On the contrary, students in the control group would fight first (A→X), and then read the related materials (X→R). This means that the students in the control group chose to give priority to the game experience, as shown in Fig. 10.

Furthermore, we identified the median of the experimental group students’ pre-test scores, and divided the group into the high-achievement group and low-achievement group to study their learning behavioral differences. The median was 52; therefore, those who scored higher than 52 were grouped as the high-achievers, and the others were low-achievers.

Table 8 displays the sequential analysis results of the high-achievers in the experimental group, among which only 24 were statistically meaningful because their z-scores were higher than 1.96 (Bakeman & Gottman, 1997). For example, R→R refers to students reading the learning materials over again, T→G means students answered two tiers of questions correctly, and F→Z suggests that the students chose to answer a question again after they failed once.

Table 9 shows the sequential analysis results of the low-achievers in the experimental group, among which 29 were statistically meaningful. For instance, A→A refers to students who chose to explore a scenario again, K→H means that students familiarized themselves with the learning tasks and then viewed the concept maps, while X→X means that they continued to fight in the game and won the game.

Based on Table 8, Table 9, the behavioral paths were constructed as shown in Fig. 11. The black lines represent important sequences that were happening simultaneously in the two groups, while the red lines indicate important sequences that only exist in the high- or low-achievement groups. It can be seen in Fig. 11 that high-achievement students in the experimental group would like to accept and explore new objectives after completing an objective (K→A), and then check the concept maps (A→H), and read the learning materials (H→R). Besides, when they triggered the fighting in the game after they read the learning materials, they chose to escape (R→Y), and then to accept and explore new objectives (Y→A). This could imply that high-achievers tended to repeatedly check the concept puzzles before obtaining the learning materials and joined the fighting scenario to complete the learning tasks.

Fig. 11. The learning behavioral paths of the high- and low-achievement students in the experimental group.

It can also be seen in Fig. 11 that the red lines in the low-achievers group indicate that the low-achievers would view the concept map first after receiving the learning objectives (K→H), then explore the scenarios (H→A) and read the concept map repeatedly (H→A, A→H), and finally read the learning materials (A→R). Additionally, when a battle in the game was triggered, they chose to fight and explore repeatedly (X→A, A→X), and then read the learning materials (A→R). Similarly, some students would enter the fight repeatedly (X→X) until they gave up and escaped (X→Y), and then read the learning materials (Y→R). That is, the low-achievers not only tried to explore, but also repeatedly read the concept map before reading the learning materials. By comparing the behavioral patterns of the high- and low-achievers, it seems that the low-achievers relied on the concept map more than did the high-achievers.

To sum up, comparing the behavioral patterns of the experimental and control groups, we found that the students in the experimental group would view the concept map multiple times before they read the learning materials. The learning behavior indicated that concept maps were useful for student learning. An in-depth analysis of the high-achievers’ and low-achievers’ behavioral patterns in the experimental group revealed that the former would try to identify the relationships among the learning objectives, exploring scenarios and learning tasks, and were able to actively use the concept maps to facilitate their learning process. On the contrary, the low-achievers failed to locate such relationships.

5.6. Interview
In order to probe the response of participants to the proposed approach, we conducted a 45-min interview by randomly selecting 3 low-achievers and 3 high-achievers from both groups. The grounded theory proposed by Glaser and Strauss (1967) was applied to examine the interview data in the current study. The essential analytical policies included categorizing the qualitative data, recording the research process, summarizing the details, and validating the critical factors (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). Therefore, according to grounded theory, we could infer the key factors of the proposed approach on both groups’ learning perceptions and performance through interviews.

5.6.1. Interview of the experimental group
Based on the interviews, the six participants in the experimental group recapitulated their learning perceptions and performance of the CM-TTG approach into three aspects, namely increasing learning motivation, improving learning efficiency, and fostering learning reflection.

In terms of increasing learning motivation, the students expressed that they were more motivated to complete the learning tasks, and were more engaged in learning compared with their prior learning experience. Both the high-achievers and low-achievers expressed their positive attitudes towards the design of this learning activity. For example, ES1 stated, “I felt it was really interesting, and it was definitely more interesting than before. I was so surprised and I think it was a novel way to learn”; ES2 considered this activity “… more fun because if the teacher was lecturing, nobody would be listening; with DGBL (I felt) there are tasks to be completed, and I felt more obliged to finish them.”

As for improving learning efficiency, the majority of students would agree that concept mapping was helpful for organizing materials, memorizing learning content, and reviewing knowledge afterward. For instance, ES1 (low achiever) specified that, “I would view the concept map when answering questions in the game because I would forget some of the knowledge … when it presented … an image would come to my mind”; ES3 (low achiever) specified that, “The concept map is useful for me to complete the learning tasks; it reminds me of the relationship between the pieces of knowledge I have learned”; ES6 (high achiever) stated that “The concept map seems to be helpful because I would recall the content in the concept map when taking the test”; ES4 (high-achiever) indicated that, “I think concept mapping is about systematically organizing because when you acquire a knowledge point, it helps you adhere to that, and when you acquire another one, it does that again to remind you what you just learned.”

The interviewees generally believed that the two-tier test mechanism allowed them to reflect on the questions asked. For example, ES2 thought that “the first-tier test was about common sense, and the second-tier test were questions that you must distinguish with more advanced knowledge.” ES3 said that “the two-tier test was very useful because it forced me to understand in-depth.” ES1 noted that “the first-tier test would be completed intuitively, while the second-tier test would allow me to reflect more deeply.” ES4 also acknowledged the value of the two-tier test, stating that “I think it is great! It allows me to understand why, because if it were only one question, I would not even bother finding out why.”

5.6.2. Interview of the control group
There were also three perceptions expressed by students from the control group interviews, namely stimulating learning motivation, fostering engagement, and increasing learning outcomes.

In terms of stimulating learning motivation, CS1 stated that “It is great to learn and play games at the same time. This is better than traditional learning.” CS5 thought that DGBL was “more interesting than boring classes.” CS2 preferred DGBL as well, stating that, “It was awesome because nowadays many students do not like reading books. They feel bored and irritated if they are asked to read. But if you use DGBL, students would feel it is more fun, and are more likely to stick with the class and learn more knowledge, instead of feeling bored.” CS3 noted that, “DGBL was very novel because I had never seen any teacher that would go so far as to design a complete game to teach a lesson. This has been intriguing.” CS4 believed that DGBL was great, “not dull at all, and a satisfactory way to learn.”

When it comes to the sense of engagement, we inferred from their responses that DGBL allowed the students to participate more. For example, CS6 concurred that, “DGBL was very different from paper-and-pencil learning because I could gain a sense of achievement.” CS1 claimed that “I liked playing that kind of learning game, and I think it is an apt way to learn, especially for those who are independent thinkers that do not like talking much or getting involved in group discussion, because you would not be marginalized in a game.” CS2 pointed out that “conventional learning is based on a routine day after day, and students feel bored of such learning, but DGBL would inspire students to learn on their own.”

Most students concurred that DGBL maximized their learning outcomes. For instance, CS2 noted that “you can always go back and check if you answered the first question incorrectly.” CS5 thought the two-tier test was very helpful, because “it was an effective way to detect if you got the answer by guessing or not because people wouldn't be that lucky to guess two consecutive questions correctly.” CS6 pointed out that “you must read the materials to pass, which kind of forced you to memorize and learn.”

To sum up, the control group students emphasized the benefits of DGBL, such as stimulating learning motivation and a sense of achievement, as well as the assistance of the two-tier test, which helped them grasp the key content and maximize the learning outcomes. On the other hand, the experimental group which integrated concept maps reflected that the activity helped them systematically organize the materials, and afterward recall the learning content in the form of images to optimize their learning effectiveness. Therefore, the study concluded that the concept map and two-tier test integrated DGBL were valuable for constructing students’ learning schema, enhancing their learning effectiveness, and fostering active learners.

The interviewees also mentioned how this activity could be further improved in future teaching. First of all, the game plot could be more diverse, rich, and coherent. For example, the test mode of each level was the same, which could result in gaming tiredness that undermines learning motivation. Secondly, researchers may improve the rewarding strategies. Although players can get gold coins by answering questions correctly, the gold coins earned could not be spent to purchase useful gadgets, such as personas or tools; besides, the number of gold coins did not change drastically as a result of the gaming results, which thus had little impact on the students’ tendency to adjust their learning pace or preparedness. Thirdly, despite effective highlights and illustrations, there was too much learning content on one screen, which was burdensome for students to remember. The interface of the game may be re-designed to reduce the learning content or to divide long paragraphs into short ones in the future.

6. Discussion and conclusions
In this study, the CM-TTG approach is proposed and a quasi-experiment was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach in the “Healthy eating habits” course. The results showed that the proposed method improved the students' learning achievement more than the approach. On the other hand, there were no significant differences between the learning motivation, flow experience, or cognitive loads of the two groups. Moreover, the analysis results of the participants’ learning behaviors revealed that the proposed method could support students to actively build connections between concept maps and learning tasks, and hence help them achieve the learning goals.

First of all, it can be seen from the findings that the two comparison groups did not differ statistically significantly in their post-test learning motivation, but there was a statistically significant difference in the learning achievements of the two groups. This finding was contradictory to our earlier hypothesis which stated that the experimental group would have higher learning motivation than the control group. However, it was consistent with the finding of Hwang et al. (2013) study, in which they also utilized the two-tier test and DGBL and did not find differing learning motivations. In other words, the concept mapping addition did not undermine the students’ learning motivation in the least, whereas it statistically significantly improved their learning achievement.

During the interviews, both groups were positive about the two-tier test, which propelled them to think clearly about their answers or choices. The experimental group emphasized that the use of concept maps helped them build connections among food additives, and recall vivid memories when taking the tests. Therefore, the CM-TTG approach was effective in terms of scaffolding student learning so that they could clarify their thoughts and present abstract and complex ideas in visual and relational manners. Hence, it could be inferred that concept maps would result in better learning achievement. This is in a line with previous research which found that concept maps improved students’ learning achievement (Chen et al., 2019; Chiou et al., 2020). Specifically, the high achievers in the experimental group were more effective in terms of utilizing the concept maps.

The cognitive load statistics show that the mean of the mental load of the experimental group was 3.06 and that of the control group was 2.74. This indicates that the learning content and the tasks were moderately challenging, and neither group considered DGBL to be cognitively overloading. In terms of mental effort, the mean of the experimental group was 2.96 and that of the control group was 2.62. This suggests that the presentation of learning content or the number of instructions were also acceptable, and did not impose too much burden on their cognitive information processing. It should be noted that some interviewees indicated that the amount of text on the screen of the learning system could increase their burden of comprehending the content. Therefore, we advocate that in future designs, researchers or teachers may adhere to Mayer's (2001) multimedia learning theory and craft text correspondingly to reduce distraction.

There was no statistically significant difference in the two groups' flow experience. The mean of the experimental group was 3.79, and it was 4.10 for the control group, indicating that the two-tier test integrated DGBL was conducive to students' flow experience, and the addition of concept maps did not decrease the students’ flow experience while they were engaged in learning. Previous research has pointed out that gaming engagement was positively correlated with student learning (Hsu, Tsai, & Wang, 2012), and the learning challenges built into the DGBL enhanced flow experience, learning effectiveness, and student satisfaction (Hamari et al., 2016; Hung et al., 2015).

Finally, in terms of learning behavior, it was found that the experimental group would take advantage of the concept maps, while the control group often chose to play the game before they delved into the learning process. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the high-achievers in the experimental group would attempt to seek connections between the game scenarios and the learning objectives, and then view the concept maps and the learning materials to help them complete the tasks; however, the low-achievers seemed to rely on the concept maps more than did the high-achievers when dealing with the gaming tasks. It could be seen from the behavioral patterns that the majority of low-achievers in the experimental group tended to repeatedly read the concept maps right after starting a new task rather than trying to explore and build effective connections between the concept maps and the learning materials. On the other hand, the high-achievers tended to explore before reading the concept maps. This could be evident from the interview results. Although both the high- and low-achievers in the experimental group agreed that the use of concept maps benefited their learning efficiency, they perceived the usefulness of the concept maps from different perspectives; that is, the low-achievers mainly perceived the concept maps as a tool to help them memorize the content and complete the learning tasks, and hence they tended to read the concept maps after starting a new task. On the other hand, the high-achievers perceived the concept maps as a tool to organize what they had learned, and hence they tended to explore them after receiving a new task.

To sum up, the comparative analysis of both groups indicated that with the two-tier test applied, the strategy of systematically organizing knowledge was more conducive to student learning; also, effective learning strategies would not yield optimal results if instructions were not clear, especially for the low achieving students. These results were consistent with Sung et al. (2018)finding which pointed out that high-achievers tended to actively search for information that facilitated problem-solving, whereas low achievers would tend to complete the learning task without any strategy. In other words, students were able to practice multiple times with the two-tier test. Therefore, it is suggested that in authentic instructional designs, teachers should strive to create well-articulated instructions for low-achievers.

On the other hand, there are some limitations of the present study. First, the experiment was conducted in a Home Economics course of a junior high school in Taiwan; therefore, the findings might not be used to represent the use of concept map-based gaming in other courses or for students in other grades. Second, the sample size of the study was not large and the experimental period was not long, and hence follow-up studies could be required to collect more evidence to show the impacts of the proposed approach on students' learning achievements and behaviors. Third, the findings from the questionnaires and interview items were based on the students’ self-reported data, and hence it would be better to make any inferences in a conservative manner; moreover, further studies could be needed to examine the effects of concept maps on low- and high-achievers in the two-tier test-based gaming mode. Fourth, the development of such a computer game might be time-consuming, and the content of the educational game might require significant adjustments to apply to other learning activities and subjects. In the meantime, we plan to develop a template of the educational computer game with the proposed approach to be an effective tool to support teaching in the future.

Based on the findings and discussion, the following suggestions are proposed. First, it was noticed that some students would not truly engage in the game; rather, they would accelerate the game process in order to take the test directly, and complete it by repeated guessing. This could be an indication of the immaturity of the game design, and therefore the learning effect of the two-tier test may not be reflected in the learning behavioral pattern. This experiment can only show its advantages with the interview results. It is suggested that different feedback or guidance can be designed in the future to make the test more interactive. Some interviewees mentioned that if questions were associated with defeating monsters (e.g., the monster disappears when an associated question is answered correctly), it would be more intriguing. Furthermore, it is suggested that a greater variety of skill modes in the game plot be developed to enrich the learning task.

Secondly, the CM-TTG mode helped improve student learning achievement, and most learners agreed that such a way of learning was interesting, and the acquired knowledge was highly structured. For future research, it is worth considering combining Csikszentmihalyi's (1975) flow theory and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to further reduce learners' extraneous cognitive load when implementing digital games based on the proposed approach.

Finally, the study aimed to advocate the use of the concept map and two-tier test integrated DGBL, as well as constructing a digital game-based learning system that provides sequential teaching activities and concepts. However, it was observed and indicated from the interviews that the learners did not necessarily follow the game plot as it was designed; that is, students only needed to complete the required tasks and did not necessarily follow a certain procedure. Therefore, students may escape from the game first and then enter the game and keep trying to get the answers, which undermined the learning effectiveness. Johnson and Johnson (1994) noted that collaboration was more beneficial to learning than competitive or individual learning. Additionally, collaborative learning could elicit active learning and strengthen cognitive ability. Therefore, we recommend that a group cooperative learning mechanism could be conducted in the future, where learners can assist, support, and cooperate with each other to improve individual learning effectiveness and achieve the learning goals.
