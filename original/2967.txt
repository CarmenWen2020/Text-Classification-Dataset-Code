Laptop use within college courses has been a topic of debate for nearly two decades. Completely banning laptops from college classes may seem appealing given the potential drawbacks, but these policies may have unintended consequences. One seemingly successful intervention that can address these conflicting goals is the use of laptop zones and laptop-free zones which allows students who want to use their laptops to continue to do so, without hindering the performance of those who do not. We examine the efficacy of this intervention through the lens of the theory of self-regulated learning. We implemented laptop(-free) zones in two large college courses with a total of 168 students, 60 of whom reported sitting in a laptop-zone. Students sitting in the laptop-free zone performed better on objective measures of learning on the day of learning new material, but this difference was not significant five days later on a measure of retention. Further, there were no differences between these groups on self-rated performance at the point of retention. By examining open-ended responses regarding their motivation to sit in the laptop-free zone or the laptop-zone, we found students who sat in the laptop-free zone typically reported wanting to avoid distractions and enhance their memory of the material/class performance compared to those who sat in the laptop zone. Also, more individuals who sat in the laptop zone reported doing so to ensure completeness of their notes, to look up extra course-related material, and to complete non-course related tasks while listening to the lecture. Lastly, we pose a set of future directions aimed at learning more about the use of laptops in and outside of class, and how we can help students be successful using laptops for learning.

1. Introduction
Laptop use within college courses has been a topic of debate for nearly two decades. On the one hand, laptops and other digital technologies provide an opportunity for students to engage with course material in a more interactive way than methods that do not rely upon such technologies (e.g. Dykstra, Tracy, & Wergin, 2013). On the other hand, laptops and other technology can lead to distraction not just for those using the laptop (Aagaard, 2015; Dontre, 2020; Fried, 2008), but for those around them (Hall, Lineweaver, Hogan, & O'Brien, 2020; Sana, Weston, & Cepeda, 2013). Completely banning laptops from college classes may seem appealing given the potential drawbacks (e.g., Yamamoto, 2007), but these policies may have unintended consequences such as reducing attendance (Elliott-Dorans, 2018), making students with technology-related academic accommodations feel embarrassed (Lang, 2016), and potentially fostering a sense of decreased autonomy and control over one's own learning (Hutcheon, Lian, & Richard, 2019).

Therefore, the current study examines whether the implementation of a laptop zone allows students who are not sitting in the laptop zone to immediately learn and retain the class material from lecture better than those who are sitting in a laptop zone, and whether this translates to their perceptions of their own performance. We also seek to explore students’ motivation for sitting in the laptop zone or the laptop-free zone. Further, we examine these phenomena over a relatively short period of time in order to better understand the initial mechanisms by which laptop zones influence learning, in order to supplement and expand upon the higher-level findings of Aguilar-Roca, Williams, and O’Dowd (2012).

1.1. Theoretical underpinnings
To better understand the role laptops play in college classrooms, we draw primarily upon the theory of self-regulated learning (Zimmerman, 2000). This theory proposes a three-phase process by which individuals regulate their behavior and attention to maximize performance or learning. Prior to the act of learning, individuals are in the forethought phase in which they set goals, create plans, and evaluate their interest in the task at hand. During the task they engage in self-control, including attention focusing. Following the task period, individuals engage in self-reflection, evaluating how they did during the performance period from a cognitive and affective perspective. At each of these phases, individual differences and situational characteristics influence the individual's choices. In general, students are not particularly adept at monitoring or evaluating their learning (Bjork, Dunlosky, & Kornell, 2013), however some evidence suggests that students' evaluation of learning is correlated to their reports of on-task behavior during acquisition periods as well as their scores on objective measures of learning, suggesting that at least regarding the impacts of off-task behavior students may be able to recognize its impact on learning (Was, Hollis, & Dunlosky, 2019). In the context of the theory of self-regulated learning (Zimmerman, 2000), this suggests that although students may not have the metacognitive prowess to select the best learning mechanisms for themselves, they are at least able to recognize when their off-task behavior (often associated with laptop use) impacts their learning.

In the context of laptop use during classroom-based learning, this theory offers insight into who chooses to use a laptop, how they use the laptop, and ultimately how well they learn the material. Specifically, individuals who are highly motivated to learn the material, and are aware of the potential distraction will decide to not use laptops during the forethought phase, and may benefit from being physically separated from individuals who do use laptops. During the class itself, laptop users must effortfully focus their attention and ignore the distraction posed by laptops (e.g., Fried, 2008; Sana et al., 2013). This extra effort, or the failure to focus attention on material, ought to harm the learning of material in the short-term. However, following the class, during the self-reflection phase, it is possible that individuals who used their laptops are able to gain awareness of their inadequate understanding of the material, and supplement it with additional exploration of the material through whatever resources they have accessible (e.g., notes, lecture slides, textbook).

1.2. Laptop use and objective performance in classrooms
There is a wealth of data that suggest laptops can hinder learning and performance for a variety of reasons ranging from poorer note quality (Mueller & Oppenheimer, 2014) to distraction (Ravizza, Hambrick, & Fenn, 2014). Although some instructors are willing to implement complete laptop bans in their classrooms (e.g., Yamamoto, 2007), others recognize that laptops can be used in a way that enhances learning through the use of a wide range of instructional tools and activities, and can enhance students' computer literacy (e.g., Efaw, Hampton, Martinez, & Smith, 2004). Even if the instructor fails to capitalize on students' laptop usage in a way that enhances learning, many are still reticent to ban laptops because they do not want to embarrass students who need laptops for academic accommodations (Lang, 2016) or to undermine students' autonomy or perceptions of fairness (e.g., Garcia & Pintrich, 1996; Griffin, 2016). Further, outright technology bans have been associated with decreased student engagement in the course (Hutcheon et al., 2019) and did not improve performance in the course. This aligns with the theory of self-regulated learning (Zimmerman, 2000) in that students would prefer to create their own strategic plans of how to get the most out of the class. By limiting student choice, instructors may be hindering students' strategic plans, and ultimately learning. However, because unregulated laptop usage can harm not only the user's performance and learning, but the learning and performance of those around the user, even if they choose not to use laptops themselves (Fried, 2008; Sana et al., 2013), instructors who do not want to ban laptops are faced with a dilemma: how to allow laptop use without harming the learning of those who choose not to use laptops themselves?

One potential solution is the creation of laptop-zones and laptop-free zones. By physically separating individuals on their laptops from their peers who choose to not use a laptop within the classroom, instructors should, at the very least, be able to ensure that those who choose not to use a laptop are not distracted by those who do. In other words, by creating physical separation between laptop users and non-laptop users, instructors may facilitate learners’ enactment of their strategic plans during the class. By simply preventing individuals from viewing the screens of their peers who are multitasking, instructors may be able to improve the learning outcomes for those who are not on their laptops (Aguilar-Roca et al., 2012; Sana et al., 2013). Further, a laptop-zone policy is generally viewed positively by both laptop-users and non-laptop-users (Aguilar-Roca et al., 2012).

Although a laptop-zone policy does nothing to facilitate the learning of those choosing to use their laptops—unlike interventions such as using active learning activities (e.g., Barak, Lipson, & Lerman, 2006)—it may help prevent laptop misuse from hindering the learning of those who choose to not use laptops. One seemingly successful intervention using this technique by Aguilar-Roca et al. (2012) allowed those who want to use their laptops to continue to do so, without hindering the performance of those who do not. By separating students using laptops from those who do not, educators are able to limit the effects of laptop usage to only those who want to be exposed to laptops. Aguilar-Roca et al. (2012) found that students who used a laptop (regardless of whether they were in a laptop-zoned class or a non-zoned class) performed worse on their midterm and final exams than those who did not use laptops. However, because this study unfolded over the course of a semester, the results may also be capturing motivation or individual differences between individuals who repeatedly chose the laptop zones versus those who repeatedly chose the laptop-free zones. Further, it is impossible to determine any short-term learning effects from these longer-term data, which is a necessary step to better understand the role that self-regulation of attention plays during class and in the days/weeks after new material is introduced. For example, it is unclear in the results of Aguilar-Roca et al. (2012) whether it was the case that during the class period no students learned the material, but students who are not on their laptops had more organized or personally relevant notes or stronger motivation to learn the material in time for their exams compared to individuals who use laptops. Further, it may be the case that students feel as though they are learning the material while they are on their laptops even though when they are tested across all content they have learned in the class, their recall is clearly worse than laptop-free users.

The theory of self-regulated learning would suggest that many students who choose to not use laptops in class may do so because they are particularly motivated to learn the material and aware of the distraction laptops pose. Further, the theory of self-regulated learning would argue that exposure to distraction during the learning task requires increased effort to focus attention on learning in the moment. This is supported by the many studies that examine laptop use that find distraction and multitasking are a primary detriment of laptop use (e.g., Flanigan & Babchuk, 2020; Fried, 2008; Hembrooke & Gay, 2003; Kraushaar & Novak, 2010; Ravizza et al., 2014; Sana et al., 2013). Given the deleterious effects of distraction and task-unrelated-thoughts (Bloom, 1953) on immediate processing (Brisson & Jolicœur, 2007; Rau, Zheng, & Wei, 2020), learning (Hembrooke & Gay, 2003; Kuznekoff, Munz, & Titsworth, 2015; Kuznekoff & Titsworth, 2013) and retention (Hollis & Was, 2016), we argue that in the moment, students who are in a laptop-free zone learn newly presented material better than their peers in a laptop-zone. Therefore, we hypothesize:

(1)
Students who sit in the laptop-free zone will perform better on a test of immediate retention of information presented in the same class session than those who sit in a laptop zone.

The theory of self-regulated learning (Zimmerman, 2000), however, would point toward the reflection phase as an opportunity for students to determine whether further interaction with the material is necessary for adequate learning. On the one hand, students who experienced heightened levels of distraction during the learning phase due to laptop usage ought to feel more focused interaction with the material is necessary to adequately learn it. On the other hand, students who did not use laptops may be more keenly aware of potential challenges with the material that need further exploration. We argue that knowledge monitoring—the process of understanding what one knows and does not yet know, and a form of metacognition that is critical to success in education (e.g., Everson & Tobias, 1998)—plays a key role in the decision to further interact with the material. Individuals who have stronger knowledge monitoring abilities may be more acutely aware of the negative effects of laptop use on their own learning and thus choose to not use them, and these same students may be more acutely aware for the need to continue interacting with the material to learn it. Therefore, we hypothesize:

(2)
Students who sit in the laptop-free zone will perform better on a follow-up test of information presented in the previous class session than those who sit in a laptop zone.

1.3. Laptop use and subjective performance in classrooms
The theory of self-regulated learning (Zimmerman, 2000) suggests that following a learning performance episode, individuals evaluate their experience and adjust future plans accordingly. Although most students recognize the potential for distraction and off-task behaviors when using a laptop in class (Aagaard, 2015; Baker, Lusk, & Neuhauser, 2012) and that this can hinder their own learning (Sana et al., 2013), many students still choose to use laptops in class for a variety of reasons (Aguilar-Roca et al., 2012). The theory of self-regulated learning would suggest that individuals who choose to use laptops in class evaluate their experience positively, despite any objective decrements in performance, given that it adhered to their strategic plan and expectations set during the forethought phase (Zimmerman, 2000). However, students, on average, tend to understand the potential distraction that laptops pose, and that this distraction can hinder their own learning (e.g., Sana et al., 2013). In this way, it is theoretically clear that despite reporting poorer levels of learning, laptop use continues because it was successful execution of a strategic plan. Thus, despite adhering to their strategic plans set during the forethought phase, students who use laptops in the classroom may evaluate their learning more poorly during the reflection phase compared to students who do not use laptops. Thus, we hypothesize:

(3)
Students who sit in the laptop-free zone will perceive higher levels of performance on a follow-up test of recently learned information than those who sit in a laptop zone.

1.4. Motivations for using laptops
Lastly, we want to explore students’ motivations for sitting in the laptop zone or the laptop-free zone. In their assessment of a laptop-free zone, Aguilar-Roca et al. (2012) examined reasons students provided for taking notes on a laptop or on paper. They coded these responses as either easy/convenient, facilitates learning, or other. Results suggested that individuals who took notes on a laptop did so for convenience more so than those who took notes via paper, while those who took notes via paper did so for enhanced learning more so than those who took notes via laptop. However, these data faced several limitations. First, only 25 students who took notes via laptop provided their reasoning, compared to the 273 students who took notes by hand that provided a response. Second, the potential reasons for using a laptop or taking notes by hand that were coded by Aguilar-Roca et al. (2012) did not explicitly include desire to multitask or avoid distraction, two of the main concerns regarding laptop usage in classes.

We argue that students’ motivations to (not) use a laptop within the classroom are reflective of their own metacognitive processes and strategic plan formation during the forethought phase of self-regulated learning theory (Zimmerman, 2000). It may not be the case that knowledge of the potential distraction laptops pose is enough of a reason for individuals to choose to sit in the laptop-free zone. It may be that individuals who want to avoid distractions choose to sit in the laptop-free zone, but that students who view off-task behavior as breaks (i.e., internally-driven sequential multitasking; Fletcher, Telford, Potter, 2018) rather than a distraction (i.e., externally-driven concurrent form of task sequencing; Fletcher, Potter, & Telford, 2018) choose to sit in the laptop-zone. Further, it may be the case that individuals choose to use laptops in the way that instructors would prefer, providing a useful supplement to the lecture by accessing relevant online material (e.g., Hembrooke & Gay, 2003).

The use of laptops may also be motivated by an anxiety regarding the completeness of notes, whereas individuals who take notes by hand are motivated more by a desire to learn or remember the material. Data suggest that for factual information, learning and memory is not necessarily affected by whether individuals take notes via laptop or by hand (e.g., Urry et al., 2020), but for more challenging conceptual material, handwritten notes were more effective (Mueller & Oppenheimer, 2014). Certainly, individuals who take notes via laptops are able to write more and can take notes in a verbatim manner (Mueller & Oppenheimer, 2014), which may be driven by debilitative achievement anxiety (Carrier, Higson, Klimonski, & Peterson, 1984). Regardless, we argue that the theory of self-regulated learning (Zimmerman, 2000) suggests individuals create a strategic plan regarding how they will learn, based on their motivation and understanding of the context. In doing so, laptop usage in class may simply reflect different (albeit potentially less beneficial) strategic plans. Thus, we explore the following research questions:

(RQ1) Why do students sit in the laptop-free zone?

(RQ2) Why do students sit in the laptop zone?

2. Method
2.1. Participants
Participants (Mage = 19.28, SDage = 1.48) in the study were 168 undergraduate students enrolled in either an introduction to psychology course (n = 97) or a personality psychology course (n = 71) at a large public STEM-oriented university in the Southeastern United States. Ninety students (nIntro = 55, npersonality = 35) across the two classes reported sitting in the laptop-free zone and 60 students (nIntro = 36, npersonality = 24) reported sitting in the laptop zone, and eighteen did not report the zone in which they sat.

2.2. Procedure
On the first day of the course, and in the syllabus, students were informed of a laptop zone consisting of the four, rightmost seats in each row of the lecture hall. If students were to use a laptop, they had to sit in this zone. If they were unable to find a seat in this zone, they were not able to use their laptop. If students attempted to use a laptop outside of this zone, the professor stopped class, and told the student to turn off their laptop or move to the laptop zone (a rare occurrence).

In the middle of the semester, students were given a quiz at the end of class for three consecutive class periods (Tuesday (Time 0), Thursday (Time 1), Tuesday (Time 2); See Fig. 1 for study flow). The quiz was identical at all three time points. Students were given credit for participating in the quiz, but were not told that their scores did not count toward their grade until after they had completed the final quiz. The students were also not told ahead of time that they would be quizzed at any of these time points. The quiz covered a topic the students learned at Time 1 (cognition in introduction to psychology course, and personality genetics in personality course). Therefore, scores on Time 0 serve as pre-test to ensure there were no group differences between laptop and laptop-free zone groups on knowledge of the material, and to allow for an estimation of immediate learning of the material from the lecture provided at T1. The score at T1 then serves as a measure of immediate learning/recall, and the score at T2 serves as a measure of short-term learning/retention.

Students responded to the survey items after completing the quiz at Time 1, except for the question about subjective performance which was collected after the third test (T2). Students were given the following instructions “Please answer the following questions honestly, they help me design future classes. They hold no bearing on your course or assignment grades or how you are viewed by me or the TAs.”

2.3. Measures
2.3.1. Objective measure of learning
Participants were given either a 19- or 14-item quiz (Appendix A) depending on whether they were in the Introduction to Psychology or Personality Theories course, respectively. This quiz covered a topic the students would learn at Time 1 (thinking or genetics, respectively), and contained items generated by the instructor based explicitly on content that would be covered at Time 1. Scores are the mean proportion correct, thus could range from 0 to 1, 0 representing all incorrect, and 1 representing all correct. Quiz items were the same (within class) across iterations to ensure changes in scores could be attributed to learning the material, not changes in the test itself. This allows for a more accurate estimation of a growth curve which indicates learning and retention. Further, students were not provided feedback on their quizzes, nor were questions or results discussed until after the study had completed in order to reduce any potential repeated testing effects.

The intraclass coefficient (ICC) associated with the class was 0.22 suggesting that 22% of the variance in test scores is accounted for by which class students were in, while the ICC associated with the person level was 0.10, suggesting 10% of the variance in test scores occurred at the person level, the remainder of variance is accounted for by which time point the quiz was administered.

2.3.2. Subjective measure of learning
At Time 2, participants were asked to respond to the prompt “How well do you think you performed on this quiz?” on a five-point scale (1 = worse than nearly all of my peers, 2 = worse than most of my peers, 3 = about average, 4 = better than most of my peers, 5 = better than nearly all of my peers). This was only administered at Time 2 for two reasons, first to avoid altering students’ reflections of their learning as reflection plays a key role in the mechanisms of the theory of self-regulated learning, and second to minimize the amount of time students were responding to survey material during any one class.

2.3.3. Motivational measure of zone selection
Participants were asked to respond to the following prompt “Please write a sentence or two about why you chose to sit in the laptop zone or not.”

2.3.4. Laptop zone
Students were asked to report whether they sat in the laptop zone at Time 1 (the day of learning the novel material; 0 = No, 1 = Yes). This was highly correlated with reported use of a laptop on the day of learning (laptop today) the novel material (r = .90, t(148) < 0.001).

2.3.5. Control variables
Participants also reported which row they sat in (1 = row closest to front, 12 = row furthest from the front), whether they took notes (0 = no, 1 = yes), and whether they used their cellphones (1 = not at all, 2 = some (once or twice), 3 = moderately (a few times), 4 = often (many times, long periods), 5 = a lot (almost exclusively on your phone)).

3. Results
Means, standard deviations, and intercorrelations are presented in Table 1. Scores on the quiz are visually represented in Fig. 2.

3.1. Laptop zone and objective performance results
To test our hypotheses about objective performance, we fitted a linear mixed-effects model using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) using the lavaan package in R (Rosseel, 2012). Given the nested nature of the data, our model had three levels: time (Level 1), nested within student (Level 2), nested within class (Level 3). Results (see Table 2) suggest that individuals who sat in the laptop zone performed significantly worse on the day of learning the material (γ = −0.07, p = .02). This supports Hypothesis 1, which stated students who sat in the laptop-free zone would perform better on a test of immediate retention of information presented in the same class session than those who sat in a laptop zone. Results (γ = −0.05, p = .07) also show that there was no difference in performance between those who sat in the laptop zone and those that sat in the laptop-free zone in objective performance at T2 (five days after T1), thus failing to support Hypothesis 2 which stated students who sat in the laptop-free zone would perform better on a follow-up test of information presented in the previous class session than those who sat in a laptop zone. It should be noted, however, that this effect was in the expected direction. Further, these relationships hold even after controlling for cellphone usage, which row students sat in, and whether they reported taking notes. Together, these results suggest that students who sat in the laptop zone did perform worse on tests of immediate recall (Time 1) but not necessarily delayed recall (Time 2), supporting Hypothesis 1 but not Hypothesis 2.

3.2. Laptops zone and subjective performance results
To test Hypothesis 3, which stated students who sat in the laptop-free zone would perceive higher levels of performance on a follow-up test of recently learned information than those who sat in a laptop zone, we fitted a linear mixed-effects model using REML, but since there was only one time point at which students rated their subjective performance, this model only had two levels (Level 1: Person, Level 2: Class). Results (Table 3) suggest that students who sat in the laptop zone did not perceive their performance on the test at T2 as significantly worse than those who sat in the laptop-free zone (γ = −0.14, p = .21). This held even after controlling for cellphone usage, which row students sat in, and whether they took notes. Thus, Hypothesis 3 was not supported.

3.3. Motivations regarding zone selection
To explore our research question regarding the reasons students gave for sitting in the laptop zone or not, the first author coded responses to the open ended question “Please write a sentence or two about why you chose to sit in the laptop zone or not” for five themes: to reduce distraction/pay attention, to improve memory/performance, to improve note quality/completeness, to look up outside material to enhance notes/understanding, and to multitask on non-course related things. These categories reflect patterns of self-reported use found in Aguilar-Roca et al., 2012, and Kay & Lauricella, 2011. Participants’ responses were not restricted to only one theme, meaning they could be coded as relating to multiple themes. For example, “I like to handwrite notes because it helps me pay attention and remember what was taught” was coded as both reducing distraction and improving memory/performance. Additionally, not all responses (n = 18) contained content related to one of the five themes (e.g., “My laptop does not work very well.“), thus they did not contribute to totals for any of the pre-determined themes. Examples of relevant statements are presented in Table 4.


Table 4. Representative sample of qualitative responses.

Laptop Zone	Laptop-free Zone
Distraction-Self	–	I knew I would be too tempted to go and complete other tasks instead of paying attention
I don't like typing my notes because I don't think I pay as much attention when I type as I do when I write
Distraction-Others	I always sit in the laptop section because typing is easier/faster for me than writing notes and helps me focus on what the professor is saying in class rather than being occupied handwriting notes.
I prefer to play solitaire while listening to lecture because I can still listen to the lecture without getting restless	I don't want to get distracted by other people
I feel that if I sit in the laptop section I will be distracted by other things happening on people's computers
I don't use my laptop to take notes, and I often find it distracting to be around people who are, as they often surf the web
Memory	I like having the option to look things up online without feeling disruptive-it helps me learn/reference other notes that I have saved on Quizlet	Handwriting notes keeps my attention focused and retain the info better
I usually learn better from handwriting notes
I like handwritten notes because it forces me to engage with the material more
You said that people perform better statistically if they take handwritten notes instead of typing them
Completeness	While I like handwriting notes better, I've noticed that in note-heavy classes it's more difficult to keep them organized so I take notes on my laptop instead
I use my laptop to take notes because you can always add to typed notes/change them but if handwritten notes are messy you can't keep up with the lecture speed you can't fix it
If I need to go back to a slide I missed part of I can pull it up on Canvas.
I think taking notes is faster than handwriting so that way I don't miss a lot of the information when I type them	Very slow typer
Outside Material	I like the option of looking at the powerpoints and just having the option to have my laptop out in case I need to write something down or look something up I use my laptop to take notes on Google Docs. Also, can look up definitions if unfamiliar
I sit in the laptop section so I can quickly reference sources on info presented in class to get more information knowledge or examples
There are too many terms in this class. As a non-native English speaker, computers can help me translate them and make it understandable	–
Multitask	It gives me the choice and option to use my laptop to search concepts from class for notes and multitask
To be brutally honest, I have a large project due tonight and I wanted to work on it a bit during lecture today-not a good idea, I know
I like to do the TLAS and essay responses [course assignments] in class
I wanted to sign up for a tutoring position today	I don't like to multitask with my computer during a lecture
More students who sat in the laptop-free zone (n = 42) reported wanting to avoid distractions compared to those who sat in the laptop zone (n = 3). Similarly, significantly more students who sat in the laptop-free zone (n = 20) reported doing so to enhance their memory of the material or performance in the class than those who sat in the laptop zone (n = 1). These open-ended responses suggest that those who choose not to sit in the laptop section do so primarily to enhance their memory, attention, and performance in the class.

On the other hand, more individuals who sat in the laptop zone (n = 22) reported doing so to ensure completeness of their notes than those who sat in the laptop-free zone (n = 3). Similarly, more individuals who sat in the laptop zone (n = 13) reported doing so to look up extra course-related material compared to those who sat in the laptop-free zone (n = 0). However, more individuals who sat in the laptop zone (n = 17) reported doing so to complete non-course related tasks while listening to the lecture compared to those who sat in the laptop-free zone (n = 2). These data support the notion that students who choose to sit in the laptop section do so both to enhance their perceived note quality by ensuring completeness and looking up external material, but also to multitask on non-course related work.

3.3. Post-hoc open-ended response analyses
Given the unique nature of the laptop-free zone which was designed to allow students to choose to not distract themselves with their own laptop, but also to be free of distractions of other laptops, we wanted to determine which, if either, was a more commonly reported reason for not sitting in the laptop zone. The first author coded the responses of those who reported sitting in the laptop-free zone to avoid distractions for whether these distractions originated from one's own laptop usage or the usage of laptops around them. Participants were coded as avoiding distractions from others if they explicitly mentioned it or mentioned not wanting to be distracted by laptops, plural, rather than laptop singular. If they did not mention others or plural distractions, they were coded as avoiding distractions from their own computers. Fifteen students reported wanting to avoid the distraction of others' laptops, while 25 did not. This suggests that one's own laptop may be the most salient source of distraction that students wish to avoid.

4. Discussion
The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a laptop zone intervention on subjective and objective differences in performance, as well as to understand what motivates students to choose to sit in the laptop zone or not. Results suggest students who sat within the laptop zone performed worse on a quiz that tested whether students could recall the information taught that day. However, students did not differ on their objective performance five days after the material was presented nor did they differ on their subjective ratings of their performance based on the zone in which they sat. Examining students’ reported reasons for choosing the laptop zone or not, those that chose to in the laptop-free zone did so to avoid distraction and enhance their memory of the material, while those that sat within the laptop zone did so to ensure the completeness of their notes, access outside material to enhance their learning, but also to multitask on non-course related activities.

Certainly, there are benefits to students having regular access to their laptops during lectures (i.e., look up outside material), but this clearly comes at a cost of decreased learning of new material during class time. By allowing students to choose to sit in a laptop zone or not, faculty allow students to set their own strategic plans about whether to risk their own distraction to enhance their learning for themselves. Our results clearly suggest that, with regard to immediate learning, a laptop zone is not a successful academic intervention for those who sit in that zone. However, scores on the objective and subjective measures of learning five days after the presentation of new material showed no difference. The theory of self-regulated learning would suggest that these findings may be due to a discrepancy between the students' strategic plans, their failure to adhere to them, and then self-reflection and altered behavior to make up for this discrepancy. Findings suggest that students’ behaviors outside of class play a key role in their learning, particularly if they used a laptop during class.

One reason why it is important to understand students’ strategic plans is because of our initial finding: those in laptop zones do worse after immediately learning material. Research in industrial-organizational psychology (Bangert-Drowns, Kulik, Kulik, & Morgan, 1991; Fletcher, French, Kidwell, & Burnett, 2020, Sotola & Credé, 2020) and cognitive neuroscience (Karpicke & Blunt, 2011; van den Broek et al., 2016) suggest that students benefit from frequent small-stakes testing. Students do not have optimal metacognitive awareness regarding their learning and learning strategies (Bjork et al., 2013; Was et al., 2019), so building in opportunities to assess frequently may help facilitate their engagement and learning, and trigger periods of reflection upon the quality and implementation of their strategic plans.

4.1. Limitations
As this study is rooted in an intervention, it faces certain limitations. First, there is no comparison group in which students were freely able to use laptops anywhere in the classroom. In doing so, we would have been able to compare the performance of students who did not use a laptop in both class settings. The literature, however, has found that being able to see another student's laptop is distracting and harms performance (e.g., Aguilar-Roca et al., 2012) and as such, we would expect to find worsened performance for those who did not use laptops in the unstructured class compared to those who did not use laptops in the class with a laptop zone.

Second, we did not randomly assign students to the laptop zone, so we cannot be sure that it is the laptop zone, rather than individual differences that drive the phenomena we are seeing. Yet, by allowing students to select their own zone we captured the efficacy of the intervention in a high-fidelity way, that allows students to enact their strategic plan regarding their learning processes, something that would not occur with random assignment. If we were to randomly assign individuals to a laptop-zone or a laptop-free zone, we would have been unable to test the utility of the intervention in a real-world scenario, and would essentially render the forethought phase of the theory of self-regulated learning (Zimmerman, 2000) untestable. Further, data were collected from intact classes taught by the same instructor, which may suggest that findings are driven by unmeasured variables (e.g., instructor charisma, nature of the material, qualities of the students). Thus, because we have a non-probability sample, the causal conclusions of this study are limited.

Also, regarding the open-ended responses, it should be noted that the instructions may have limited the number of reasons students provided by students regarding their selection of zone. Because the instructions asked for “a sentence or two” it may be possible students did not provide all of the reasons that played into their decisions, and as such our qualitative analyses should be seen as supportive of our findings, but not an exhaustive examination of possible motivations.

4.2. Future directions
The narrow focus of this study to explore the impacts of a laptop-zone and laptop-free zone does not allow for us to make recommendations regarding how to best use laptops in the classroom. Our results do show immediate differences in learning between laptop users and laptop-free users that may dissipate over a few days. However, the results of Aguilar-Roca et al. (2012) suggest that these differences may persists when aggregated across content and over the course of the semester. We argue that students inside the laptop zone may immediately perform poorly because they are not receiving any guidance on how to use the laptop successfully during class, but they may have formulated their own strategic plans to account for this outside of class. It may be that students who choose to be in laptop zones will do well in later semester assessments due to successful strategic plans compared to immediate assessments, but that this requires a greater time commitment outside of the class. This increased time commitment may account for the differences in findings between our study and Aguilar-Roca et al.’s (2012), in that in the short-term (e.g., five days) outside of class studying is not overly burdensome, but when considering the totality of a course's material, students who do not learn immediately due to sitting in a laptop section, face insurmountable challenge of required studying. One goal for future research is to focus on the between-class behaviors to paint a more holistic picture of the success of laptop zones. This is a rich area for future research because once we know more about the between-class behaviors, instructors can help students develop successful strategic plans for.

It is also necessary for future studies to continue exploring how the best ensure students, particularly those who use laptops for academic accommodations, can be best equipped to learn material as it is presented in class, so as to perform as well as their peers who are not using laptops. As previously mentioned, the impact of frequent low-stakes testing on students’ strategic plans, self-reflection, and ultimate performance may be explored.

This study focuses on the use of laptops during in-person courses. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic there was an increase of online learning (e.g., Seaman, Allen, & Seaman, 2018), and following restrictions of large gatherings, much of higher education took place online (e.g., Rashid & Yadav, 2020). Although the future of the in-person versus online format for higher education is uncertain, our results can only inform in-person courses. Certainly, there are motivational factors influencing whether students preferred to use their laptops during an in-person class, and it may be the case that those who preferred not to would not fare as well in an online course as those students who preferred laptop zones, but significant future research is necessary to explore this possibility.

4.3. Practical implications
Our study suggests that, indeed, objective performance is higher if students do not sit in the laptop zone. Yet, we argue that students and scholars have found value in allowing laptop use during lectures (i.e., look up outside material, a disability accommodation). Further, college students should be treated with respect and given autonomy over their own education. Our results suggest that the use of a laptop zone allows students to choose their own experience of the course, without distracting those that would rather be able to fully pay attention in the class.

As such, faculty should consider implementing a laptop zone within a minority of seats in their classrooms (ensuring equal distribution across rows from front to back). This intervention, however, should be accompanied by a conversation regarding the potential drawbacks of laptop use, particularly if it is for multitasking. Faculty may also consider reserving this intervention for their more advanced courses, when students may have developed the metacognitive ability to gauge their own performance, while using a more rigid policy for lower-level classes. Moving forward, our results suggest instructors have a twofold responsibility: (1) instructors need to reflect and think about activities and methods for successful laptop use in their class, and (2) instructors ought to work closely with students to develop a successful strategic plan for successful in-class learning. For example, perhaps providing students with scaffolding course notes would help students stay on task and use their laptops successfully.

Our data suggest that although students did have worse performance if they sat in the laptop zone, they were not aware of their decreased performance, suggesting they may need more immediate feedback on their performance so as to make better individualized judgements about how to spend their time in class. However, a number of individuals were actively using their laptops to do non-class related tasks. It may be the case that these students either feel that they are able to learn the material while multitasking, an assumption that has been refuted by a wealth of empirical data (Brisson & Jolicœur, 2007; Hembrooke & Gay, 2003; Hollis & Was, 2016; Kuznekoff et al., 2015; Kuznekoff & Titsworth, 2013; Rau et al., 2020), or that they are making a judgement about their time, valuing other tasks above learning the material within the course. Regardless of their reasoning, it is apparent that at least some students who are able to use laptops in class will multitask. Rather than letting students use laptops to multitask anywhere in the classroom, at least by isolating them in a laptop zone, faculty can allow those students to multitask without distracting other students who want to fully focus on course content.

5. Conclusion
As laptops and other internet-enabled devices become more ubiquitous it is important for educators to find ways to allow students to use technology to enhance their education without harming the education of their peers. Our study examined the efficacy of a laptop zone within two separate lecture-based college psychology courses. Results suggest that students who sat within the laptop zone did perform worse on a quiz testing their knowledge about newly covered material. However, this decrement dissipated by a follow-up test of retention five days later, which was mirrored in students’ reports of how they felt they performed which were similar across the laptop and laptop-free zones. Open-ended responses suggest that students who chose to sit within the laptop zone did so in order to multitask, to enhance their notes with outside materials, or to ensure completeness of their notes. Students who chose not to sit in the laptop zone did so to avoid distractions (both of their own laptop use as well as that of others), and to enhance their memory of the material. We suggest that educators consider implementing a laptop zone to allow students autonomy over their education without distracting their peers.
