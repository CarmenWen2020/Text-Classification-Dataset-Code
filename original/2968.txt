This paper aims to provide research-based evidence for highlighting the paradigm shifts of e-book research. The most popular e-book-related keywords (e.g., electronic book, e-book) were used to retrieve the most relevant and quality journal articles published in the recent decade (2010–2109) from the Web of Science. Unlike most e-book review studies based on content analysis, this present paper employed a co-citation network analysis to examine the bibliographic relationships for the development of e-book-supported learning research. While the co-citation analysis is to identify the most highly joint-referenced e-book articles, social network analysis is to visualize the e-book co-citation networks with the main characteristics of the research interest (e.g., the focused research subjects and variables that measured learning outcomes). After careful screening and reviewing of the search data, a total of 55 high-quality e-book articles with 1203 citations were collected and analyzed. The result of the e-book research networks across two periods provided a decade overview of the development of e-book-supported learning research. (1) Early research (2010–2014) focused on improving the emerging literacy of preschool children and the learning effects of e-books. A sub-stream of high-risk students' e-book use was also identified. (2) In recent years (2015–2019), e-books were used at various education levels and were adopted in more diverse learning contexts. For young children's e-book use, researchers focused on e-book reading for early literacy, especially in the situation of co-reading with an adult. For university students, researchers focused on developing e-book-based systems to achieve better results and reduce their anxiety during formal learning. Discussion and implications are provided.

1. Introduction
The emergence of computer-based electronic books (i.e., digital versions of books), often known as “e-books,” has provided users with an efficient and effective tool for learning and teaching purposes. The e-book-related research has also attracted researchers’ attention in the past decades. According to the Web of Science (WoS), the publication trend of e-book research has gradually increased in recent decades. Researchers have reported that the international journal publication trends of e-book research have risen from 142 to 438 articles, and the non-repeated authorship of the articles has grown from 247 to 948 authors in the past two decades (2000–2019) (Tang, Hsiao, & Su, 2020). It has also been found that many e-book studies were published in diversified research categories (defined by the WoS), such as information, library science, computer science and information systems, business, and education and educational research.

Focused on educational use, researchers have found that some parents and educators used e-books as the teaching tools to develop young children's learning strategies (Connor et al., 2019) and emergent literacy (Korat & Segal-Drori, 2016). Researchers have also suggested that some advantages of e-books are flexible, interactive, and accessible over paper-based books (Korat, Levin, Atishkin, & Turgeman, 2014). For example, e-books that include a built-in dictionary allow children to learn the meanings of new words and to develop a rich vocabulary. It is considered as important infrastructure for improving reading accuracy (Korat, Levin, Atishkin, & Turgeman, 2014). In addition to young students, researchers have found that functional e-books with annotation and sharing functions can promote tertiary level students' learning performance (Lim & Hew, 2014). In the context of higher education in Turkey, Turel and Sanal (2018) suggested that the use of motivational designed e-book can be used to improve undergraduate students' learning achievement and anxiety. Recently, Zarzour and colleagues conducted empirical research to investigate the use of Facebook-based e-books for learning (Zarzour, Bendjaballah, & Harirche, 2020). Based on a comparison of the experimental group and the control group, the results revealed some significant differences in learners' behavioral patterns, including the relationship of lower and higher engagement and learning outcomes. Overall, previous e-book studies in the education area have indicated some research foci in the field of e-book-supported learning, including learning outcomes (e.g., emergent literacy, learning achievement), learners' behavioral patterns (e.g., motivation), and some pedagogical effects for teachers.

1.1. Related reviews on the e-book research
As for the viewpoint of understanding the development of the e-book literature, the fruitful results of these published studies have provided a good foundation for conducting further review analysis of e-book research. According to the WoS, the past review studies mainly focused on the narrative, general survey, and meta-analysis of e-book research. For example, Kumbhar (2012) conducted a narrative review to analyze e-book publications. Selected articles were from various databases including Emerald, Science Direct, and non-English sources published in the single year of 2010. Kumbhar (2012) concluded that there are three main reasons why people adopt e-books, namely their user-friendliness, cost, and portability. On the other hand, copyright and digital rights management are challenging issues for e-book adoption. Moyer (2012) provided another narrative review of audiobooks and e-books. Various types of literature from library and information science (LIS), education, and others were included, such as peer-reviewed articles, theses, industrial reports, and blog posts. The review compared LIS research prior to 2006, education and other research pre–2006, and research published from 2006 to 2010. Based on the results, the author provided some research directions and puts forward some practical suggestions, including new types of collections involving various e-books, e-book readers, and related library services. Focused on scholarly articles, Girard (2014) conducted a systematic review of the barriers to the adoption of e-books. Based on a review of 53 published journal articles, the author identified some obstacles that students encountered when adopting e-books, including physical (both software and hardware), cognitive, social, and cultural barriers.

Swanson, Austin, Stewart, and Scammacca (2020), on the other hand, used a meta-analysis to systematically examine the impact of e-book use on student literacy outcomes. Although there is a lack of statistical evidence to support the differences in reading comprehension between e-book reading and non-e-book reading, they suggested that e-books can replace traditional printed books to support students' reading comprehension development. Recently, Furenes, Kucirkov, & Bus (2021) compared children's learning outcomes when reading paper-based storybooks and digital storybooks. Based on the analysis of 1812 samples from 39 studies, the results showed that the comprehension scores of children in the e-book group were lower than those in the paper book group; however, digital books performed better than paper books in terms of enhanced story consistency. On the other hand, adult intervention is more effective when reading paper books than when children reading e-books alone. Furenes, Kucirkova, and Bus (2021) concluded that adults' supports are critical for children's learning performance when using digital books. They also used cognitive load theory to explain how children can read storybooks on digital devices by themselves. While the general review provided a narrative overview of the research development and future trends based on the experts' opinions, meta-analysis was used to examine relationships between research constructs and to estimate their effect sizes based on the empirical data of published studies.

1.2. Research objectives and contributions of this study
This paper aims to provide citation-based evidence to reveal the research patterns in the use of e-books for learning purposes in the last decade (2010–2019). Some bibliometricians have suggested that citation-based analysis can provide solid evidence to review the trends in the literature, as the pool of citations represent the “field's view” of itself (White & Griffith, 1981). However, few education researchers have conducted a bibliographic analysis to review e-book development and identify the mainstreams. Borgman and Furner (2002) suggested that bibliographic analysis is a helpful tool for researchers to conduct reviews as it provides some indices and descriptive statistics (e.g., h-index, citation counts) to profile the publication structure and to shed light on future research directions. Co-citation analysis is a well-established analytic method and has been adopted to analyze the intellectual structure of various themes in the education domain in recent years, such as higher education (Smith & Brown, 2020), nurse education (Chang, Gau, Tang, & Hwang, 2020), language learning (Lim & Aryadoust, 2021), telecollaboration and AI-enhanced online learning (Barbosa & Ferreira-Lopes, 2021; Tang, Chang, & Hwang, 2021).

Recently, researchers have used bibliometric analysis to analyze the e-book literature. For example, Kolle, Shettar, Kumar, and Parameshwar (2018) analyzed a total of 2965 documents in the Scopus database according to the following categories: document types, publication output, citations, journals, productive countries, and the most frequently appearing words/phrases from the titles of the articles. The results show that the United States and the United Kingdom were the most productive countries, and Korat was the most productive e-book researcher. Chen, Hwang, Majumdar, Toyokawa, and Ogata (2021) conducted a literature analysis of the use of e-books for language learning from 2011 to 2020. They analyzed the journal articles’ author-defined keywords and concluded that reading comprehension was the most researched keyword in the first period (2011–2015). The result also showed that learning engagement was the top-used keyword (2016–2020).

These findings of the above literature analyses have provided bibliometric evidence of publication patterns in e-book research, including the most cited articles, journals, country productivity, and the most used keywords in the field. However, a visualized network combining the most referenced e-book research has not yet been researched. Following the above-mentioned bibliometric analyses in the education area, a co-citation network analysis to reveal the intellectual structure of e-book research is needed. A co-citation is defined as two published articles that jointly cite some earlier publications as their references (Small, 1973). In this sense, the frequency of co-citations can be considered as more rigorous evidence of the research streams, since most follow-up studies frequently cite some core articles together. Based on the co-citation network analysis, the e-book research patterns were investigated with the following objectives: (1) To identify the e-book research that has been highly cross-referenced as the core papers in each period (period I: 2010–2014; period II: 2015–2019). This is to provide the citation-based evidence as the foundation for further visualization of e-book research patterns in network form. (2) To profile the networking relationships and the main attributes (including research subjects, variables, contexts, methods, and learning tools) of e-book core papers in each research network. The analyzed variables in this study included focal variables and grouping variables. While focal variables in e-book research were related to learning performance, motivation, and emergent literacy, grouping variables were used to separate participants into control and experimental groups, which is often found in experimental studies. This is to provide research-based evidence of how e-books support learning across two research periods. (3) To compare the e-book development and to analyze the follow-up studies of highly co-cited e-book articles to provide future directions.

2. Method
To systematically profile the intellectual structure of e-book research published in the recent decade, a series of processes was used. First, the research data were searched, screened, and collected. After the data collection was completed, the document co-citation analysis and social network analysis were then used to explore the e-book research development, comparing the recent 10 years. The detailed networking relationships of all e-book articles in the two periods of interest (period I: 2010–2014; period II: 2015–2019) were visualized as the social diagrams of research. The setting of two research periods was to balance the years of analyzed publications as has been adopted in some past review studies (Chen et al., 2021; Lin, Lin, Potvin, & Tsai, 2019; Tang et al., 2020). The comparison of the two periods of research could reveal some potential changes in research focus in the e-book area. The period of research interest covers the most recent years from 2010 to 2019, providing researchers with the cutting-edge directions of e-book research.

2.1. Search of e-book research articles
To observe the potential changes in e-book research streams, we focused on high-quality journal articles in the field. The bibliographic data of research articles used for this study were searched from the renowned database of the WoS. The core collection of the WoS covers the most important and top-tier education journals, and is used as the sourcing foundation. To include the most related e-book research in the analysis, the general terminology of e-books with different forms including electronic book(s), e-book(s), and digital book(s), was used as the keywords to search for as many e-book-related research articles in the WoS as possible. However, with the aim of an educational focus, the search scope was limited to the category of “education and educational research” (a WoS-defined research category) which includes the most high-quality education journals in the field. As a result, the search returned 161 candidate articles. The search of e-book-related articles was conducted on June 7, 2020.

2.2. Initial screening of the research data
The screening process was conducted to filter out two kinds of research data, that is, the documents irrelevant to the research interest and the documents not yet accredited (without a citation). The first step was to prevent the inclusion of potentially irrelevant papers using KeywordPlus in the topics searched for in the WoS, by conducting a further screening process of the research data.As such, 59 irrelevant articles and two articles with incomplete records were removed, leaving 100 for further analysis.

The second step was to establish the citation relationships of the remaining articles. After careful screening, the citation data of the 100 articles were then retrieved from the WoS (the search was conducted on June 7, 2020). In this step, we dropped 21 articles that had not yet been cited at the time of the search. Since we aimed to explore the intellectual structure of e-book research based on citation-based evidence, those papers without citation data could not be further analyzed and so were removed (16 papers published between 2003 and 2012 showed less impact, while the other five papers were published after 2015). To maintain the consistent quality of the citation research, only citations from other journal articles were counted (book chapters and conference preceding papers were excluded), providing high-quality citation-based evidence to analyze the main streams of e-book research. For example, the research conducted by Woody, Daniel, and Baker (2010) was recorded as being cited 220 times (which is as shown in the “TC” column of the WoS). Among 220 citations, we collected 166 records which were accredited by other published journal articles. All of the 79 e-book articles which received a total of 1203 citations were then downloaded from the WoS article by article, and a list of citation relationships (cited-citing articles) was established. The collection procedure of the bibliographic data was carried out over a period of four days and was completed on June 10, 2020.

2.3. Document co-citation analysis
This paper aims to provide research-based evidence for the use of e-books with learning purposes across two periods of research (period I: 2010–2014; period II: 2015–2019). To achieve the research goals, a total of 79 e-book articles with the 1203 follow-up citations were systematically retrieved from the Web of Science, providing a joint research-based foundation as the collective wisdom for the field's view of e-book research. Two quantitative analyses (i.e., document co-citation analysis and social network analysis) were used in this study. First, a document co-citation analysis (DCA) was used as the initial approach to identifying the most frequently cross-referenced articles in the field. According to Small (1973), a co-citation is defined as two published articles which jointly cite some earlier publications as their references.

Following the previous step of data collection, a total of 1203 citations (from 824 journal articles) were treated as citation-based evidence representing a large field of researchers’ views on 79 selected e-book articles. As such, a symmetric matrix of 79 articles was formed, and each cell of co-citation count was calculated if the follow-up 824 citing articles were co-citing them. The larger the co-citation frequency, the stronger the bibliometric similarity between the two jointly-cited articles will be. The matching results of the co-citation relationship showed that 55 of the 79 articles have been co-cited at least one time, while the remaining 24 articles, even though they were accredited by other journal articles, were not referenced together at all (none of the follow-up citing articles co-cited these 24 articles).

Based on the initial results, we identified that 55 e-book articles were the core documents for further analysis, as the remaining 24 articles could not be analyzed by co-citation analysis. Bibliographically, a total of 55 core articles were mainly published in Computers & Education (n = 12), Educational Technology & Society (n = 6), and Interactive Learning Environments (n = 5). On average, the 55 core documents have been cited over 20 times each, with 11 co-cited at least 15 times, showing that they are the main focus of e-book research. From large citers' view, two or more documents can be considered as both important and relevant to each other if they are often cited together. From a methodological angle, the e-book co-citation analysis is especially meaningful to researchers as the analysis used the large independent citers’ view as the basis to jointly identify the main streams of the field.

2.4. Social network analysis
After obtaining the e-book co-citation relationships, social network analysis (SNA) was used as the second approach to providing a visualization platform to facilitate a better understanding of the e-book research network. Based on the SNA, some important relationships of e-book research were able to be further quantitatively characterized and visualized, for example, the potential relationships among research subjects, used methods, and main variables of interest underlying the highly referenced articles. In this present study, the main contribution of combining SNA and co-citation results is to characterize the social structure of the 55 core articles based on nodes (i.e., documents within the network) and the lines or links (relationships or interactions) connecting them in the network. For researchers, it is helpful to have a global view of the whole networking structure of the e-book core research stream. From the perspective of scientometrics, the combination of SNA visualization and co-citation results (i.e., co-citation network diagram) represents the “field's view” of itself (White & Griffith, 1981), providing domain experts with a self-reflection of research direction.

In addition, the degree centrality, a networking indicator measuring the number of links between two nodes in the network (Freeman, 1978), is used to identify the influential articles with unique features in the network. Taken together (co-citation analysis and network visualization), the results of the co-citation network analysis used in this present study aim to provide insights into which important features of e-book research articles were used together, such as the main variables used for the general context and for at-risk students. As such, the co-citation matrix comprised of 55 e-book articles was used as the data input for further social network analysis and visualization. Following previous research, the Netdraw program built-in UCINET version 6.937 (Borgatti, Everette, & Freeman, 2002) was used to position the core papers in the relational network and to identify the central cores (with degree centrality) in the network.

3. Results
This section provides the main findings of the computational results of the document co-citation analysis, and visualized networking diagrams that represent e-book articles’ social relationships across two decades of research. Extended discussions based on the main findings were also organized to answer three research questions of interest.

3.1. Results of co-citation analysis
According to the co-citation analysis, all 55 e-book articles were paired and counted, resulting in a total of 1318 co-citations, among which 11 of the 55 core articles which were jointly cited 835 times (63% of the total number) were identified as the most highly co-cited e-book research. This shows a concentration of 11 core e-book articles that were heavily referenced by a large number of follow-up studies. Among these, most were published in Computers & Education (i.e., 4 of the 11). The remaining highly referenced e-book research was published in the journals Mind Brain and Education, Educational Technology Research and Development, and Reading and Writing, showing the diversified research foci in the mainstream e-book research.

Moreover, we also found that the reseacrh of Woody et al. (2010) (i.e., WoodyDB 2010, as it was co-authored by Daniel and Baker) is the most referenced e-book article in terms of citations (166) and co-citations (129), followed by their series of studies including Daniel and Woody (2013), Parish-Morris, Mahajan, Hirsh-Pasek, Golinkoff, & Collins (2013) and Korat (2010). It is interesting to mention that Korat has been identified as the one of the most productive e-book researchers in Kolle et al. (2018), which is another bibliographic review study on e-books. Besides, Korat and Blau’s (2010) article has been co-cited 115 times, which is almost twice the number of its individual citations (n = 64). This indicates that most of Korat and Blau’s (2010) follow-up studies have cited it together with other core articles. The cell in the diagonal line shows the highest co-citation times of an e-book article that strongly tied with other cores. For example, a series of studies co-authored by Woody and Daniel (WoodyDB2010 and DanielW 2013) have been co-cited a total of 26 times, which was also found to be the highest number of co-citations in this study. Compared with the highest number of ties shown in the diagonal cell, other than the pair of WoodyDB2010 and DanielW 2013 (26 times), we can see that the pairs of WoodyDB2010 and Korat, 2010 (14 times), and WoodyDB2010 and Korat, 2010 (13 times) have stronger bibliographic similarities than other pairs. However, citers (follow-up researchers) only co-cited the other three pairs (WoodyDB2010 and Parish-MorrisMHGC2013, WoodyDB2010 and ShamirKF 2012, WoodyDB2010 and KoratS 2012) one time each. The different co-citation ties in the co-citation matrix also suggest the different strengths of bibliographic relationships between the core articles. The details of the co-citation relationship between the top-referenced e-book articles (co-cited over 50 times or highly tied with a single article over 10 times) are shown in Table 1.

3.2. Results of the e-book co-citation network in the earlier years (2010–2014)
Based on large citers' view, the co-citation result provides a computational understanding of the relationships among each pair of most cited e-book studies. When we map the whole relational structure into a networking diagram, some interesting findings can be further discovered from different perspectives. In this manner, we profile the overall developmental picture of e-book research every 5 years in this study. Moreover, all papers were categorized by research subjects, variables, contexts, methods, and learning tools to reveal the characteristics of the e-book research. The process of categorization was directly adopted from the full-text with a simplified form. Following the visualization, the characteristics were then interpreted. Two experienced researchers coded each paper and discussed any discrepancies. In addition, the research was divided into two periods (period I: 2010–2014; period II: 2015–2019) to provide a further comparison of the e-book development. In the following section, two main characteristics related to the research subjects and main variables of interest were labeled with each article's bibliographic information. For example, Woody et al.’s (2010) research focused on university students' preference for e-books or textbooks, and the label for the research was “#1WoodyDB2010(U-Preference).” After that, all 55 e-book articles were represented as the 55 nodes in the network diagram.

In Fig. 1, the majority of e-book articles in the middle area is mainly for preschoolers and elementary students, while the research for high school and college students is on the left-hand side. Regarding the research objects and contexts, earlier e-book research (Korat, 2010 (#2); Segal-Drori, Korat, Shamir, & Klein, 2010 (#3); Korat & Blau, 2010 (#4)) aimed at young children, including preschoolers (or kindergarteners) and elementary school students. Most of the learning tools used by preschoolers are storybooks to enhance their emerging literacy skills, including print awareness, vocabulary recognition, phonological awareness, and story comprehension (e.g., Korat & Shamir, 2012 (#9); Ihmeideh, 2014 (#20); Shamir & Shlafer, 2011 (#5)). However, the learning context adopted by the elementary school students is diverse, including the understanding of emergent literacy (Korat, Levin, Ben-Shabt, et al., 2014 (#24); Wright, Fugett, & Caputa, 2013 (#14)), general science (Liang & Huang, 2014 (#19)), and classical Chinese poetry (Huang, Liang, Su, & Chen, 2012 (#7)). Several variables for measuring learning outcomes (e.g., vocabulary understanding and spelling, reading accuracy, and retrieval outcomes) were used to evaluate students' academic performances. Among these, some researchers (Parish-Morris, Mahajan, Hirsh-Pasek, Golinkoff, & Collins, 2013 (#12); Segal-Drori et al., 2010 (#3)) believe that adult instruction or co-reading helps young children's literacy development with the use of e-books, which was also considered as mainstream in terms of the preschoolers' e-book use in the network, as it is accredited by more than 15 follow-up studies (shown by the blue line). As for students with a higher education level, researchers assessed these students' preference for e-book use by different outcomes (e.g., reading, reviewing, and navigation) and different disciplines (e.g., psychology (Woody et al., 2010 (#1); Daniel & Woody, 2013 (#11)) and computer science (Li, Chen, & Yang, 2013 (#13)).

Next, regarding learning tools, e-books and printed books are the most commonly used and compared. Conventional e-books are usually displayed on e-readers in digital contexts, such as CD-ROM (Korat & Blau, 2010 (#4)) or e-console books (Parish-Morris et al., 2013 (#12)). With the continuous advancement of technology, e-books with various functions are also constantly developing. Some scholars have developed an interactive e-book learning system to enhance primary school students’ learning through content search, learning process tracking (Huang et al., 2012 (#7); Huang, Liang, & Chiu, 2013 (#15)), and reading rate tracking technology (Liang & Huang, 2014 (#19)). More sophisticated e-book systems have been designed for college students in different disciplines. For example, an e-book reading system with a reading guidance module and an annotation map was developed to improve the navigational and reading performance of computer science students (Li, Fan, Huang, & Chen, 2014 (#23)).

In terms of research methods, more than 80% (20 out of 25) of the e-book research employed quantitative methods, including 16 experimental designs and four survey methods. In the experimental design research, most of the e-book research aimed to compare the effectiveness of the e-book and printed book learning tools (e.g., Daniel & Woody, 2013 (#11); Ihmeideh, 2014 (#20); Korat, Levin, Atishkin, & Turgeman, 2014 (#24); Korat & Blau, 2010 (#4); Segal-Drori et al., 2010 (#3); Shamir & Shlafer, 2011 (#5); Shamir, Korat, & Fellah, 2012 (#8); Wright et al., 2013 (#14)). In addition to the expected performance outcomes (e.g., vocabulary, reading comprehension, and retrieval), other indicators are also used to reflect students' learning process, such as reading habits, motivation (Huang et al., 2013 (#15)), and reading rate (Huang et al., 2012 (#7)). At the same time, the grouping variables used in the experimental research include learning tools (mostly e-books and printed books), adult guidance (or intervention), reading patterns (number of repetitions, silent or normal reading) (Liang & Huang, 2014 (#19); Korat & Blau, 2010 (#4)), and dynamic/static dictionaries (Korat, 2010 (#2); Korat, Levin, Atishkin, & Turgeman, 2014 (#22)). As for the findings of the survey research, students’ perceived usefulness (Lim & Hew, 2014 (#21)) and attitudes towards e-books (Huang et al., 2013 (#15)) will affect their reading behaviors and academic performance. The list of various variables also suggests the main research foci of the earlier e-book research (2010–2014).

Another interesting sub-stream is the investigation of high-risk students, that is, students from low socio-economic status families (SES) (Korat & Blau, 2010 (#4)) or at risk of learning disabilities (ALD) (Shamir & Shlafer, 2011 (#5)). Focusing on emergent literacy skills among young children at risk of learning disabilities, prior studies have confirmed the effectiveness of e-book learning for promoting young children's emergent literacy (Shamir & Shlafer, 2011 (#5)) and the role of adult instruction to use e-books for learning in word reading and phonological awareness, vocabulary, and the concept of print (Korat, Levin, Ben-Shabt, et al., 2014 (#24); Segal-Drori et al., 2010 (#3); Shamir et al., 2012 (#8)). Although most studies have confirmed the effectiveness of e-books for improving students' learning performance, other studies had different findings. Huang et al. (2012) (#7) found that even if elementary students had a better personalized learning experience in the interactive e-book learning system, there was no significant difference in reading accuracy between e-books and printed books. Korat and Shamir (2012) (#9) also found that without the direct support of adults, students reading e-books did not make progress in vocabulary. Parish-Morris et al. (2013) (#12) further pointed out that in the parent-child dialogue reading situation, children's understanding of e-book stories is even worse than with traditional books. It can be seen that the influence of adult intervention on children's learning effectiveness may be greater than the influence of e-books. As for the research on college students, there is no difference in learning outcomes between e-books and paper-based textbook groups (Woody et al., 2010 (#1)). The details of 25 e-book articles are summarized in Table 2.

3.3. Results of the e-book co-citation network in recent years (2015–2019)
The networking structure and the research characteristics of core e-book articles from 2015 to 2019 changed in that the network relationships between 30 e-book articles were not as strong as in previous years (2010–2014). As shown in Fig. 2, e-book research in the central network mainly focuses on young children (labeled as “E” and “K” in the parentheses), while research with higher education levels is scattered above and below the network. In addition, one article (Sung, Hwang, & Yen, 2015 (#26)) on the upper left side was not co-cited with others, and four nodes (i.e., Evans, 2017 (#50); Larson, 2015 (#32); Neumann, 2016 (#36); Neumann, Finger, & Neumann, 2017 (#48)) in the lower right corner are isolated from other studies, showing some special research interests outside the mainstream.

Fig. 2. The e-book research network in the recent 5 years (2015–2019, n = 30).

Taking a close look at the central network within the dotted line, most of the recent e-book research has focused on the research subjects of young children, mainly elementary school students. For young children's e-book use, some researchers have supported the benefits of e-book reading for children's early literacy (Dore et al., 2018 (#52); Korat & Segal-Drori, 2016 (#43)), especially in the situation of co-reading with an adult (Strouse & Ganea, 2016 (#39)). Most e-book studies on elementary students have obtained similar results, that is, they support the effectiveness of e-book learning, such as vocabulary development and reading motivation (Kao, Tsai, Liu, & Yang, 2016 (#37)), reading comprehension (Liang, 2015 (#33), memorization, phonological awareness (Wu & Chen, 2018 (#46)), and vocabulary identification (Barnyak & McNelly, 2016 (#45); Korat & Segal-Drori, 2016 (#43)). However, Neumann (2016) (#36) found that no correlation occurred between preschoolers' emergent literacy abilities and frequency of e-book reading.

In terms of the research context, the recent research also provides more diverse learning contexts, such as Chinese (Wu & Chen, 2018 (#46)), mathematics (Hwang & Lai, 2017 (#27)), English (Hwang, Liu, Chen, Huang, & Li, 2015 (#30)), novels (Lee, Wu, & Tsai, 2009 (#49)), and health education (Sung et al., 2015 (#26)). Overall, it was found that using e-books is an effective approach for enhancing students' reading motivation (Barnyak & McNelly, 2016 (#45)) and self-efficacy (Hwang & Lai, 2017 (#47)). In the e-book research on the periphery of the network structure, the research subjects are mainly high school or college students. For e-book use in higher education (e.g., university students' e-book use), a more diverse research context can be found than the networking structure in previous years (2010–2014), including English (Liu & Leveridge, 2017 (#51); Wu, 2016 (#46)), mathematics (Turel & Sanal, 2018 (#53)), engineering (Jou, Tennyson, Wang, & Huang, 2016 (#35)), Chinese (Wang & Yang, 2016 (#42)) and novel reading (Chen, Chang, Wang, & Jian, 2018 (#55); Evans, 2017 (#50)). In general, the results show that using e-books can improve students’ learning attitudes towards e-books and reading comprehension (Chou, 2016 (#40); Wu, 2016 (#46)). It is particularly mentioned that some recent studies have suggested that the use of an e-book-based system allows students to achieve better results in mathematics tests and also reduces their anxiety about mathematics (Turel & Sanal, 2018 (#53)).

However, researchers have also pointed out some problems with using e-books. For example, one study showed that for pre-teachers, using an e-book is very challenging because e-book devices will distract them, make their eyes tired, and make them feel overwhelmed because of too many choices (Dobler, 2015 (#28)). Other research has also reported that low-interactivity (pace-control only) e-books can prevent children from being distracted by excessive media stimulation due to limited cognitive capacity and processing ability (Ma & Wei, 2016 (#38); Wang & Yang, 2016 (#42)). The details of 30 recent e-book articles are shown in Table 3.

3.4. Trends of e-book research across two periods of research (2010–2019)
To identify the research trend, further analysis and comparison of e-book research across the two research periods from 2010 to 2019 are summarized in Table 4. First of all, in terms of research subjects, the number of e-book studies involving elementary school students increased significantly from six studies in the early period to 12 in recent years, while the number of studies on preschool children plummeted from 10 to four studies. Moreover, the number of e-book studies on college students remained unchanged, and two studies on high school students were added.

Next, some differences in the research context between the two research periods can be found. Even though the storybook research (for child learning) decreased from 10 to six studies, it still accounts for the largest share. The majority of research topics in the early period (2010–2014) included psychology and computer science, while the topics in the recent 5 years (2015–2019) were English and mathematics, and three other studies used a novel as the learning material for research (Chen et al., 2018; Evans, 2017). A continuous research learning focus in both of these two research periods is the effectiveness of Chinese learning aimed at elementary school students. Moreover, in terms of research focal variables, academic performance (or learning effect) through e-book use is the main research focus (with an increase from 8 to 20 studies). Due to the decrease in research on preschool children, the number of studies exploring emerging literacy has decreased from 10 to two. In the last 5 years, learning motivation (Turel & Sanal, 2018) and e-book satisfaction (Wu & Chen, 2018) were considered to be the most important factors affecting learning behavior and results.

Regarding research methods, these two research periods have one thing in common, that is, most of the research adopted an experimental design (in the first 5 years, it accounted for half of the research, and in the last 5 years it accounted for two-thirds). Most empirical studies compared the learning effects on different groups, for example, printed books and e-books, and the number of repeated readings. In addition, the success of experimental design research may depend on some grouping variables to divide the participants into control and treatment/experimental groups, such as different learning tools, adult intervention, and different learning patterns. The second major research area is to do with e-book investigations, which increased from five in the early research stage to six studies in the later stage. In empirical research, the motivation and satisfaction of using e-books have often been investigated in the past 5 years.

Finally, the research has shown the diversity of digital learning tools. We can see the development of e-books, from the early CD-ROM or electronic console books to the multi-functionality of iPads, applications (apps), and e-book systems in recent years. Mobile tools such as Kindle Fire, iPad, and apps (Jou et al., 2016; Neumann, 2016; Sackstein, Spark, & Jenkins, 2015) demonstrated the advantages of mobile learning, which can break through the limitations of time and place. In recent years, e-book systems have presented more complex learning functions. For example, multimedia e-readers with annotations (Hwang et al., 2015) and e-books with thinking maps (Chen et al., 2018) have been developed to adapt to different student backgrounds and learning goals. It can be expected that e-book systems with more advanced functions will become important learning aids in the future.

One more issue that needs to be taken account of is the decreasing number of research targets at risk for learning students or students from SES families (a drop from five to one study in the research period). Prior studies indicated that children's literacy development is related to the SES of their families (Korat & Blau, 2010). It is essential to continue developing these early research results (e.g., Segal-Drori et al., 2010; Shamir & Shlafer, 2011), to identify students with learning disabilities, and to employ appropriate learning tools (e.g., e-books) or learning strategies to help them improve their vocabulary and reading comprehension in their early learning stages. This will ensure that at-risk students do not fall behind too much, thus revealing the importance of the e-book research in this field.

4. Discussion
Overall, this present study is a very first attempt to provide a fresh understanding of how e-books support learning with research-based evidence by using co-citation network analysis. The result of co-citation network analysis has identified some highly referenced research pairs across the two periods of interest. In the first period (2010–2014), the research pairs of “Woody et al. (2010) and Daniel and Woody (2013)” and “Segal-Dror et al. (2010) and Parish-Morris et al. (2013)” were identified as the two most influential pairs of e-book research in the first period, as the two pairs have been co-cited 26 and 15 times, respectively. In the recent period (2015–2019), while “Kao et al. (2016) and Barnyak and McNelly (2016)” have been co-cited two times in the main component of the network, “Neumann (2016) and Neumann et al. (2017)” have been co-cited three times but located in an isolated component. Future research directions can be tracked from these heavy co-citation lines (also considered to be the most highly jointly cited e-book research) because they have been highly referenced by a large number of follow-up studies.

As seen in Fig. 1, in the early years of e-book study (2010–2014), the thickest line connected the research of Woody et al. (2010) and Daniel and Woody (2013). When we searched for documents citing these two papers at the same time from the WoS (i.e., co-citing papers), we could analyze these later citing papers to understand the research trends or research topics. What Woody (2010) and Daniel and Woody (2013) have in common is that they both target college students taking psychology courses. In addition, the research results also show that, compared with traditional textbooks, students are more satisfied with the use of e-books, but there is no significant difference in the learning effects. When we analyzed these citing papers, many of them also investigated the learning effects of e-books on college students, but in different research contexts (discipline), including physiology (Rhodes & Rozell, 2015), engineering (Gyllen, Stahovich, & Mayer, 2018), and biology (Van Horne, Henze, Schuh, Colvin, & Russell, 2017). However, other studies investigated young children and compared the learning outcomes of e-books and printed books (Liang, 2015). Then, we looked into the second highly referenced research pair of Segal-Dror et al. (2010) and Parish-Morris et al. (2013). What they have in common is that they explored the effectiveness of e-books used by preschoolers while being guided by adults. Likewise, when searching for co-citing papers, we can find similar research topics, that is, comparing the impact of e-books and printed storybooks on preschoolers (e.g., Richter & Courage, 2017), or the impact of parent-child interaction on reading (Strouse & Ganea, 2017).

Next, the two lines in the last 5 years (2015–2019) were discussed. As shown in Fig. 2, a co-citation tie connects the studies of Kao et al. (2016) and Barnyak and McNelly (2016) in the main component of the network. While Kao et al.’s (2016) research showed that the reading motivation and story comprehension of primary school students are higher in high-interactive e-books than in low-interactive e-books, Barnyak and McNelly's (2016) study attributed students' ability to accurately retell a story with the support or intervention of adults. One of their follow-up studies conducted a meta-analysis to examine the effect of e-book use on literacy outcomes for students in grades K-12 (Swanson et al., 2020). The results showed that e-books can be used as an alternative for traditional printed books to improve students' reading comprehension. The second co-citation ties are Neumann's series of research (Neumann, 2016; Neumann et al., 2017). Their research focuses on the emergent literacy of young children. One paper co-citing Neumann's research is a systematic review that explores the role of technologies in childhood education (Gonzalez-Gonzalez, Guzman-Franco, & Infante-Moro, 2019), while the other focuses on multiliteracies in digital writing (Cordero, Nussbaum, Ibaseta, Otaíza, & Chiuminatto, 2018).

In sum, we can infer that articles obtained from the co-citation analysis and presented in the social network structure are the most influential papers in e-book research. The research results of these core papers can provide a strong basis for e-book research for follow-up research. In addition, future research can build a foundation based on strongly linked papers, and can expand the research to different environments.

4.1. Implications of the findings from a co-citation perspective
Based on the main findings of the co-citation network, two implications were concluded. First, following the mainstream of e-book research on preschoolers' emerging literacy in the first period (2010–2014), future studies may design storybooks for preschoolers' use to enhance their emerging literacy skills, including print awareness, vocabulary recognition, and phonological awareness, which are the most often used main variables in the e-book research. For elementary school students, e-books were designated for higher level purposes of learning, such as fundamental science learning. We also suggest that high-risk students’ e-book use can be another research interest for future studies, including emergent literacy skills among young children at risk of learning disabilities, and the role of adult instruction in the use of e-books.

Second, researchers extended e-book use at various education levels in more diverse learning contexts (e.g., mathematics, novel reading, and health education) in the second period of research (2015–2019). In terms of young children's e-book use, future studies may further explore the potential benefits of e-book reading for children's early literacy, especially in the situation of co-reading with an adult. For those learners at the higher education level (e.g., university students), future research may develop some e-book-based systems for them to achieve better results and also to reduce their anxiety in learning. Follow-up researchers may also broaden the former research into different formal learning contexts (e.g., biology, engineering, and arts). Other directions include some potential problems and challenges that existing e-book research encountered, such as issues of eyestrain in the context of pre-teachers’ use, and the limited cognitive capacity and processing ability in the context of children's use.

4.2. Limitations
Overall, this present study provides a fresh understanding of how e-books support learning with research-based evidence by using co-citation network analysis. As an exploratory attempt, some research limitations of this study are noted here. Following previous co-citation research, only high-quality citations from journal articles were used as research-based evidence; articles and references sourced from book chapters and conference proceedings were not included in the analysis. It is suggested that researchers may include citations from a broader range of literature to expand the evidence pool in future studies. More diversified sources (e.g., Scopus) on all related aspects may be considered. Moreover, this study focused on e-book research with educational purposes, such as learning and teaching. Therefore, the research scope is limited to education and educational research. Other than the educational focus, e-book research has also attracted computer scientists, library and information science researchers, and some business analysts. It is suggested that future studies can expand the research scope to compare the scholarly networks of e-book research in different disciplines.
