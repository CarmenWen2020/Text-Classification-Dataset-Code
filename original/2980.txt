This study used international student achievement data from the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 to identify the profiles of school digital inclusion (SDI). In digitally inclusive schools, students who live in the digital era benefit from digital technology and a digitally enhanced educational environment without alienation and exclusion. We compiled profiles of SDI by conducting a latent profile analysis on data from 27 countries. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine whether a school's socioeconomic status and type could predict its likelihood of fitting a particular profile across SDI subgroups. Schools were categorized in terms of low-, medium-, and high-level digital inclusion. Socioeconomic status and type of school were significant predictors of profile membership. Based on the results, the practical implications for promoting SDI include digital infrastructure as a prerequisite, teachers' confidence in using digital technology and instructional competence, and the digital skills of teachers and students.

1. Introduction
In the digital era, schools are agents in ensuring that all students benefit from digital technology, as a means of supporting the needs of diverse students and enabling them to have their needs met in an inclusive environment (Hamburg & Lütgen, 2019). Not all students have access to education and the advantages of digital technology in their schools or homes (Liao, Chang, Wang, & Sun, 2016). Inequity in students' experiences with digital technology deepens through multiple characteristics such as socioeconomic level and gender, and in terms of their technological skills and confidence with using new technology (Adhikari, Scogings, Mathrani, & ; Liao et al., 2016). Under the exacerbating circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, students with lower socioeconomic status (SES) have faced difficulties in accessing online educational services, content, and management systems (Van Lancker & Parolin, 2020), exposing and even widening existing gaps in education. Although there has been an effort to address this gap through the implementation of digital inclusion in schools, schools are currently facing complex and unpredictable challenges worldwide, such as teaching and learning online without adequate infrastructure, support, and readiness (Almaiah, Al-Khasawneh, & Althunibat, 2020; Beaunoyer, Dupéré, & Guitton, 2020; Dhawan, 2020). Digital inclusion is important because students’ lack of positive and equitable digital experiences during their school years may widen existing educational and digital gaps in the long term.

Schools should develop an inclusive environment for the provision of learning opportunities for all students to prepare them for a digitally networked and advanced future society. Current inequitable practices at schools relate to the complex ecologies in and around schools, influenced by school funding, teachers' educational practices, schools' actions toward issues related to digital equity, and students’ family and social backgrounds (Ainscow, Dyson, Goldrick, & West, 2012; Clark, Dyson, Millward, & Robson, 1999; Scherer, Rohatgi, & Hatlevik, 2017). To mitigate inequity among students exposed to this complex context, one important approach is the adoption of digital advancement in schools (Burke & Hughes, 2017). Currently, digital technologies have been applied within schools because they are believed to add value to the processes of student learning and knowledge acquisition (Ferraro, 2018). Globally, all students, as future members of society, should develop the capacity to participate in the information and network society through universal access to digital technology and advanced user experiences, regardless of their SES, disability, race, ethnicity, national origin, or gender (Van Dijk, 2020).

The significance of information and communication technology (ICT) in twenty-first-century schools has led to the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) including information about ICT resources, ICT use, and ICT skills in questionnaires (Hu, Gong, Lai, & Leung, 2018). That is, the PISA provides abundant information on ICT in education. Although studies on digital literacy using PISA data are plentiful, research on digital inequity and school digital inclusion is scarce.

In this study, we propose the concept of school digital inclusion (SDI) for all students using the PISA 2018. Digital inclusion for all students with heterogeneous digital readiness requires the efforts and commitment of both schools and teachers (Hatlevik & Christophersen, 2013; Mavrou & Loizou-Raouna, 2017). This conceptual approach can identify the status and stimulate the enhancement of digital infrastructure, support systems, and the role of teachers as enablers of digital inclusion at schools. However, given the lack of knowledge and research on how schools understand and create the conditions for a more digitally inclusive environment for students (Stenman & Pettersson, 2020), this study aims to advance such knowledge.

2. Conceptual framework
2.1. Digital technology contributing to inclusion in schools
Digital technologies help build inclusive learning environments and provide more equitable learning experiences in schools with diverse student needs (Burke & Hughes, 2017; Mavrou & Loizou-Raouna, 2017). Using digital technologies and improving teacher orientation toward inclusion can enable all students to have educational opportunities through personalized learning, access to internet-based resources, and expanded classroom boundaries, depending on teachers' pedagogical approaches (Kim, Choi, & Lee, 2019; Spires, Oliver, & Corn, 2011). For example, students with individual needs can adopt online video technology, find and organize information, collaborate, discuss with people remotely, engage in creative activities, solve quizzes without exhausting tutors, and experiment virtually to enlarge their educational experiences. As digital technology's ability to meet individual needs has been improved, personalized digital devices such as tablet computers have been widely adopted in schools due to their multifunctionality and low prices (Balanskat et al., 2013; Burke & Hughes, 2017; Pruet, Ang, & Farzin, 2016).

To create a digitally inclusive school, school digital learning environments should focus on building technology infrastructure and teacher preparedness to support equitable education for all students, based on inclusive pedagogy (Florian & Beaton, 2018; Pettersson, 2018; Stenman & Pettersson, 2020). Differences in knowledge, skills, and ICT user experiences in schools can lead to segmented usage patterns and substantial discrepancies in students’ ability to develop usage patterns. To lessen such differences, students need to have high-quality ICT experiences, which requires training opportunities and digital infrastructure informed by inclusive pedagogy (Floriana & Black-Hawkins, 2011) and instructional practices that foreground inclusion.

2.2. School digital inclusion
SDI is the capability of a school to ensure that all students have engaged in educational experiences with digital technologies for social inclusion. Although schools are considered as agents of both social inclusion and exclusion (Razer, Friedman, & Warshofsky, 2013), the role and characteristics of schools in terms of digital inclusion have not been discussed in depth. Digital inclusion is a multi-dimensional concept encompassing infrastructure, access, use, and outcomes (Park, 2017; Helsper, 2012). Digital inclusion is aimed at the elimination of barriers to digital technologies, allowing individuals to regain a sense of control over their lives, thus increasing their ability to participate in various life domains (Mariën & Prodnik, 2014). In schools, the digital divide—or current inequalities in access to the latest information technologies (Salemink, Strijker, & Bosworth, 2017)—can cause exclusion by limiting participation in communities and societies, educational resources, and education policies. SDI consists of digital infrastructure and school resources for technology integration. Such infrastructure and resources are particularly needed in rural schools, given the digital divide between rural and urban students (Liao et al., 2016). Digital inclusion in schools requires finding higher-quality educational content and information that are relevant to students’ needs; improve their school and future lives; and contribute to student growth and success through supporting access, capability, and outcomes. As a complex phenomenon that depends on digital skills, social support, and motivations (Correa & Pavez, 2016), digital inclusion targets barriers such as a lack of infrastructure, low income and affordability, limited digital literacy, and a lack of incentives to go online (e.g., a lack of cultural and social acceptance of internet use, poor awareness and understanding of the internet, and a lack of available and attractive local content) (Adkins & Sandy, 2020; Schmida, Bernard, Zakaras, Lovegrove, & Swingle, 2017). To promote digital inclusion, these barriers should be eliminated or given special attention. In particular, dynamic actions are required to ensure SDI in community settings.

To ensure digital inclusion for all students, we propose a conceptual framework based on three components. First, digital inclusion requires the development of sufficient digital infrastructure for education, including digital devices, internet access, and applications. Digitally inclusive schools must have sufficient broadband internet speed for educational activities, and schools should have an adequate number of digital devices to meet educational needs. Schools also need to provide software and content for educational activities with ICTs. Second, digital inclusion requires sufficient school support for educational integration with digital technologies, including the promotion of educational outcomes through teacher support in the form of policies, resources, and assistants. Moreover, schools should provide technical support for both teachers and students. Third, digital inclusion requires sufficient digital literacy for both teachers and students, as well as school administrators, for adequate instruction and support. Students need an appropriate level of digital literacy to participate in the classroom, while teachers should have adequate pedagogical skills for integrating technology into instructional activities. To achieve this, schools should conduct digital literacy training for students and teachers rather than leaving the responsibility for development to the individual.

2.2.1. Digital infrastructure in schools
To enable digital inclusion in schools for all students, a digital infrastructure with internet and broadband connectivity in schools should be able to support stable access to network environments using digital devices. Internet connectivity is important in terms of access to information, social recognition from the community, and equity in social settings (Katz & Gonzalez, 2016). It also improves learning conditions and educational results through better access to resources in educational settings (Salinas & Sánchez, 2009). Digital infrastructure consists of the underlying physical components that are required for educational systems to operate for all students and teachers with the aim of equal provision. For connectivity and adoption to be helpful in schools, individuals must be able to effectively use applications and content.

School access to technology is closely related to technology integration and can predict technology integration for instruction (Liu, Ritzhaupt, Dawson, & Barron, 2017). To incorporate technology-integrated education into the curriculum, digital infrastructure should include internet, digital devices (computers, tablets, or laptops), a learning management system, digital content, and software or licenses. As a fundamental requirement, the availability of the internet at school is known to have a positive impact on students’ academic success (Erdogdu & Erdogdu, 2015).

In digitally inclusive schools, digital infrastructure, resources, and policy can stimulate universal and equal access to educational resources for teachers and students. Teachers in resource-rich schools tend to have significantly more access to and more frequent and creative adoption of ICT; they also engage more frequently with other teachers in professional development (Salinas & Sánchez, 2009; Valadez & Duran, 2007; Wang, 2013). Schools in underserved areas should have better digital connectivity than schools in other areas because a well-established internet infrastructure influences students' educational experiences and competence in rural areas (Liao et al., 2016; Salinas & Sánchez, 2009; Wang, 2013). In addition, school contexts and structures, teachers' preparation time for classes using technology, and class schedules influence teachers’ use of ICT in classroom activities (Salinas & Sánchez, 2009).

Schools often serve as mediators of digital inclusion in the local community (Salinas & Sánchez, 2009). Social and economic advantages or disadvantages in the local community are mechanically associated with access to or the use of information through the internet (Ritzhaupt, Liu, Dawson, & Barron, 2013; Stern, Adams, & Elsasser, 2009; Witte & Mannon, 2009). Schools in rural areas serve an additional role by disseminating technology and providing equal access to not only students but also their families (Salinas & Sánchez, 2009).

2.2.2. School support for technology integration
With the acquisition of infrastructure in schools, schools aiming for digital inclusion should provide continuous support to teachers to enable them to continually leverage digital technology in education, including providing training opportunities to enhance students' and teachers’ use of digital technology (Ritzhaupt et al., 2013; Salinas & Sánchez, 2009). The provision of digital infrastructure does not automatically lead to technology adoption (Park, 2017; Salinas & Sánchez, 2009). The digital integration of all schools can be achieved successfully through various supportive environments.

Teachers in digitally inclusive schools have adequate professional training for digital integration and should constantly refresh and upgrade their skills (Salinas & Sánchez, 2009). According to Ritzhaupt et al. (2013), schools need to invest in the professional development of teachers in terms of technology integration in the classroom and sustain support through careful planning to build infrastructure and enhance digital skills. Additionally, schools should create an operating manual of digital tools for educational purposes to support technology integration in the classroom and provide technical staff or other support for teachers regarding technology integration.

In addition to access to technology, the level of school support for teachers influences teachers' success with technology integration in classrooms (Liu et al., 2017; Salinas & Sánchez, 2009). Indeed, teachers’ perceptions of school support for technology integration impact their confidence and comfort in using technology in the classroom (Liu et al., 2017).

2.2.3. Digital literacy of students and teachers
The acquisition and development of digital literacy and its application are important for schools as they are key enablers of active members of the network society. Digital literacy, defined as digital skills and competence to engage with the information and knowledge society, has become more than the ability to operate ICT (Karpati, 2011). Digitally literate people have the skills to actively contribute to a digitally inclusive society (Thompson, Jaeger, Taylor, Subramaniam, & Bertot, 2014).

The acquisition of digital literacy should be embedded in social practices developed in meaningful rather than neutral and decontextualized settings. Thus, schools can provide active and meaningful contexts for students' learning practices (Meneses & Mominó, 2010). Students' digital skills should not be left to individuals, but rather schools should take responsibility for their digital skills as part of their education. The level of a student's digital skills is related to their SES and is significantly influenced by the digital environment of their home as well as the attitudes and interests of their parents (Areepattamannil & Khine, 2017; Ritzhaupt et al., 2013). That is, the quality of digital experiences varies depending on the personal environment. Thus, the complementary role of schools is particularly important. Schools should not consider students' digital skills merely as basic technical knowledge or provide digital skills training via short courses or separate sessions with instruction (Scherer et al., 2017). Instead, schools should adopt a systematic approach toward technology-related preparedness with technology-integrated instruction (Kim & Kim, 2017).

Additionally, teachers need digital skills to find, evaluate, and use information and educational resources to achieve educational goals. Teachers should possess pedagogical skills that allow them to integrate technologies into their instruction to serve all students' differing needs. Unfortunately, teachers' abilities to integrate technology into instruction are affected by external factors such as physical infrastructure, school support, local SES, and available resources. For example, whether teachers work in rural or urban schools influences their teaching practices with technologies given physical and usage constraints on their teaching practices (Goh & Kale, 2016). In other words, teachers' digital competence can contribute to overcoming digital gaps in schools by fostering the conditions necessary for students’ adoption of technology as well as by facilitating access and the transfer of knowledge to communities (Salinas & Sánchez, 2009).

2.3. Predictors of school digital inclusion
To examine the predictors of SDI, two indicators—type of school and SES—were included.

School type—public or private—can be used as an alternative indicator of SES in school data, in the place of individual students’ socioeconomic data (Piovesan, Pádua, ). Private schools—schools that are privately owned but publicly funded and schools that are privately owned and funded—exist alongside public schools in many countries, although there are exceptions (Dronkers & Robert, 2008). The PISA data showed that there were relatively few 15-year-old students attending private schools in rural areas, compared to private schools in urban areas (OECD, 2016). Previous studies have identified differences in effectiveness between public and private schools, including educational environments, such as the use of digital devices and access to the internet (Ferraro, 2018). This implies that school type is related to the socioeconomic background of students and their families, as well as the use of digital technologies. The effect of school type on educational outcomes is known to depend on multiple factors, such as the socioeconomic profiles of students and schools in OECD countries (OECD, 2016).

Students' SES is significantly associated with their access to and skills related to using digital technologies, and the average level of student socioeconomic background is associated with student digital technology use in instruction and digital skills (Aesaert et al., 2015; Zhong, 2011). Schools vary in their concentrations of poverty and are influenced by the existence of a social context effect (Weir, Errity, & McAvinue, 2015). Students’ SES is characteristic of both urban and rural education and includes their educational outcomes and the completion of secondary school (Perry & Mcconney, 2010; Weir et al., 2015). Although there is a difference between high and low SES schools, both have increased their policies for allowing students to check out digital resources (Hohlfeld, Ritzhaupt, & Barron, 2010).

2.4. Research model
In this study, we focused on school-level aggregated digital infrastructure, integration for instruction, and digital literacy in relation to SDI, drawing on the conceptual framework illustrated below, to generate school profiles. Our research model is shown in Fig. 1. Overall, we addressed two research questions (RQs). First, do different latent school profiles of digital inclusion exist, and, if so, how many profiles describing the digital inclusion patterns of schools in the participating PISA 2018 countries can be separated? (RQ 1) Second, which school characteristics predict the inclusion of schools in these profiles? (RQ 2).

3. Methods
3.1. Participants
The participants in the study were 15-year-old students from 27 countries who completed the PISA 2018 survey questionnaire, school questionnaire, and ICT familiarity questionnaire. The PISA 2018 adopted a two-stage sampling procedure to select a representative sample of 15-year-old students from each country as a systematic probability proportional to size sampling (OECD, 2019b). First, at least 150 schools were selected in each country. Then, about 42 15-year-old students in each school were randomly selected to participate. Data were collected from two questionnaires distributed to school principals and students. The dataset for the study combined the school questionnaire, completed by the principals, and aggregate values from the ICT familiarity questionnaire, completed by the students. To collect information about the school context, PISA asked the principals of the schools to respond to questionnaires. The school questionnaire consisted of five parts and focused on school background, management, and teaching staff. The student questionnaire used in this study, aggregated by each school, was the computer familiarity questionnaire, which was an optional questionnaire for students in the PISA 2018 (OECD, 2019a). A total of 211 schools were excluded from the dataset of 7794 schools because of missing values for variables under consideration in this study. Thus, the final sample was comprised of 7583 schools from Australia (n = 641), Austria (n = 270), Chile (n = 219), the Czech Republic (n = 303), Denmark (n = 256), Estonia (n = 230), Finland (n = 196), France (n = 206), Germany (n = 170), Greece (n = 219), Hungary (n = 222), Iceland (n = 119), Italy (n = 490), Japan (n = 183), Korea (n = 177), Latvia (n = 280), Lithuania (n = 356), Mexico (n = 253), New Zealand (n = 179), Poland (n = 238), the Slovak Republic (n = 325), Slovenia (n = 279), Spain (n = 1005), Switzerland (n = 222), Turkey (n = 185), the United Kingdom (n = 222), and the United States (n = 138).

3.2. Measures
To answer our RQs, we adopted PISA 2018's measures of school ICT status in the school questionnaire. The question items are validated by the OECD and freely available to the public. Except for the covariates described below, these measures came from the students' ICT familiarity questionnaire and the background survey.

3.2.1. School digital inclusion
To explore school digital infrastructure in terms of SDI, the six PISA indicators used were sufficient digital devices, sufficient internet bandwidth or speed, sufficient digital devices for instruction, powerful digital devices, availability of adequate software, and an online learning support platform. For school support for technology integration, the six PISA indicators were sufficient preparation time for teachers, teacher resources for technology use, incentives for teachers, technical assistance staff, professional development for teachers’ technology use, and school policies for technology use. For school digital literacy, the two indicators were teacher skills for technology integration and student digital literacy (see Appendix).

3.2.2. Predictors of school digital inclusion
Type of school: The schools were classified into two groups: public and private. A public school is managed by a public education authority, government agency, or governing board. A private school is managed by a non-governmental organization. Type of school tends to be adopted as an indicator of SES. In this study, 1 denoted a public school and 0 a private school.

Economic, social, and cultural status (ESCS): To explore the effects of the variables measuring SDI, we used the indicator of a school's ESCS, which captures SES. The overall ESCS of each school was constructed from the responses given by students in their background questionnaire regarding parental education and occupation, learning resources in the home, and cultural possessions. The ESCS indicator was calculated by attributing equal weight to these three standardized components (OECD, 2019a). The ESCS value was transformed, with 0 as the score of an average OECD student and 1 as the standard deviation across equally weighted OECD countries.

3.3. Data analysis
To identify the overall profiles of SDI in all countries, we used multiple statistical analyses: a latent profile analysis (LPA) and multinomial logistic analysis. LPA is a model-based probabilistic clustering approach that groups cases into homogenous subgroups based on underlying similarities (Lubke & Muthén, 2005). The indicators for LPA were standardized scores (M = 0, SD = 1) for each school. In the study, LPA was used to identify the overall profiles of SDI with 14 indicators. LPA is a probabilistic approach to identify substantively meaningful subgroups using a set of continuous observed variables (Olivera-Aguilar & Rikoon, 2018). This approach is superior to other clustering approaches because it accounts for measurement error in the estimates of within-class residual variance in profile membership (Muthen & Muthen, 2000) and provides fit statistics to decide the number of profiles (Marsh, Lüdtke, Trautwein, & Morin, 2009). Once the best fitting latent profile was selected, covariates were added to the latent profile to examine their relations with the profile solution. After the final model had been identified, we added the two indicators (ESCS and type of school) to the LPA models as covariates. The number of optimal profiles in the study was determined via multiple model fit indices including the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and sample-size-adjusted BIC (SABIC), as well as entropy values (Jung & Wickrama, 2008; Nylund, Asparouhov, & Muthén, 2007; Vermunt, 2017). We chose the k-profile model with BIC and AIC values showing the largest decrease compared to a k-1 profile model (Nylund et al., 2007). In addition, a bootstrapped likelihood ratio test (BLRT; McLachlan & Peel, 2000), the Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test (LMR-LRT), and the Vuong-Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test (VLMR-LRT; Lo, Mendell, & Rubin, 2001; Vuong, 1989) were used as fit indices. The optimal class solution had lower BIC and SABIC values; LMR-LRT p < 0.05, BLRT p < 0.05, higher entropy values > .70, parsimony, and conceptual meaning (Nylund et al., 2007).

A set of 14 indicators for school digital infrastructure (6 indicators), school support for technology integration (6 indicators), and school digital literacy (2 indicators) was used to create the profiles. ESCS and type of school were used to predict profile membership. All measures were standardized (M = 0, SD = 1) for ease of interpretation and to ensure that the scaling of the variables did not influence the final results. Subsequently, we examined the effects of covariates on the latent profile memberships of the optimal model in each group. To examine the quality of SDI in all schools, we conducted statistical analyses using SPSS 23 for preliminary and multinomial logistic analyses, as well as LPA using Mplus Version 8.4 (Muthén & Muthén, 1998–2017). Robust maximum likelihood estimation was adopted to correct for possible bias due to the non-normal data.

4.2. Profiles of school digital inclusion
The first RQ sought to determine the number of profiles that describe the patterns of SDI. To assess the optimal latent class structure of the data, we compared the fit index of multiple models. We estimated the 1- through 5-class solutions for each country separately to examine whether there were different profile solutions. Table 2 provides an overview of the information criteria for each model, entropy values, and the results of the LRT between adjacent LPA models. Both the value of the log likelihood and the information criteria decreased significantly between the two- and three-profile models; for the models with more profiles, these values decreased further, yet to a smaller extent. All entropies were sufficiently high (>0.80) and suggested an acceptable classification accuracy of SDI in the latent profiles. Between the models with two and three profiles, the entropy decreased. Concerning the LRTs, the corresponding p-values indicated an improvement in model fit when comparing the three-profile model with the four-profile model. The best fitting solution resulted in three profiles: Profile 1, comprising 21% of the sample, had high digital inclusion; Profile 2, accounting for 52% of the sample, showed medium digital inclusion; and Profile 3, containing 27% of the sample, had low digital inclusion.

4.3. Characteristics of the profiles
To understand the association between the SDI profiles and socioeconomic characteristics of the schools, a multinomial logistic regression was conducted with school ESCS and type of school (public and private; Table 4). Odds ratios (ORs) are the probability of how a one-unit change in a predictor changes the likelihood of membership to a particular profile, compared to the reference profile.

The likelihood of membership in the SDI profiles showed significant associations with ESCS and type of school. First, a comparison between the low and high SDI profiles indicated that school ESCS and type of school had significant effects (OR = 2.5, p < 0.001). As indicated by the ORs, membership in the high SDI profile was 2.5 times more likely for every one-unit increase in school ESCS. This means that schools with higher SES were more likely to belong to the high SDI profile. Further, membership in the high SDI profile was 0.5 times less likely for every one-unit increase in the type of school, implying that private schools were likely to belong to the high SDI profile. Second, a comparison between the low and medium SDI profiles showed that school ESCS and type of school were significant predictors. Public schools were 0.8 times less likely to be in the medium SDI profile relative to the low SDI profile. For every one-unit increase in school ESCS, schools with higher SES were 1.7 times more likely to be in the medium SDI profile relative to the low SDI profile. This means that schools with higher SES and private schools were more likely to belong to the medium SDI profile. Third, a comparison between the high and medium SDI profiles showed that when school ESCS increased by one, being a member of the medium SDI profile was 0.7 times less likely than being a member of the high SDI profile; as the type of school increased by one, being a member of the medium SDI profile was 1.6 times more likely relative to the high SDI profile. Schools with higher ESCS were less likely to belong to the medium SDI profile than schools with lower ESCS. Public schools were more likely to belong to the medium SDI profile than the high SDI profile.

From the results of the multinomial logistic regression, we found that the SDI profiles could be relatively well-explained by schools’ socioeconomic background.

5. Discussion
This study examined latent profiles of SDI using PISA 2018 data to identify homogeneous and meaningful groups. We included school digital infrastructure, school support for technology integration, and school digital literacy indicators as core components of the structure of SDI and identified three distinct groups: low SDI, high SDI, and medium SDI. We also examined the extent to which schools' characteristics contributed to the distinction between profiles. We found that factors related to SES predicted group membership, which has implications for the development of interventions to enhance schools’ readiness for digital inclusion.

5.1. Profiles of school digital inclusion
With reference to the first RQ, we found evidence demonstrating the existence of three profiles in SDI across the 27 countries that participated in the PISA 2018: low, medium, and high SDI. The existence of such profiles suggests the existence of different patterns among schools in terms of digital infrastructure, professional development for technology integration, and digital literacy in the digital era. The three profiles differed significantly in terms of readiness to adopt digital technology for all students, suggesting that not all schools are at the same level of readiness. Thus, there is heterogeneity among groups of digitally inclusive schools for all students. We found that around half of the schools could be classified as having a high likelihood (>52%) for Profile 2 (medium SDI), with the remainder either high-level (21%) or low-level (27%) SDI. Profile 3, low SDI, showed overall low values for all indicators on the three subscales. Profile 1, high SDI, was the smallest group, characterized by high values for indicators on all three subscales.

Schools in the three profiles differed largely in the extent to which they had developed digital infrastructure and supported teachers' technology integration. Technology integration in schools does not just focus on completing the curriculum without interaction with the broader community or parents. Schools tend to play the role of a supplementary place for supporting inclusion for students who have experienced exclusion from a digitally enhanced life. To sustain the continuity of education for students, school digital infrastructure, teachers' technology integration, and digital literacy are core considerations for helping students who are at risk of discontinuing education. In particular, the COVID-19 drove the transformation of typical school education into remote or online learning. However, schools need to ensure learning continuity through connectedness between schools and vulnerable students during the time of physical school closures (UN, 2020), and students’ SES influences the quality of their learning continuity.

High SDI schools, the smallest of the three profiles (21.1%), had sufficient digital devices connected to the internet, sufficient internet bandwidth, sufficient digital devices for instruction, high availability of adequate software, and high school capacity for using online learning support platforms. Schools in this group had a better status than other groups of schools. One of the major barriers of digital inclusion for all students is the lack of infrastructure. Digital infrastructure in schools, as the fundamental component of SDI, requires high investment and a systematic approach in developing a high SDI context. Importantly, we determined that high SDI schools provided better support for teachers' technology integration. Teachers are key enablers of the continuous and appropriate use of digital technologies in schools. In underserved areas, the role of teachers can be expected to include the promotion of students' access to and use of digital technologies, as well as the coordination of digital technologies for their instruction of all students (Salinas & Sánchez, 2009). Teachers should be able to coordinate students' learning experiences in schools, while protecting students' privacy, encouraging community engagement in education, and sustainably integrating instruction. In the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic, teachers’ roles as learning facilitators and enablers of online learning, or temporary emergency remote teaching (Bozkurt & Sharma, 2020), have been emphasized. High SDI schools have higher levels of student and teacher digital literacy, relative to medium and low SDI schools. These skills are fundamental to enabling and engaging in the information and knowledge society.

The low SDI schools (26.7%) had relatively low values for all indicators, compared to high and medium SDI schools. Schools in this group showed weak digital infrastructure, support for digital technology integration, and digital literacy compared to the other groups. Particularly, the values for school digital infrastructure were lower than the indicators related to school support for technology integration and school digital literacy. The relative weakness of digital infrastructure means that schools in the low SDI profile need to enhance school digital infrastructure for physical access, because physical access is a necessary condition for all the subsequent phases of using digital technologies (Van Dijk, 2020). A further consideration with low SDI schools is that students are likely to be more exposed to the digital divide than those in other profiles, and to remain at this status (Van Dijk, 2020). The quality of digital devices and access to the internet for educational purposes in schools can affect students’ opportunities to obtain digital skills, providing more usage opportunities with high-quality application by teachers and students. Further, school administrators should care about teacher support related to their use of digital technologies for instruction. Mostly, schools in the low SDI profile need their teachers and students to be aware of the importance of technology integration using school digital infrastructure, and to see its relevance (Zelezny-Green, Vosloo, & Conole, 2018). Finally, schools should provide support for teachers and students with poor digital skills.

5.2. Predictors of school digital inclusion profiles
In relation to the second RQ, we explored the predictors of distinct profiles of SDI with three socioeconomic factors, including ESCS and type of school. Our findings suggested that socioeconomic factors significantly predicted profiles of SDI. Digital inequality—in terms of access to and use of online information, communication, and the benefits of internet usage—is increasing between students from lower and higher socioeconomic backgrounds (Beaunoyer et al., 2020; Van Deursen, 2020). Three latent profiles of SDI could be differentiated by the predictors related to the socioeconomic gap. Using type of school as an alternative indicator of SES in schools, private schools were more likely to be in the high- and medium-level SDI profiles than the low-level one. Our findings are consistent with previous studies that found private schools to be more likely to use digital technologies for education, to have more digital devices for instruction in classrooms, and to be better equipped for digital inclusion than public schools (Gómez-Fernández & Mediavilla, 2019). Furthermore, ESCS was a strong predictor of distinct profiles of SDI, as we expected. Thus, our framework of SDI can differentiate among profiles using socioeconomic predictors.

5.3. Implications for practice
School education, which is in crisis under the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, appears to rely on advances in information and digital technology in many countries. However, degrees of SDI vary across schools, as identified in this study. A high level of SDI is of practical importance, particularly in this unprecedented time of hardship, for schools to continue making use of advanced technology for social inclusion. We will provide some recommendations for educators and policymakers to enhance SDI.

First, digital infrastructure, such as sufficient and powerful digital devices, and high-speed internet access are prerequisites. Many educational software programs are freely available, but some software for advanced experiences and special needs should be purchased. Thus, the additional cost for software programs should be included in school budgets. In addition, learning management systems for teachers and students to communicate and share educational resources beyond class hours will contribute to quality instruction.

Second, teachers' confidence in using digital technology and their instructional competence are important. For example, teachers should be able to teach on both a one-to-one and one-to-many basis. Digital technology will enable teachers to identify students' personal needs and tutor them. To that end, professional development for the purpose of technology integration should be provided to meet teachers’ professional needs.

Third, the digital skills of both teachers and students determine the extent of digital usage for teaching and learning. Therefore, digital skill formation and development should be planned for a long-term period, and should be incorporated into school curricula for appropriate ICT application in education. Especially for students, frequent use of digital technology and an encouraging climate at home have a positive and significant influence on their digital skills. Thus, students with poor digital skills and literacy can be identified through surveys or observations, and it is necessary to devise adequate intervention programs targeting digitally disadvantaged students.

Once schools are digitally inclusive, it will be possible for them to reach out to community and family members using digital technology (Hohlfeld et al., 2010). Finally, it is notable that school leadership is a very important driver of school digital inclusivity, as it provides teachers and students with a good educational environment and high-quality infrastructure, with a clear vision in mind (Gerick, 2018). At a macro level, educational policymakers should implement affirmative actions to alleviate inequality in SDI, such as increasing financial support for and concentrating digitally competent teachers in disadvantaged schools.

Several limitations of this study are worth considering when interpreting our results. First, the self-reported data from principals and students could not accurately capture the actual infrastructure, support, and digital literacy levels of participating schools. Second, we used cross-sectional data collected through stratified sampling in PISA 2018, without random sampling. Third, in the COVID-19 era with its frequent, recurring, and long-lasting school closures, it is the access to computers and a high-quality broadband internet connection in students' homes that is of special importance. Thus, the conclusions drawn from this study that deals with the quality of digital equipment in schools might be presently of limited practical value.

6. Conclusion
In conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of SDI profiles and their associations with socioeconomic factors. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of patterns of digital inclusion among schools, as well as support to enhance digital inclusion for students. The lack of digital infrastructure in schools in underserved areas is a serious challenge to students’ learning continuity and teacher support. However, the school components necessary to digitally connect and support all students together have not yet been determined. Our findings suggest that it is important to differently approach the policies to enhance school environments and dynamics in order to address overall digital inclusion.
