Tablets are increasingly being used in classrooms, yet we know little about how students perceive instruction with tablets. Student perceptions come from the perspective of the learner and can reveal how technology-based teaching affects different learners. Using student ratings of supportive climate can show how supportive students perceive instruction with tablets and can begin to indicate effective integration of technology into the classroom. However, students' perceptions can vary within classrooms depending on their learning characteristics, suggesting distinct subgroups of students may perceive instruction with tablets in meaningfully different ways. The present study employs latent profile analysis to investigate differences in secondary students' perceptions depending on cognitive and motivational characteristics in classes with and without tablets (N =1,058). Results indicate unmotivated and struggling students perceive more supportive climate in classes with tablets than the corresponding profiles perceiving instruction in classes without tablets. Furthermore, while students' perceptions seem to fall over time in classes that did not work with tablets, students' perceptions in classes with tablets remain more stable. Investigating both students' characteristics and their perceptions of supportive climate shows how different types of students are affected by the addition of tablets to the classroom.

1. Introduction
The use of technology as educational tools for teaching and learning in classrooms has been identified and emphasized as a significant priority across OECD countries (OECD, 2015). Particularly in Germany that has fallen behind other OECD countries in implementing technology into the classroom (Gerick, Eickelmann, & Bos, 2017), increasingly more schools are being equipped for the first time with personal, mobile devices such as tablets towards the aim of improving teaching and learning processes in the classroom (Sekretariat der Ständigen Konferenz der Kultusminister der Länder in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland [KMK], 2016). However, the addition of tablets represents a significant change in German classrooms, prompting the question how students initially perceive the shift in their educational setting. In turn, these perceptions can better inform how the use of tablets could impact students’ learning processes and learning outcomes.

Previous research indicates how students perceive their educational setting and especially whether they perceive it as supportive can be powerful predictors of student motivation as well as a requirement for learning gains (e.g., Baumert et al., 2010; Klieme, Pauli, & Reusser, 2009; Pianta & Hamre, 2009). Yet, even in countries where digital media is regularly used in the classroom, there is still a lack of empirical evidence regarding how students perceive the changes accompanied by the use of mobile devices. Instead research has tended to focus on the relation between the use of educational technologies and gains in student achievement, such as knowledge acquisition and test scores (e.g., Lai & Bower, 2020; Sung, Chang, & Liu, 2016). In order to overcome this gap, we investigate students’ perceptions of supportive climate when tablets are introduced and to what extent students in classes with tablets perceive instruction as supportive compared to students in classes without tablets.

Additionally, we follow the position by Kozma (1991) suggesting that media per se will not make a difference for learning; rather, the impact depends on the educational context as well as the particular learning characteristics of the students. This is in line with a long tradition of teaching research showing individual learning prerequisites including cognitive and motivational-affective components are among the most important determinants of successful learning processes (Snow, Corno, & Jackson, 1996). Furthermore, not only learning processes and learning outcomes are influenced by cognitive and motivational-affective learning prerequisites, also how students perceive the same educational setting is systematically linked to their learning prerequisites (Seidel, 2006). Therefore, we investigate for whom instruction with tablets makes a difference. To do so, we investigate differences in students’ perceptions depending on their individual learning prerequisites. Further, we analyze whether these perceptions change for students with different learning prerequisites before and after tablets are introduced.

1.1. The use of technology in German classrooms
Although Germany has a highly developed education system, technology use for educational purposes has not been as pervasive as in other OECD countries (Gerick et al., 2017). Results from the first International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) conducted in 2013 indicated in Germany that less than a third (31.4%) of eighth-graders stated that they used computers in class at least once a week and that all other eighth-graders used digital media in school less often or not at all (Eickelmann, Schaumburg, Drossel & Lorenz, 2014). Following these results, in 2016 the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs decided on a national strategy to improve digital infrastructure in schools (Gerick et al., 2017). However, the most recent ICILS conducted in 2018, before the joint national strategy went into effect, indicate that schools in Germany continue to lag in international comparisons. The ICILS 2018 showed only a quarter of the students in Germany attended a school where teachers and students have access to Wi-Fi compared to 64 percent internationally. Additionally, in Germany there are ten students per computer provided by the school, although this is still above the international average of 15 students per computer. Furthermore, Germany is the only country where frequency of using technology in school is significantly negatively correlated with computer and information literacy (Drossel, Eickelmann, Schaumburg, & Labusch, 2019). However, the situation in Germany presents a unique opportunity. Since digital media is not presently part of everyday teaching, Germany offers a suitable research context to investigate whether the use of digital media can have a positive impact on learning, starting with whether adding digital media to the classroom changes how students perceive instruction. In turn, students’ perceptions are important determinants for learning success with tablets.

1.2. Students’ perceptions of supportive climate
Students' perceptions are widely used to gain unique insight into the educational setting and have been found to be powerful predictors of student learning outcomes (Fauth, Decristan, Rieser, Klieme, & Büttner, 2014, Göllner, Wagner, Eccles, & Trautwein, 2018). For example, Göllner et al. (2018) showed that secondary education students with more positive perceptions of their teacher's instructional practices had higher math achievement, a better math grade, more math enjoyment, and greater experienced competences in math. Shuell (1996) describes the ways in which students perceive the instructional environment is more important in determining what the student will learn than the actions of the teacher. Göllner et al. (2018) explain this in line with the conception of learning activities as an offer that must be perceived and utilized by students in order for learning to take place (e.g., Creemers, Kyriakides, & Antoniou, 2013). In this way, students' idiosyncratic perceptions mediate the effect that an instructional practice will have on individual students' development (Den Brok, Fisher, Rickards, & Bull, 2006). Altogether, students' subjective perceptions of their educational settings matter for learning. Given this importance, investigating how students perceive their educational settings when learning activities take place with tablets can further elucidate what actually happens in classrooms when tablets are introduced and in which ways tablets may affect students' learning processes.

In particular, we examine how students perceive being supported by their educational setting. A supportive climate is considered an essential aspect of high-quality instruction and has consistently been shown to be a valid indicator for learning success (e.g., Klieme et al., 2009; Pianta & Hamre, 2009). Research shows students' perceptions of support is linked to their motivational development (Klieme et al., 2009) and is negatively related to emotions such as anxiety and boredom (Lazarides & Bucholz, 2019). Perceiving support is characterized by experiencing “supportive teacher-student relationships, positive and constructive teacher feedback, a positive approach to students’ errors and misconceptions, individual learner support, and caring teacher behavior” (Klieme et al., 2009, p. 141). In turn, students perceiving support is a necessary precondition for them to engage in insightful learning processes and more challenging tasks (Baumert et al., 2010).

Although supportive climate has been linked to the positive development of student motivation in traditional educational settings (Klieme et al., 2009), it may be even more important in less familiar educational settings with tablets. Providing mobile devices to every student allows more opportunities for learning activities in which students’ roles can change from passive recipients of information to active participants in constructing and sharing knowledge (Montrieux, Raes, & Schellens, 2017; Pelgrum, 2001). Although student-oriented practices are generally considered to be beneficial for student learning (e.g., OECD, 2015), whether students perceive this shift positively may also depend on how teachers support them to use the technology. In one study by Montrieux et al. (2017), secondary students were divided into varying conditions of inquiry-based learning with tablets. Results showed students strongly preferred the traditional approach of listening to their teacher because they were not accustomed to being actively involved throughout the entire course and being responsible to use tablets in an autonomous way. While the use of technology can facilitate a shift from a teacher to a student-centered classroom, teachers still have the pivotal role of guiding students to use the technology (Montrieux et al., 2017). Furthermore, despite the potential of technology such as tablets to enable more innovative teaching and learning practices, they can be a radical change in the classroom, and students may need additional learning support and constructive or adaptive feedback to feel comfortable making mistakes and engage in more challenging learning tasks. Perceiving supportive climate may therefore by even more important in the new educational setting with tablets.

1.3. The influence of students’ learning prerequisites on perceptions
How students perceive their educational settings with tablets may not only depend on its particular implementation in the classroom, but also on students' individual learning prerequisites. Students' learning prerequisites can be understood as the skills, beliefs, and prior knowledge that students bring with them to the classroom that significantly influence how they interpret their educational settings as well as how they acquire new knowledge (Bransford, Brown, & Cocking, 2000). Previous research using student ratings have shown students can differ widely in their individual perceptions of the same instruction (Göllner et al., 2018; Schenke, 2018; Schenke, Ruzek, Lam, Karabenick, & Eccles, 2018). These idiosyncratic perceptions may indicate meaningful differences between how students with particular learning prerequisites perceive instruction. For example, Lazarides and Ittel (2012) found secondary education students who perceived high instructional quality were significantly more likely to have higher math interest and self-concept than students who perceived lower instructional quality. With respect to students' perceptions of the supportive conditions of their educational settings, student ratings have been systematically linked to students’ general cognitive ability, prior content knowledge, and subject-related interest and self-concept in physics instruction (Seidel, 2006). The author found students with high prior content knowledge, self-concept, and interest were most likely to perceive the same instruction as more supportive than students with overall more challenging characteristics, such as low cognitive ability or low interest, or students who underestimated their ability. These results indicate micro-learning environments within the same classroom for different students (Schweig, 2016; Seidel, 2006).

Furthermore, Seidel (2006) utilized a person-centered approach that classified students according to distinct learning prerequisites. These profiles demonstrated the importance of not only looking at students' cognitive abilities, such as their general cognitive abilities and their acquired knowledge in subject domains, but seeing them in combination with affective and motivational aspects, such as subject-specific self-concept and interest. In this vein, increasingly more research is showing not a single variable can explain students’ differing perceptions but rather a combination (Huber & Seidel, 2018). Huber and Seidel (2018) describe studies using person-centered approaches that find students who “are able but not confident, knowledgeable but not interested, or self-efficacious but only moderate achievers” (p. 1). Rather than students with overall uniform characteristics, such as high cognitive ability, high self-concept, and high motivation, studies find incoherence in the interplay of characteristics, such as students with high cognitive abilities but low motivation or high motivation and low cognitive abilities.

Emerging research is beginning to show students may also perceive learning with technology differently depending on learning prerequisites. Barkatsas, Kasimatas, and Gialamas (2009) found secondary students with low math confidence, affective and behavioral engagement, and achievement but high confidence with technology perceived learning math with technology more positively. Similarly, Salmela-Aro, Muokta, Alho, Hakkarainen, and Lonka (2016) found that sixth grade students who were cynical towards school, characterized by high levels of burnout, exhaustion, and feelings of inadequacy, reported they would be more academically engaged and hardworking if there was greater use of ICT in schools. However, less research is known on how students specifically perceive instruction with tablets.

In general, previous research shows secondary students appreciate tablets for being an ‘all-in-one’ device allowing them to instantly search additional information, take pictures and integrate notes, as well as spontaneously communicate with their teachers and peers. Students also value tablets for being easy to use, fast at accessing a variety of learning materials, and for replacing heavy textbooks (Montrieux, Vanderlinde, Schellens, & De Marez, 2015). Moreover, initial findings show positive effects on motivational-affective aspects of student learning when students start working with tablets. Burden, Hopkins, Male, Martin and Trala (2012) evaluated the effects of iPads in schools and identified personal ownership of a tablet as the most important factor in increasing motivation, promoting student autonomy, and encouraging students to take more responsibility for their own learning. Accordingly, mobile devices such as tablets have been shown to reinforce motivation or increase engagement (Sung, Chang, & Liu, 2016). This boost might be particularly important in secondary education when students may begin to lose interest in science compared to other subjects (Gaspard, Häfner, Parrisius, Trautwein, & Nagengast, 2017). Particularly in science classes, tablets along with other mobiles devices and applications are being used to increase students' engagement by enabling more interactive learning experiences (Ahmed & Parsons, 2013).

Besides these findings, tablets could also be used to improve how students perceive being supported in their educational settings. The availability of tablets provides more opportunities for teachers to offer ongoing feedback as well as collect cumulative assessment data (Goodwin, 2012). Tablets can also be used to enable computer-based feedback that can be employed in a targeted manner to provide adaptive feedback or to assign different tasks to students (Lachner, Burkhart, & Nückles, 2017). Additionally, communicating online enhanced students’ willingness to ask for help from their teacher because of a greater sense of anonymity and decreased intimidation by social cues (Bures, Abrami, & Amundsen, 2000). However, despite the capabilities of tablets to support students in their educational settings, previous research in traditional environments show students perceive supportive climate differently depending on their learning prerequisites (Seidel, 2006). Whether these differences persist in educational settings with tablets has not yet been investigated.

1.4. Overview on study and hypotheses
The present study investigated students' perceptions of supportive climate in biology classes comparing classrooms with and without tablets. A science domain was chosen because in general students’ motivation towards science has been shown to decrease over the course of schooling (Gaspard et al., 2017). However, the use of tablets has been shown particularly in science classes to increase learning engagement (Ahmed & Parsons, 2013). Whereas in traditional instruction, previous research showed students with more challenging learning prerequisites such as low interest and prior content knowledge perceived less support than students with more positive characteristics (Seidel, 2006), we were interested in how students with different learning prerequisites would perceive instruction with tablets. Rather than take a variable-centered approach that assumes a sample comes from a homogenous population, we adopted a person-centered approach based on the proposition that distinct subgroups of students may exist, and these distinct subgroups may perceive instruction with tablets in meaningfully different ways (Von Eye & Bogat, 2006). To this end, we followed the approach by Seidel (2006) and used latent profile analysis (LPA) to determine students with different profiles based on their individual learning prerequisites.

In a first step, we investigated whether different profiles of students could be identified in biology classes with and without tablets and whether these profiles differed in their perceptions of supportive climate, thereby attempting to replicate and extend prior findings by Seidel (2006). We expected there would be significant differences in both learning contexts across student perceptions depending on the profile (Hypothesis 1).

Second, we investigated whether these profile-dependent perceptions would differ between tablet and non-tablet classes. Against the backdrop of preliminary findings regarding students’ perceptions of instruction with technology (Barkatsas et al., 2009; Salmela-Aro et al., 2016), we expected especially students in profiles with more challenging learning prerequisites, such as low prior content knowledge and low self-concept, would have more positive perceptions in tablet than in non-tablet classes (Hypothesis 2).

Third, we investigated profile perceptions over time in tablet and non-tablet classes. On the one hand, findings by Montrieux et al. (2017) suggests students may feel overwhelmed with tablet-based instruction when first introduced into the classroom. On the other hand, over time positive effects on students' perceptions may become more visible when teachers and students become more familiar with the use of tablets for teaching and learning. In turn, students’ perceptions of instruction were generally expected to become more favorable over time in tablet classes as compared with non-tablet classes (Hypothesis 3). In addition, we explored whether these positive developments of perceptions within tablet (compared with non-tablet) classes would be especially true for students in profiles with more challenging learning prerequisites.

2. Method
2.1. Participants and procedure
Data was collected within a longitudinal project that investigates whether and under what conditions digital media enable successful teaching and learning processes in the classroom. The data stemmed from a school initiative which was funded by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Youth and Sports of Baden-Württemberg, with the aim to support schools in the effective use of digital media for teaching. All academic track schools across Baden-Württemberg were invited to apply and informed that select schools would be provided with a full class set of tablets for two classes. The Ministry then chose schools based on whether there was a concept for integrating digital media into their school and were able to provide the appropriate IT infrastructure and to ensure that schools across the four districts of the state would be represented in the study. In this way, schools came from both rural and urban regions. Following the selection process, under the conditions of the initiative set out by the Ministry, participating schools were randomly assigned to tablet and non-tablet groups, and schools then decided which two classes would participate. Furthermore, under the conditions set out by the Ministry, the teachers in tablet classes were asked to integrate tablets into their daily classroom practices, however, they were not enrolled in professional development programs or instructed how to use tablets in their classes. Participants included students and teachers who take part in questionnaires and tests at four points over the course of three years from grade 7 to grade 9. Parents were informed and asked to sign consent forms for their children to participate in the study, and ethical approval was obtained from the Ministry.

The sample of the current analysis include the first cohort of 1,058 biology students from 56 classes in 28 schools of the school initiative. Half of the classes received personal tablets (n = 518 students) while the other half did not (n = 540 students). The mean age of the female (48.2%) and male students was 13.31 years (SD = 0.53). Questionnaire and test data measuring student learning prerequisites was collected before students in the tablet classes received their personal tablets in February 2018, measurement point (t0), and again after four months of tablet use in July (t1). At t0, all students were asked to rate their perceptions of supportive climate regarding their general instruction. At t1, students in the tablet group were asked to separately rate their perception of supportive climate, first considering the instruction in which they had not worked with tablets and second, considering instruction in which they had worked with tablets. The latter ratings refer to on average nine times of use in their biology instruction (Frequency of using tablets, M = 8.86, SD = 6.40, Min = 0, Max = 20). With regard to the learning activities, students reported they mostly used tablets to present learning content such as with Powerpoint, to read from a digital textbook, for homework, and for editing partner and/or group work. At t1, students in the non-tablet group were only asked to rate their perception of supportive climate regarding general instruction.

Comparing students with different prerequisites across different contexts involving tablets has so far not been investigated. Although there are no existing methods to perform a power analysis, we feel confident the sample size is large enough to detect effects. To the best of our knowledge, we do not know of any study in this field investigating students’ perceptions of instruction with and without tablets that has a comparable sample size.

2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Profile indicators
Cognitive prerequisites were measured in two ways. General cognitive ability was assessed by a cognitive ability subtest on figure analogies (Heller & Perleth, 2000), which consisted of 25 items coded as correct or not (M = 18.29, SD = 5.40). As the acquisition of subject-specific knowledge is often measured by content-related achievement such as grades (Pielmeier, Huber, & Seidel, 2018), students' self-reported biology grades from the previous semester were used as an indicator of prior content knowledge (M = 2.47, SD = 0.86). In Germany, grades range from 1 to 6, with 1 being the best. Students' motivational-affective prerequisites were measured with two established scales based on Gaspard et al. (2017). Biology interest (e.g., ‘Biology is fun for me’; Cronbach's α = 0.94) and biology self-concept (e.g., ‘I am good in Biology; ’ Cronbach's α = 0.77) were each assessed with four items rated on a four-point scale ranging from 1 = strong disagree to 4 = strongly agree.

2.2.2. Supportive climate
Students' perceptions of supportive climate were measured with three subscales that have been widely used in large-scale assessments in Germany (e.g., Rakoczy, Buff, & Lipowsky, 2005). Constructive approach to errors contained four items based off Rakoczy et al. (2005; e.g., ‘Our teacher is patient when a student makes a mistake’; Cronbach's α = 0.85). Clarity in teaching was investigated with three items based off (Baumert et al., 2008; e.g., ‘Our teacher can explain things well’; Cronbach's α = 0.91). Lastly, interestingness and relevance was measured with three items based off Rakoczy et al., (2005; e.g., ‘Our teacher makes dry material interesting’; α = 0.89). All items were rated on a four-point scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 4 = strongly agree.

At both t0 and t1, students in tablet and non-tablet classes rated the supportive climate subscales referring to general instruction. Additionally, at t1, students in tablet classes rated the subscales once more referring to instruction with tablets. The subscales used the same item stems and only differed referring to the context. To verify the supportive climate subscales referring to classes with and without tablets would be comparable yet distinct constructs, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used. First, a CFA was conducted in which the supportive climate subscales with and without tablets were modelled as separate factors. Given the common wording stem of the items with and without tablets, it was expected there would be high correlations (Fauth et al., 2014). The correlation between constructive approach to errors without tablets and with tablets was 0.92, clarity in teaching was 0.91, and interestingness and relevance was 0.85. Although high, Wagner et al., (2013) showed correlations between different scales in the range of up to 0.96 behaved differently in empirical studies. Fit indices also indicated good model fit (RMSEA = 0.02, CFI = 0.99, TLI = 0.99, SRMR = 0.03). Additionally, a chi-square difference test showed the more restrictive model constraining the factor loadings to be equal versus the less restrictive model freely estimating the factor loadings did not result in lower model fit (χ2 (7) = 8.09, p > .05), indicating the equivalence of the measures.

In order to compare instruction with tablets in tablet classes and general instruction in non-tablet classes, a multiple-group CFA was used. The chi-square difference test showed constraining the factor loadings to be equal across groups did not result in lower model fit (χ2 (7) = 3.61, p > .05), suggesting that the constructs across groups were comparable.

2.3. Data analyses
All analyses were conducted using Mplus Muthén and Muthén (1998-2015). In the first step, we used the entire sample to determine the optimal number of latent classes by comparing statistical indices of models with increasing numbers of classes. Each time we added another class, we recorded the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), and the adjusted BIC (ABIC) for which smaller values indicate better model fit. Additionally, we used the Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio (LMR LR) test to look for significant p-values indicating a model with one more class fits the data better (Nylund, Asparouhov, & Muthén, 2007). Once the model with the optimal number of latent classes was chosen, we examined the quality of the latent class solution by looking at the posterior class-membership probability information. Students were assigned to the profile for which they had the greatest probability according to their observed response patterns. Probability values should be 0.80 or larger for a good class solution (Geiser, 2013). In addition, we looked at the class misclassification as measured by the entropy value. Entropy values should be 0.60 or higher to provide sufficiently good class separation (Asparouhov & Muthén, 2014). Finally, we defined the latent profiles according to the estimated class means of the observed variables in each of the classes. In doing so, we checked whether we could interpret the profiles substantively and whether they matched previous research and theory (Seidel, 2006). In this stage of the analysis, we used latent profile analysis to first determine whether students could be grouped into distinct profiles based on their cognitive and motivational-affective prerequisites as well as the optimal number of profiles.

Next, we used an automatic three-step approach to investigate the predictive validity of the latent classification on students’ perceptions of supportive climate. Asparouhov and Muthén (2014) showed the Bolck-Croon-Hagenaars (BCH) method outperformed all other three-step approaches predicting distal outcomes with a latent class model without distorting the class solution. Unlike other methods, the BCH method uses a weighted multiple group analysis to evaluate the means across profiles when including an auxiliary variable to avoid shifting the latent classes in the final stage (Bakk, Tekkle, & Vermunt, 2013). In the first step, the underlying latent class model was estimated using only the latent class indicator variables. Second, individuals were assigned to latent classes and saved as class specific weights. Third, the BCH method was used to estimate the profile-specific means of the supportive climate subscales considering instruction at t0 and again at t1. Chi-square tests were used to test for significant differences between the profiles. Additionally, in only the tablet classes, the BCH method was used to estimate the profile-specific means of the supportive climate subscales in classes with tablets at t1. Lastly, to take into account students were nested into classes, cluster-robust standard errors were used (McNeish, Stapleton, & Silverman, 2017). After having identified the optimal number of profiles in the previous stage, we aimed to determine whether the profiles differed in their perceptions of supportive climate in classes with and without tablets at all measurements points.

To test for significant differences in profile perceptions between the tablet and the non-tablet classes at t1, we used the manual three-step BCH approach. In the first step, we used school type as an additional independent variable in order to form the latent profiles in tablet classes and non-tablet classes and to save the BCH weights as before. However, in the second step, two weights were saved for each of the five profiles resulting in a total of 10 weights corresponding to the profiles in tablet and non-tablet classes. Subsequently in the third step, it was possible within a single analysis to estimate the profile specific-perceptions in the tablet and non-tablet classes and compute z-tests to test for significant differences between the corresponding profiles in the tablet and non-tablet classes. We estimated the profile-specific means of instruction with tablets in tablet classes and general instruction in non-tablet classes. To test for significant differences between the profiles, we created new parameters using the Model Constraint command for each difference in the profile-specific means and computed z-tests.

To test for significant differences in profile perceptions from t0 to t1 within tablet classes, we also used the manual BCH approach and in the first steps formed the latent classes and saved the BCH weights. Next, the profile-specific means of supportive climate considering general instruction at t0 and instruction with tablets at t1 were estimated. Additionally, the differences between each pair of profiles at t0 and t1 were computed. We followed the same procedure to test for significant differences over time within the non-tablet classes.

3. Results
3.1. Relation between profiles and perceptions (research question 1)
To test how profiles combining student prerequisites relate to student perceptions of supportive climate, in a first step we identified the student profiles. As the AIC, BIC, and the ABIC decreased with the addition of each class, we relied on the LMR LR test to narrow the selection of the number of classes. The p-value became insignificant with the addition of the sixth class, indicating no more significant improvement in model fit (See Appendix). Using the model output of the five-class solution, we examined the quality of the latent class membership classification. First, we looked at the posterior-class membership probability given the individuals’ response patterns on the observed items. We found values ranging from .79 to .87, indicating a high precision of the classification (see Table 1). Additionally, we compared the final class counts and proportions for the latent class patterns based on estimated posterior probabilities to the classification of individuals based on their most likely latent class membership. These values did not differ considerably and indicated an entropy value of 0.74.


Table 1. Profile descriptions, group size, number of students, and probability of expected class membership for the five latent profiles (N = 1058).

Label	Description	Number	Proportion	Probability of Expected Profile Membership
struggling	uniformly low values	93	8.79%	0.85
average	values similar to overall means	519	49.05%	0.79
unmotivated	low interest, self-concept, and content knowledge but high cognitive ability	154	14.56%	0.84
overestimating	high interest and self-concept but fairly low cognitive ability	74	7.00%	0.83
strong	uniformly high values	218	20.60%	0.87
Based on the LPA, five distinct profiles of student learning prerequisites were identified. The ‘unmotivated’ profile was characterized for having the lowest biology interest, low self-concept, and low prior content knowledge in biology yet high general cognitive ability (n = 154, 14.56%). Although these students underestimated their ability in biology, they actually had general cognitive abilities on par with the strongest profile. This combination of characteristics suggest these students have the cognitive ability to be high performing but may lack the motivation to perform better in class, as reflected by their low interest and grades. Students in the ‘average’ profile accounted for almost half of the participants (n = 519, 49.05%). This profile contained means closely resembling the overall average of the entire sample, except for slightly below average self-concept as well as slightly above average general cognitive ability. We found similar combinations of prerequisites as in Seidel (2006) for the remaining profiles and therefore refer to them using the same labels. Students in an ‘overestimating’ profile were characterized as having high interest and high self-concept, similar to the strongest profile, but below average general cognitive ability and average prior content knowledge (n = 74, 7.00%). Students in a ‘strong’ profile demonstrated overall high values on all characteristics including the highest values for interest and self-concept as well as prior content knowledge (n = 218, 20.60%). Lastly, students in a ‘struggling’ profile had below average means on all indicators (n = 93, 8.79%). Although these students had higher values in interest and self-concept than the ‘unmotivated’ profile, their general cognitive ability was far below the average (see Fig. 1). In addition to the entire sample, we followed the same procedure to identify the optimal number of profiles and to check the validity of the profile solution statistically and substantively using only the tablet classes and separately using only the non-tablet classes. We found the same set of profiles in both the non-tablet and the tablet classes.

Fig. 1. Standardized means of the profile indicators per profile. Note. To better illustrate the differences between the latent classes, the variables were centered and standardized to have a grand meal equal to zero and a standard deviation equal to one. Previous biology grade was used as a proxy for prior content knowledge and reverse coded so higher grades indicated more prior content knowledge.

After identifying the five-profile solution, we next looked at the relationship between the profiles and students' perceptions to see whether the profiles would differentially predict students' perceptions of supportive climate. We found in both non-tablet and tablet classes at t0 and t1 there were almost always significant differences between students’ perceptions of supportive climate depending on the profile (see Table 2). Struggling and unmotivated students perceived instruction significantly more negatively than overestimating and strong students. However, there were less significant differences between the perceptions of the strong and overestimating profiles, suggesting that students in the overestimating and strong profiles perceived supportive climate in similar ways. Additionally, in the non-tablet classes, there were no significant differences between the perceptions of the struggling and unmotivated profiles, whereas in the tablet classes, there were no significant differences between the perceptions of the struggling and average profiles. Furthermore, using only the tablet classes, we found significant differences between the profiles considering instruction with tablets (see Appendix). Although there were the same significant differences regarding interestingness and relevance, there were fewer significant differences regarding constructive approach to errors and clarity in teaching.

3.2. Differences across tablet and non-tablet classes (research question 2)
Using the manual BCH approach, in addition to estimating the latent class model and the profile-specific means of the supportive climate subscales in the non-tablet and tablet classes, we tested for significant differences between the respective profiles at t1 (after tablet classes already worked with tablets for four months). Tablet students in the average, unmotivated, and struggling profiles perceived instruction with tablets as significantly more supportive than non-tablet students in the same profiles perceiving instruction without tablets (see Table 4). Because there were significant differences at t0 between tablet and non-tablet classes in the struggling and the strong profiles regarding students’ perceptions across the three subscales, we also controlled for t0 when estimating the profile-specific means and testing for significant differences. After controlling for t0, we found significant differences between the tablet and non-tablet classes in the struggling and unmotivated profiles considering constructive approach to errors and clarity in teaching and significant differences in the average and unmotivated profile considering interestingness and relevance. Of these significant differences, the students in the tablet classes perceived the supportive climate subscales significantly more positively.

3.3. Differences over time (research question 3)
We estimated the profile-specific means of the supportive climate subscales considering instruction without tablets at t0 and instruction with tablets at t1 within the tablet classes and considering instruction without tablets at both t0 and t1 in the non-tablet classes. Within the non-tablet classes, profile perceptions of supportive climate generally decreased over time, and the average profile perceived interestingness and relevance significantly more negatively (see Table 5). However, within the tablet classes, perceptions remained more stable or increased over time, with the exception of the strong profile that perceived clarity in teaching and interestingness and relevance significantly more negatively (see Table 6). Notably, the unmotivated profile perceived interestingness and relevance significantly more positively over time.

4. Discussion
As more schools in Germany are being equipped with tablets, the present study begins to look at how students perceive this new educational setting using student ratings of supportive climate. Nevertheless, student ratings of the same instruction can differ depending on students' learning prerequisites. By looking at both students’ prerequisites and their perceptions of supportive climate, we can begin to understand how different types of students are affected by the addition of tablets to the classroom.

The first aim of the study was to check whether students could be grouped by their cognitive and motivational-affective prerequisites into distinct profiles and whether these profiles would function to predict students’ perceptions of supportive climate in both classes with and without tablets. We found the same set of profiles existed in the entire sample as well as for the two subsamples, non-tablet and tablet classes, speaking for the robustness of the five-profile solution and replicates the profiles found in Seidel (2006). Additionally, we found significant differences between student perceptions depending on the profile (e.g., struggling students perceived instruction significantly differently from overestimating students), and profiles predicted perceptions in the same way at both measurement points and within the two groups (e.g., strong students perceived instruction more positively in all conditions). Taken together, students differ depending on their learning prerequisites, and these differences matter for how they perceive supportive climate when they learn with and without tablets.

After showing the differential predictions of the five-profile solution, we compared the differences between profile perceptions in tablet and non-tablet classes. At t1, there were significant differences with the struggling, unmotivated, and average profiles perceiving instruction with tablets significantly more positively than students with the same profiles in non-tablet classes perceiving general instruction. Additionally, there were almost no significant differences between the overestimating and strong profiles in the tablet and non-tablet classes. However, there was one notable exception. Tablet students in the overestimating profile had significantly more positive perceptions of interestingness and relevance in instruction with tablets than students from the non-tablet classes in the same profile. A possible explanation could be that in line with previous research (e.g., Sung et al., 2016), tablets did have an engaging effect and even overestimating students perceived instruction to be more interesting and relevant with the addition of tablets. On the other hand, students in the strong profile who already perceived instruction positively and have higher cognitive ability compared to the overestimating profile, may have been disappointed by the actual use of tablets in classes, as reported by other students in 1:1 tablet schools (Blikstad-Balas & Davies, 2017). According to surveys and interviews, secondary education students in Norway, Denmark, and the UK were either disappointed that the use of tablets in class did not amount to much or because the effort to use them felt forced. This could also be in line with Ninaus, Moeller, McMullen, and Killi (2017) which found students with already high math interest and intrinsic motivation as well as high prior content knowledge did not benefit from the engaging nature of a digital math game. For teachers, this is an indication that the students who may typically perceive instruction to be supportive may not positively perceive the changes that accompany the addition of tablets to the classroom. Based on this, it would be important for teachers not to assume that the addition of digital media to the classroom has an overall positive effect.

In addition to investigating the differences between tablet and non-tablet classes at t1, we further analyzed the differences in the perception of supportive climate within tablet classes over time. Unlike in the non-tablet classes where students' perceptions mainly fell from t0 to t1, perceptions in the tablet classes remained mostly stable or increased, with the exception of the strong profile where perceptions actually decreased. Besides the possibility that strong students may have been disappointed by the use of tablets in class, a possible explanation for why the strong profile, unlike the other profiles in the tablet classes, perceived instruction with tablets more negatively could be that these students were already content with their instruction as evidenced by their high perceptions and did not want to change their educational setting. Compared to the non-tablet classes, our results suggest that the addition of tablets to the classroom may cushion students’ decline in perceptions of supportive climate over time. However, it must be noted that only the addition of tablets was examined in the study. Whether the quality of instruction with tablets could have differential and/or positive effects also on the perception of the strong students must be shown with further analyses.

While the results seem promising for the use of tablets in classrooms, there are several limitations. First, while schools were randomly assigned into tablet and non-tablet conditions, based on the design of the project by the ministry, schools decided which two classes would participate in the project. This could explain why there were differences across the profiles in students' perceptions of supportive climate at t0 between tablet and non-tablet classes. To account for these initial differences, we controlled for students' perceptions at t0 when calculating the differences across corresponding profiles at t1. However, comparing and interpreting the change over time between tablet and non-tablet classes must be done carefully considering the initial differences. Additionally, this study can only show whether students' perceptions of supportive climate change with the addition of tablets to the classroom, not whether instructional practices change. Based on these analyses, we cannot explain why struggling and unmotivated students perceive instruction to be more supportive in classes with tablets. Therefore, in future research, greater attention must be paid to investigate what actually happens in classrooms and how tablets are used (for example by analyzing teaching artefacts or video recordings). Furthermore, while we found significant differences between tablet and non-tablet classes after four months of tablet use considering all three supportive climate subscales, longitudinal studies have to analyze whether students' perceptions of supportive climate when learning with tablets stay stable or increase over time, or whether this initial finding is still a novelty effect. These analyses should also take into account the different ways teachers use tablets in their instruction and link these practices to students’ learning processes. Future research should also be directed at how to best measure the impact of tablets, whether it be with student ratings, changes in grades or test scores, or new instruments that could capture other skills students may learn as a result of using tablets, such as the abilities to work independently and locate and use Internet resources (Zheng et al., 2016).

5. Conclusions
Using student ratings of supportive climate and linking them to student prerequisites can already begin to show that using tablets may differentially benefit certain types of students and change the way they feel supported by their educational setting. In particular, students who were characterized as having low interest and self-concept along with low grades in biology class perceived supportive climate more positively with the addition of tablets, which has positive implications for their motivation and learning outcomes. This result seems promising moving forward that for students who may struggle in traditional educational settings, tablets may make a difference. Understanding that not all students will perceive and learn with tablets in the same way has important implications for teachers’ use of digital media in the classroom as well as researchers investigating how digital media facilitates student learning.
