Mobile phones have become an indispensable tool in different areas of life, however this often results in some negative effects, especially among their youngest users. The aim of the present study is to analyze the relationship between social anxiety and social skills via problematic smartphone use (PSU) for predicting somatic symptoms and academic performance. A total of N = 427 primary school students aged from 10 to 14 participated in the study and the following tools were used: the Smartphone Addiction Scale, the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale for Children and Adolescents, the Children's Self-Report Social Skills Scale, the Children's Somatization Inventory, and reported grade point average (GPA). The study showed that girls use smartphone applications such as talking, text messages, social networking, camera and organizer more often than boys. Our results showed a positive relationship between social skills and GPA, whereas PSU was negatively associated with GPA. Additionally, there was a positive relationship between social anxiety: avoidance and somatization. Social anxiety: fear was positively associated with GPA, whereas social anxiety: avoidance was negatively associated with GPA. In girls group there was a partial mediation between social skills and GPA via PSU, whereas in boys group there was a partial mediation between social skills and somatization via PSU.

1. Introduction
The young generation, referred to as the post-millennium generation or Generation Z, uses new digital technologies every day (Dimock, 2019). The virtual world is frequently the place where they carry out their development tasks (Borca et al., 2015). It is also where they feel free and are able to use the available applications conveniently (Purcell, 2012). Furthermore, the age of first-time users of mobile phones and the Internet is lowering (Smith & Anderson, 2018), and, more importantly, young people often gain their online experience without sufficient parental control (Jiang, 2018). In this respect the mobile phone with permanent access to the Internet plays an important role. Mobile phones have become an indispensable tool in such areas as communication, entertainment and education.1 Such a wide and common use of mobile phones has also some negative effects, especially among their youngest users. The phenomenon of problematic smartphone use (PSU) among children and adolescents is more and more common (Lopez-Fernandez et al., 2014). In the scientific literature, problematic smartphone (mobile phone) use is also referred to as an addiction, excessive use, compulsive use, and compensatory use, overuse (Elhai et al., 2017; Davey & Davey, 2014; De-Sola Gutiérrez et al., 2016; Mahmoodi et al., 2018; Sohn et al., 2019). Panova and Carbonell (2018), in their meta-analysis of research on the subject, point out that, in most cases, symptoms from the full spectrum of addiction do not occur, therefore, it would be more reasonable to use the term “problematic smartphone use” (PSU) than “addiction”. The latter may readily suggest the need for treatment, whereas “problematic smartphone use” is less stigmatizing, but it still recognizes the need both for therapeutic and preventive actions (Lopez-Fernandez et al., 2014; Elhai et al., 2017; Panova & Carbonell, 2018). Given the above facts, in the present paper, the phenomenon is referred to as PSU. Problematic smartphone use is observable in situations when users stay away from their mobile phones or receive no mobile notifications and, consequently, they feel anxiety, depression and disturbing physical symptoms (Cheever et al., 2014; Clayton et al., 2015; De-Sola Gutiérrez et al., 2016; Stiglic & Viner, 2019; Kruger & Djerf, 2016; Alosaimi et al., 2016; Elhai et al., 2017). The World Health Organization (2013) points to the scale and gravity of the problem. As observed in the study performed on a Polish group by the Centre for Public Opinion Research (CBOS) (Bożewicz & Omyła-Rudzka, 2018), smartphone overuse is most frequently associated with younger users. More and more often children become owners of mobile phones much earlier than before, and they use them for various purposes (Johnson, 2020). Usually, their phones have permanent access to the Internet and thus they can use various applications.

PSU is understood as compulsive mobile phone usage (Davey & Davey, 2014; De-Sola Gutiérrez et al., 2016). Its symptoms include, among others, uncontrolled mobile phone use, conscious use of mobile phones in dangerous situations or in situations when it is prohibited; family problems and problems with friends, as well as loss of interest in other activities; problems with controlled mobile phone use and difficulties in ceasing to use mobile phones (Billieux et al., 2008; Lopez-Fernandez et al., 2014). The studies carried out in Poland by Pawłowska and Potembska (2011) show that 3% of the adolescents aged between 13 and 24 complied with the criteria of mobile phone addiction, whereas 35% of the analyzed group was in the risk group.

The present study analyzed the relationship between social skills, social anxiety, somatization and academic performance via PSU as a mediator for these dependencies. Taking into account the fact that mobile phones are most often used for communication with other people, the uses and gratification theory was applied as the theoretical basis for the conducted studies (Rugerrio, 2000). A classic version of the uses and gratification theory assumes an active role of the receiver and selectiveness of mass media, in order to achieve gratification of particular needs. In this approach, the impact of the mass media depends on the subjective intentions of the sender (first movement) or the subjective intentions (and traits) of users (second movement). The present study used the second approach as the theoretical framework for the analyzed domains. The reference to this theory is even more justified as it has previously been used to analyze the issue of mobile phones (Park & Park, 2014).

1.1. Social anxiety, social skills and problematic smartphone use
Social skills facilitate an effective interaction with the surrounding world, they enable people to achieve social and individual aims and, at the same time, maintain good relations with partners of such interactions (White, 1959). Social skills are expressed by particular behaviors which indicate how the acquired knowledge and abilities are used according to the actual social situation (Skarżyńska, 1981). They ensure the use of the knowledge gained in one's lifetime and they are conditioned by personality traits, temperament, as well as general, social and emotional intelligence (Matczak, 2001). In the case of social anxiety the key elements include fear of negative evaluation and stress, and avoidance of new situations or majority of situations of social exposure (Winton et al., 1995). Social anxiety was negatively related to academic achievement (Brook & Willoughby, 2015). Individuals with high social anxiety used social support to a smaller extent (Urani et al., 2003), they also achieved lower academic results and were more at risk of premature withdrawal from school (Van Ameringen et al., 2003). Longitudinal studies (Nordstrom et al., 2014) showed that students with high social anxiety obtained higher scores in somatization, obsessive-compulsive disorders and they exhibited more symptoms of depression, general fear and phobias than their peers with low social anxiety. In the case of social skills the studies show that somatic problems such as headache, stomachache, dizziness and lethargy are more frequently reported by individuals who have difficulties with naming their emotions and who experience stronger emotional distress (Karkhanis & Winsler, 2016). The studies using a three-wave longitudinal design showed that children with lower social competence at the age of 4 experienced more psychosomatic symptoms in their adolescence (Bornstein et al., 2010). Moreover, social competence was significantly related to functioning at school at different levels, both at the social level and academic performance (Wentzel, 1991).

A group that is particularly prone to smartphone addiction are young people with emotional problems, low self-esteem and looking for friendship, as well as those who have problems with interpersonal relations, and therefore display low social competence ((Nęcka, 2003, Woronowicz, 2009)). Goetz (2014) emphasizes the role of personality factors in the development of smartphone or Internet addiction. Some of them include low self-esteem, shyness, low sense of agency, feeling of being undervalued which all lead to a person's escape into the seemingly safe world of the Internet and impoverishment of direct personal contacts. In turn, this may result in further withdrawal from social contacts and depression.

Many studies have found a relation between excessive use of mobile phones with fear, depression and stress (Ha et al., 2007; Panova & Lleras, 2016). These studies suggest that people displaying symptoms of social anxiety prefer using mobile phones for text-based asynchronous communication because this can alleviate fears associated with direct and synchronous interactions (Park et al., 2010; Reid & Reid, 2007), hence potentially contributing to problematic use. It has also been suggested that the preference for text-based asynchronous communication (often favored by Generation Z) may exacerbate disturbing social behaviors since physical cues vital for social interactions are not present during such interactions, and the possibilities of developing social confidence and social competence are limited (EnezDarcin et al., 2016; Panova & Lleras, 2016). Scott et al. (2016) showed that mobile phone overuse was related to lowered social skills, lower emotional intelligence and an increased number of interpersonal conflicts.

1.2. Effects of problematic smartphone use
Studies have shown a relation between time spent on mobile phone screens and health problems such as adiposity, unhealthy diet, depressive symptoms and the quality of life of children and adolescents (Stiglic & Viner, 2019). Interestingly, parents' phubbing2 may lead to adolescents’ mobile phone addiction (Xie et al., 2019). An excessive use of mobile phones may have some negative effects on the physical sphere – causing aches and pains and difficulties with concentration, lead to deeper depression, sleep disorders, poorer life satisfaction, as well as affect academic achievement (Alosaimi et al., 2016; Carson et al., 2016) and the social sphere (e.g. Panova & Lleras, 2016; Takao et al., 2009).

Negative effects of PSU include health problems, mental and social disorders and problems at work, as well as insomnia and sleeping problems. Studies show that people who use their phones in bed or 1 h before going to bed have problems with falling asleep and also (LeBlanc & Chaput, 2017; Wood et al., 2013; Bowler & Bourke, 2019). It is because blue light emitted from mobile phone and tablet screens suppresses melatonin secretion, what, in turn, results in delayed sleep as well as in worsened quality of sleep (Bowler & Bourke, 2019; Wood et al., 2013). Moreover, young people who use their mobile phones excessively more often experience restlessness, stress and fatigue (Goswami & Singh, 2016).

Studies have also shown that a negative pattern of mobile phone usage may translate into poorer academic performance (Alosaimi et al., 2016). Studies performed on a group of undergraduate students proved that students who are prone to smartphone addiction were less likely to achieve a distinctive academic performance (Hawi & Rupert, 2016). Higher duration of screen time was associated with more sedentary behaviors, which translated into body weight, lower self-esteem and academic achievement (Carson et al., 2016). Studies have shown that the effects of using devices with screens, including mobile phones, depend on the activity undertaken on the screen. For example, playing shooting games can be beneficial for cognitive processes such as visual processing, attention, or spatial processing (Granic et al., 2014). Furthermore, there are also games which enhance physical activity, for example Pokémon Go (LeBlanc & Chaput, 2017). This is a mobile game that connects the Pokémon world through augumented reality with the real world, requiring the players to physically move around. Due to its popularity and large scale of use of this application, this game is seen an example of intervention to encourage physical activity (Perez, 2016).

1.3. Gender differences in problematic smartphone use
The literature on the subject refers to gender differences in problematic smartphone use, however, the findings are frequently incoherent. Most of the studies have proved that a negative pattern of phone usage is more likely to be observed in male groups. Studies on a group of students have pointed to higher likelihood in the case of men, but, there are also differences in the patterns between women and men as regards the obtained dependencies (Chen et al., 2017). A systematic review has shown that girls aged 12–13 display a greater tendency to problematic smartphone use than boys (Fischer-Grote et al., 2019). Studies increasingly reveal that not only is PSU more frequent among girls, but it also has a stronger impact on the overall functioning of women compared to men. It concerns, in particular, an incorrect self-esteem, dissatisfaction with one's appearance or problems in the proper regulation of emotions (Lo Coco et al., 2020). It has been shown that girls use their phones as a tool for communication, maintaining peer-groups and contacts, spending time on social media or text messaging, while boys for their own sake as well as exploring its features and searching the Internet, video gaming and media sharing (Goswami & Singh, 2016; Cocoradă et al., 2018).

1.4. The present study
The main aim of this study is to show a relation between social anxiety, social skills via problematic smartphone use for predicting somatic symptoms and academic performance. The study included young people from the generation referred to as always on or iGen (Twenge, 2017), for whom using screen tools comes naturally. Based on the literature on PSU and its predictors, we have developed the research model (see Fig. 1). The literature indicates that digital media use, including smartphone use, cannot be explained without considering social functioning and its relation to our health (Naslund et al., 2020). However, there is still no coherent model that would link the variables at the level of social functioning with health functioning and academic performance. Such studies are rarely conducted, especially in relation to the group of primary school students. Even if some of these variables are taken into account, their influence turns out to be inconclusive in various studies. For example, some studies consider social skills as a protective factor against PSU (Lee & Lee, 2017; Fu et al., 2020), whereas others see them as conducive to the exacerbation of PSU symptoms (Chen, 2018). Therefore we decided to incorporate social skills and social anxiety into our model. Additionally, previous studies have shown that social life is connected with the excessive use of phones (Woronowicz, 2009; Scott et al., 2016), which may lead to somatic problems (somatization) (Carson et al., 2016) or result in poorer academic performance (Alosaimi et al., 2016). Under the term “somatization” we understand a tendency to experience somatic symptoms resulting from psychological stress as well searching medical help because of it (Lipowski, 1988; VanDriel et al., 2018). On the basis of previous research, the following hypotheses are made: PSU is positively associated with social anxiety (H1), social skills (H2) and somatic symptoms (H3), and negatively associated with academic performance (H4). It is also hypothesized that PSU functions as a mediator in relations between social anxiety and somatic symptoms (H5), between social skills and somatic symptoms (H6), social anxiety and academic performance (H7) and also social skills and academic performance (H8).

2. Method
2.1. Sample
A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out in Polish primary schools in four voivodeships: lubelskie, mazowieckie, pomorskie and wielkopolskie, which are not diverse in terms of ethnicity, language, inhabitants and education. The study was carried out by N = 439 primary school students, however twelve individuals were removed from further analyses due to incomplete data. Consequently, the sample consisted of N = 427 individuals aged from 10 to 14 (M = 13.06, SD = 1.09), where 218 of the participants were girls. The study was conducted with the consent of parents and legal guardians and it got the approval of the Ethics Committee of the University. From each voivodeship one school was randomly selected and the study was carried out in selected classes. It was anonymous, respected privacy of participants and it was performed in the presence of a teacher during a homeroom lesson. Before the procedure started, trained interviewers read the instruction and the informed consent form to students and they stated that the procedure would be performed with a pencil and paper. Participation was voluntary and there was no monetary reward for it. The only condition was to have own mobile phone with the Internet access.

2.2. Measures
The questionnaire for adolescents included such items as age, sex, nationality and school level. Students also answered questions about functions of their phones which they use, for example: calling, texting, the Internet (search engine, e-mail, social media and games), calendar, planning, listening to music and taking photos (Krzyżak-Szymańska, 2016). Additionally, they were asked to provide the average grade for all subjects in the last school year, which is included on the final diploma and indicates their academic achievements in a given school year. It is a well-established and reliable measure applied in a group of students (e.g. Brännlund & Edlund, 2020). The study was carried out with standardized research tools which had good psychometric properties. These measures were already used in the adolescent and young adult samples and provided reliable results (Brouzos et al., 2019; Ellis et al., 2019; Thorgaard et al., 2017). Furthermore, they were chosen because of their brevity and comprehension to be used among students in primary schools.

The Smartphone Addiction Scale (Kwon et al., 2013) – in its Polish adaptation by Authors (2020), contains 10 items (e.g. The people around me tell me that I use my smartphone too much; Feeling impatient and fretful when I am not holding my smartphone). The respondents rate their opinion on a 6-points scale, where 1 means I strongly disagree, 2 = I disagree, 3 = I rather disagree, 4 = I agree, 5 = I don't agree, 6 = I strongly agree. The scale demonstrated good psychometric properties, with Cronbach's alpha of 0.83 in this study.

The Children's Self-Report Social Skills Scale (Danielson & Phelps, 2003) is a 21- item instrument used to measure children's perspectives on their own social skills (e.g. I do not play fairly; I share games and toys with others). Each item is rated on a 5-point rating scale (1 = never, 2 = hardly ever, 3 = sometimes, 4 = most of the time, 5 = always), where a higher score reflects a higher level of social skills. Cronbach's alpha for the scale was 0.79 in this study.

The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale for Children and Adolescents (LSAS-CA-SR) (Shachar et al., 2014) consists of 24 items (e.g. Reading out loud in class; Writing on the chalkboard or in front of others) rated on a 4-point rating scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Out of 24 questions 12 items describe social interaction situations and the other 12 describe performance situations. Each item assesses the fear level and the avoidance level using a Likert type scale: fear (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) and avoidance (0 = never, 1 = occasionally, 2 = often, 3 = usually). In the present study two subscales were used: total fear and total avoidance. Both subscales demonstrated good psychometric properties. In this study Cronbach's alpha for anxiety was 0.91, while for avoidance it was 0.88.

The Children's Somatization Inventory (CSI-24) (Walker et al., 2009) is used to assess the perception of 24 specific somatic symptoms in children (e.g. headache, pain – lower back). The items are rated on a 5-point rating scale (0 = not at all, 1 = a little, 2 = somewhat, 3 = a lot, and 4 = a whole lot), reflecting the extent to which the symptoms were experienced in the past 2 weeks. Higher scores reflect higher levels of somatic symptoms. The questionnaire assesses the presence and frequency of somatic symptoms in children and adolescents. The scale demonstrated good psychometric properties, with Cronbach's alpha of 0.91 in this study.

2.3. Data analysis
The Mann-Whitney two-sample test was used to assess the differences between girls and boys as regards the frequency of use of different applications on the smartphone. Descriptive statistics (means (M), median (Me), standard deviations (SD), quartile deviation (Q)) were presented for girls and boys. The effect size was measured by η2 (Fritz et al., 2012).

Descriptive statistics (arithmetic means and standard deviations) of problematic smartphone use, social anxiety: fear, social anxiety: avoidance, social skills, somatization and grade point average were presented separately for girls and boys sample. Additionally, Pearson's correlation coefficient was applied to determine relationships between the variables separately for girls and boys sample.

In order to assess the differences between girls and boys group, the independent samples t-tests to compare mean differences were performed. The Cochran-Cox adjustment (Cochran & Cox, 1957) was used in cases where variances between the groups were heterogeneous. The magnitude of differences was measured as Cohen's d effect size and interpreted in accordance with Cohen’s (1988) guidelines: small d = 0.2, moderate d = 0.5, and large d = 0.8.

In order to examine the mediation effect between social skills and somatization via problematic smartphone use, as well as between social anxiety and somatization via problematic smartphone use, an analysis of structural equations was conducted using the maximum likelihood method. Moreover, this analysis was used to test the mediation effect between social skills and grade point average via problematic smartphone use as well as between social anxiety and grade point average via problematic smartphone use. The model also included covariance between social anxiety and social skills.

The model fit was assessed by following statistics: χ,2 χ2/df, CFI (comparative fit index), TLI (Tucker–Lewis index), RMSEA (root-mean-square error of approximation) and SRMR (standardized root-mean-square residual), (Hu & Bentler, 1999; Kline, 2011). If the χ2 value is statistically insignificant (p > 0.05) χ2, it may allow to draw the conclusion that the model is good fit to the dataset. Also, the χ2/df ratio lower than 2 may lead to the conclusion that the proposed model fits the dataset well. If values of RMSEA and SRMR are lower than 0.08, it may demonstrate a good fit of the model. Also, values of CFI and TLI higher than 0.90 may lead to the conclusion that the model fits the dataset well (Hu & Bentler, 1999; Kline, 2011). Additionally, the bootstrapping method (5000 sample) with the bias-corrected percentile method was used to estimate regression weights, correlations, R-squared value and indirect effect with 95% confidence interval (Bowler & Bourke, 2019; Kline, 2011). Bootstrapping procedures were also used to examine the mediation effects (Bollen & Stine, 1990; Shrout & Bolger, 2002). Moreover, the Wald test (Wald, 1943) was used to verify differences between girls and boys in regression weights (Acock, 2013). The IBM SPSS 23 software was used to calculate description statistics and correlation analysis, whereas the Stata 14 software was used for structural equation analysis and mediation analysis.

2.4. Results
The results of the differences analysis regarding the frequency of use of different applications on the smartphone are presented in Table 1. The difference between groups is connected with the following applications: talking, text messages, social networking, camera, organizer and stopwatch. More precisely, girls more often use such smartphone applications as talking, text messages, social networking, camera and organizer, whereas boys use stopwatch more often than girls. However, it should be noted that the magnitude of these differences is small.

For girls and boys group, the results of correlation analysis, as presented in Table 1, show that problematic smartphone use is negatively associated with social skills and grade point average. Additionally, there is a positive relationship between social anxiety: avoidance, somatization and problematic smartphone use. The exact results are shown in Table 2.

The results of independent samples t-tests show differences between girls and boys group (see Table 2). There is a difference between groups as regards social anxiety: fear and grade point average. More precisely, girls have a higher level of social anxiety: fear and higher grade point average as compared to boys. However, the magnitude of these differences is small. The exact results are shown in Table 3.

Based on the structural model analyses, it was established that the analyzed model fitted the data well: χ2(df=2) = 0.71; p = 0.700; χ2/df = 1.20; RMSEA = 0.001, SRMR = 0.006, CFI = 1.000 and TLI = 1.052. For girls group, social skills were negatively and significantly related to problematic smartphone use (β = −0.31, p < 0.001, 95%CI [-0.44–0.17]) and somatization (β = −0.27, p < 0.001, 95%CI [-0.42–0.13]). Additionally, there was a positive relationship between social skills and grade point average (β = 0.18, p = 0.006, 95%CI [0.05 0.30]). The results also showed that problematic smartphone use was negatively associated with grade point average (β = −0.19, p = 0.006, 95%CI [-0.31–0.06]). Moreover, there was a positive relationship between social anxiety: avoidance and somatization (β = 0.24, p = 0.006, 95%CI [0.07 0.41]). There was also a positive relationship between social anxiety: fear and grade point average (β = 0.38, p < 0.001, 95%CI [0.23 0.53]), whereas a negative relationship between social anxiety: avoidance and grade point average (β = −0.35, p < 0.001, 95%CI [-0.51–0.20]). The other regression weights were statistically insignificant. The detailed results are shown in Fig. 2.

For boys group, the results showed that social skills were negatively related to problematic smartphone use (β = −0.17, p = 0.020, 95%CI [-0.32–0.03]) and somatization (β = −0.27, p < 0.001, 95%CI [-0.40–0.14]). Additionally, social skills were positively associated with grade point average (β = 0.40, p < 0.001, 95%CI [0.29 0.51]). The results also showed that problematic smartphone use was negatively related to somatization (β = 0.30, p < 0.001, 95%CI [0.19 0.41]). Moreover, there was a positive relationship between social anxiety: avoidance and somatization (β = 0.32, p < 0.001, 95%CI [0.18 0.46]). The other regression weights were statistically insignificant.

The results of the difference analysis performed with the Wald test showed the presence of regression weights differences between girls and boys as regards the relation between social skills and grade point average (χ2(df=1) = 6.66; p = 0.010). More precisely, the standardized regression weight was stronger in boys group (β = 0.40, p < 0.001, 95%CI [0.29 0.51]), as compared to girls group (β = 0.18, p = 0.006, 95%CI [0.05 0.30]). Additionally, there was a difference between boys and girls group in the relation between social anxiety: fear and grade point average (χ2(df=1) = 8.79; p = 0.003). More precisely, the standardized regression weight was insignificant in boys group (β = 0.06, p = 0.461, 95%CI [-0.10 0.21]), whereas this relation was significant in girls group (β = 0.38, p < 0.001, 95%CI [0.23 0.53]). There were also quite statistically significant regression weights differences between girls and boys in the case of the relation between problematic smartphone use and somatization (χ2(df=1) = 3.80; p = 0.051). More precisely, the standardized regression weight was insignificant in female group (β = 0.12, p = 0.098, 95%CI [-0.02 0.27]), whereas this relation was significant in boys group (β = 0.30, p < 0.001, 95%CI [0.19 0.41]). The other difference between girls and boys in terms of the analyzed paths was statistically insignificant. Based on the bootstrapping procedures (Bollen & Stine, 1990; Shrout & Bolger, 2002), there was a significant indirect effect between social skills and grade point average via problematic smartphone use among girls group. Taking into account a direct significance effect between social skills and grade point average, these results may indicate partial mediation in girls group. Additionally, social skills had a significant indirect effect on somatization via problematic smartphone use among boys group. Given a direct significance effect between social skills and somatization, this result may indicate partial mediation among boys group. The detailed results are shown in Table 4.

3. Discussion
The main aim of the study was to verify the relationship between social anxiety, social skills via academic performance and somatic symptoms, where problematic smartphone use (PSU) was a mediator.

First the present study analyzed the relationship between susceptibility to problematic smartphone use and gender. The studies on this subject which appeared at the beginning of the expansion of mobile phones in society showed that problematic smartphone use affects boys more than girls (Bianchi & Phillips, 2005). Once the use of mobile phones was becoming more and more common the ratio was more even, while some of the studies on adolescents showed that girls had a stronger tendency to problematic smartphone use than boys (Fischer-Grote et al., 2019; Lee & Lee, 2017). In the present study no differences between girls and boys were observed as regards the increased intensity of problematic smartphone use. In the present studies there were gender differences in the frequency of use of smartphone applications. As compared to boys, girls more often use such smartphone applications as talking, text messages, social networking, camera and organizer, whereas boys more often use stopwatch (Chen et al., 2017).

Both in girls and boys group the results of correlation analysis showed a positive relationship between problematic smartphone use and one of dimensions of social anxiety, namely avoidance. There was no such relation in the case of social anxiety: fear. Therefore, the first research hypothesis on a positive relation between problematic smartphone use and social anxiety (H1) was only partially proven. Also other scientific studies show a positive relation between anxiety and problematic smartphone use (Ha et al., 2007; Lepp et al., 2013; Cheever et al., 2014; Panova & Lleras, 2016). Such anxiety most frequently results from limited or restricted access to one's own device (Cheever et al., 2014), whereas in extreme cases it may indicate pathologically increased intensity of problematic smartphone use (Enez Darcin et al., 2016; Elhai et al., 2017). On the one hand, the constant use of one's smartphone, checking notifications and awareness of being online are intended to reduce this anxiety, though such a behavior may lead to neglecting other activities of everyday life (King et al., 2013). On the other hand, some people excessively use their smartphones because they fear social exclusion (Lee & Lee, 2017). Fear of negative evaluation may inhibit traditional interactions with people and result in replacing them with less personal forms of contact or in undertaking activities that are performed independently (Winton et al., 1995; Weeks et al., 2008; Panova & Carbonell, 2018; Emirtekin at al., 2019), namely using smartphones. Withdrawal as an anxiety reaction and social deficits are associated with problematic smartphone use (Kim, Min, et al., 2019). People with low social skills prefer contacts with the use of mobile devices because they fear the necessity of interacting with others face to face (Reid & Reid, 2007). Communication via their smartphones allows them to compensate for their social skills (Gunuc & Dogan, 2013). Also in the present study the results of the correlation analysis showed a negative relation between problematic smartphone use and social skills both in girls and boys group. The obtained dependency proved to be the opposite than expected, and thus the second research hypothesis (H2) was not confirmed. People with high social skills show less symptoms of problematic smartphone use. The findings of other research prove that high social skills protect people from problematic smartphone use (Gunuc & Dogan, 2013; Lee & Lee, 2017; Fu et al., 2020). A high level of social skills allows for establishing satisfying social relations off-line, without resorting to the virtual environment, and achieving individual goals in interpersonal relations (Gunuc & Dogan, 2013). An easy interaction with the environment and the ability to adapt to the existing social situation allow students to achieve their goals, such as developing satisfying social relations and high average grades (Chen, 2018; Sarti et al., 2019). In this case using smartphones is a form of supporting and sustaining the established relationships – it is not their problematic replacement (Bian and Leung, 2014, Emirtekin et al., 2019). It seems, therefore, that low social competences combined with social anxiety or social phobia may increase the risk of PSU (Caplan, 2007; Enez Darcin et al., 2016; Sohn et al., 2019). For this reason, it is fundamental to provide children and adolescents with an appropriate social support and raise their social competences as factors protecting against PSU itself and its negative consequences (Ihm, 2018).

In each of the studied groups there was a positive relation between problematic smartphone use and somatization. Thus, the third research hypothesis (H3) was confirmed. Excessive use of mobile phones is associated with limited physical activity, which, in turn, results in poorer physical condition and deterioration of general physical health (Lanette et al., 2018; Acuff et al., 2018; Stiglic & Viner, 2019). Similarly to adults, children and adolescents with problematic smartphone use suffer more from somatic complaints. Most of them include symptoms related to the unnatural body posture while using smartphones, such as musculoskeletal discomfort, neck and shoulder discomfort, hand and arm disorders, as well as worse eyesight, headaches or sleep-related problems (Bowler & Bourke, 2019; Wood et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2016). Somatic difficulties experienced by children and adolescents may have a negative effect on other activities, including establishing social relations (Karkhanis & Winsler, 2016; Sohn et al., 2019), and they may also affect educational opportunities and school grades (Alosaimi et al., 2016). Therefore, PSU leads to an increase in both somatic and psychological symptoms (Sohn et al., 2019).

In both groups problematic smartphone use was negatively correlated with average school grades, and thus it confirmed the fourth research hypothesis (H4). Students with problematic smartphone use concentrate worse on currently performed tasks, including school duties (Cheever et al., 2014; Hawi & Rupert, 2016). Instead of acquiring knowledge or doing exercises, students excessively concentrate on their smartphones and sometimes use them during lessons, although it is not allowed (Sánchez-Martínez & Otero, 2009). Excessive use of mobile phones not only reduces time spent on learning, but it also decreases concentration on school-related issues, lowers students’ cognitive abilities and worsens psychophysical health problems, such as overload, agitation, fatigue, pain and malaise, which negatively affect the learning process (Alosaimi et al., 2016; Akca et al., 2019; Cheever et al., 2014; Pereira, et al., 2020). Also in other studies excessive use of smartphones is related to worse academic performance (Sánchez-Martínez & Otero, 2009; Seo et al., 2016).

In girls group a statistically significant positive relationship was found between social anxiety: avoidance and somatic symptoms, whereas in boys group between social anxiety: avoidance and somatic symptoms, as well as problematic smartphone use and somatic symptoms. The other paths were not statistically significant and the relationship between social anxiety and somatic symptoms both in girls and boys group was not significantly modified even when problematic smartphone use was a mediator. Therefore, the fifth research hypothesis that problematic smartphone use functions as a mediator in the relationship between social anxiety and somatic symptoms (H5) should be rejected. Although problematic smartphone use is statistically significant in the relation between social anxiety and somatic symptoms, it does not abolish the influence of social anxiety on somatic symptoms experienced by adolescents. The experience of social anxiety: avoidance constitutes an important risk factor of the presence of somatic symptoms in adolescents (Nordstrom et al., 2014; Weeks et al., 2008).

Further analyses showed that social skills were negatively related to problematic smartphone use and somatization both in boys and girls group. Additionally, in boys group social skills had a significant indirect effect on somatization via problematic smartphone use. Problematic smartphone use may abolish the relationship which protects the relation between a high level of social skills and lower occurrence of somatic symptoms (Bornstein et al., 2010). In boys group, higher intensity of somatic symptoms results partially from problematic smartphone use and not merely from some deficiencies in social skills. Also the research conducted by Yang et al. (2016) prove that boys who use smartphones report more somatic symptoms and a higher level of discomfort than girls. It may be related to gender differences as regards the use of smartphones, e.g. girls prefer phone calls which cause less musculoskeletal discomfort than playing games which is favored by boys. It has to be acknowledged that the sixth research hypothesis on the mediating role of problematic smartphone use in the relationship between social skills and somatic symptoms was only partially confirmed (H6) since in boys group there is only partial mediation between social skills and somatization via problematic smartphone use. Yet, social skills still need to be considered as the protection against somatic symptoms, especially in girls group where there was no mediation, because mediation was only partial (Bornstein et al., 2010; Karkhanis & Winsler, 2016; Elhai, et al., 2018). Also in girls group there was a positive relation between social anxiety: fear and average school grades, whereas a negative relation between social anxiety: avoidance and average school grades. The other regression weights were statistically insignificant and in both girls and boys group the relationship between social anxiety and school grades was not significantly modified even when problematic smartphone use functioned as a mediator. Therefore, the seventh research hypothesis, which focuses on the fact that problematic smartphone use plays an important role of a mediator for the relationship between social anxiety and academic performance, should be rejected (H7). As it was previously noted, the experience of social anxiety is a significant predictor of academic performance by adolescents, regardless of the presence of problematic smartphone use. High social anxiety effectively hinders the learning process and lowers adolescents’ results at school (Van Ameringen et al., 2003; Brook & Willoughby, 2015; Elhai, et al., 2018).

As it was previously stated, in both girls and boys group, social skills were negatively and significantly associated with problematic smartphone use. Moreover, there was a significant positive relation between social skills and average school grades in both groups. Problematic smartphone use may abolish the beneficial relation between social skills and high academic performance. In the case of girls, their excessive smartphone use may endanger successful education even if they have high social skills (Kim, Min, et al., 2019). The fact that girls are focused on a smartphone, and the various activities it offers, may negatively affect the learning process and academic performance (Alosaimi et al., 2016). The mediation between social skills and average school grades via problematic smartphone use was only partial, and it was reported only in girls group, therefore, the eighth research hypothesis proved only partially (H8). Social skills need to be considered as an important factor that influences adolescents’ school grades – both in girls and boys group, solely due to the partial nature of mediation (Wentzel, 1991). Studies show that in the course of their education boys rely on their initial learning skills and knowledge (Marcenaro-Gutierrez et al., 2017) and, therefore, previously developed social skills are less likely to be changed by some external factors, including problematic smartphone use.

3.1. Limitations and future research
Though exploratory in nature, the presented study has its limitations. The research plan was based on a correlational scheme and, thus, no cause-and-effect conclusions can be drawn. The presented model of mediation may be used as a potential starting point for some further research into the causal relationship between problematic smartphone use and social anxiety, social skills, somatic symptoms and academic performance of primary school students. The selected study group may also reveal some limitations. The studies were conducted on Polish students and the observed dependencies may have a different intensity in other cultural circles or age categories. Moreover, in the case of adolescents their self-esteem depends heavily on other people's opinions and, therefore, even in the study they may tend to present themselves more favorably.

For a more detailed analysis of the relationships between dependencies, more methodologically restrictive studies should be conducted with repeated measurement or experimental research. Additionally, the use of a combination of different data collection methods (and its triangulation) may minimize some susceptibility to social approval which occurs in self-reported methods. Taking into account the danger that problematic smartphone use poses on functioning of people at all ages, it is necessary to look for its conditioning in the case of the other age groups. A more detailed analysis of problematic smartphone use in the context of addictions to specific social applications, as Facebook or Instagram, would make an interesting direction for future research.

3.2. Conclusions
The presented research may contribute significantly to the understanding of a fairly new phenomenon of problematic smartphone use. PSU leads to worsening of daily functions as regards academic performance and weakening of social relations, and the experience of somatic and psychic changes. The conducted research, on the one hand, looks for the determinants of problematic smartphone use in the form of potential risk factors (social anxiety, social skills) but, on the other hand, it also indicates the possible consequences of excessive concentration on smartphones by primary school students, namely somatic symptoms and poor school results. At this stage of life, educational negligence and low school grades resulting from excessive focus on the smartphone may seriously limit the possibility of following bold learning and career paths in the future. It is also a period of intense development of the musculoskeletal system and, therefore, its excessive use accompanying problematic smartphone use may lead to somatic problems which may intensify over time and develop into chronic pains. Adolescence is also an important period for the development of the nervous system that is responsible for cognitive abilities and emotional stability in human development. A properly shaped cognitive and emotional system allows an individual to deal with different fears and situations which may cause social anxiety. The emotional aspect is also crucial in mastering social skills. Based on the obtained results of the present study, social skills seem to counteract problematic smartphone use among students and, therefore, they should be developed among them.

The results of the study may be used to prepare some preventive programs, organize early intervention and counteract problematic smartphone use among students. Definitely, in addition to providing the latest technological devices and learning how to use them efficiently, the principles of proper and effective use of smartphones should be promoted among young people. These include the following: the control over the time of use, the use of smartphones only in justified situations and treating smartphones as an addition to other daily activities and not their replacement. In schools and families, measures should be taken to eliminate psychological variables which coexist with problematic smartphone use, such as social anxiety and low social competences, and focus on the elements that protect from problematic smartphone use, such as social skills and family relationships. The undertaking of preventive and therapeutic interventions should also take into account sex differences, since there are different preferences as regards activities undertaken by girls and boys, and there are also different mechanisms of the impact of problematic smartphone use on the variables analyzed in the present study.
