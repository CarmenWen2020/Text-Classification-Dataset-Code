The increasing importance of digital reading and the prevalence of social media among adolescents necessitate further investigations into the effects of social media on the development of students' digital reading proficiency, which could foster proper behavior and attitudes regarding social media and help narrow achievement gaps in reading education. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of information and communication technology (ICT)-based social media factors, categorized into use and attitudinal factors, on adolescents' digital reading performance and to capture the trajectory of the impacts on generations of adolescents over nine years. Data from 767,511 15-year-old students from 57 countries/regions in total were extracted from the four cycles of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) database, i.e., PISA 2009, PISA 2012, PISA 2015 and PISA 2018. Hierarchical linear models were constructed to investigate significant student-, school- and country-level factors. The findings indicated that a) the effects of ICT-based social media use outside of school varied across different purposes and types of use and the influential patterns remained relatively unchanged; b) students’ use of ICT-based social media at school was negatively correlated with digital reading performance in general from PISA 2009 to PISA 2018; and c) students with positive attitudes towards ICT-based social media performed better on the digital reading assessment than those with negative attitudes.

1. Introduction
The age of information and communication technology (ICT) has witnessed a rapidly growing number of young digital readers (e.g., Mills, 2010). Since reading on digital devices involves emergent types of texts and generates new sociocultural practices, it is essential for students to master distinctive reading proficiency (OECD, 2011) to be qualified participants in their academic, social, and professional communication in an increasingly digitalized world (OECD, 2019a). Such a massive shift in the nature of reading necessitated an updated definition of reading proficiency and relevant assessment of digital reading performance. Thus, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a triennial large-scale international educational survey, conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which assesses 15-year-olds’ academic achievement, made the first attempt to measure students' digital reading performance worldwide with PISA 2009 and PISA 2018 further redefined reading literacy, underscoring the reading of dynamic texts in the digital environment. Accordingly, in the present study, digital reading performance refers to “understanding, using, evaluating, reflecting on and engaging with digital texts in order to achieve one's goals, to develop one's knowledge and potential and to participate in society” (see OECD, 2019a, p. 26).

The prevalence of social media among the young generation has also attracted educational researchers' attention (OECD, 2019b), especially in the post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic era where social media users and digital readers are on the rise and blended and remote learning is becoming an increasingly common practice (Silva et al., 2021). On one hand, social interaction is a key feature of digital reading. According to the connected reading model proposed by Turner, Hicks, and Zucker (2020), while reading practices always involve text circulation among readers, the social nature of reading is highlighted in the digital world, i.e., the creation and consumption of a variety of textual forms are rendered more convenient via social media. On the other hand, interactive communication platforms such as e-mail applications and social networking sites (SNSs) are rife with digital texts; for instance, in the PISA computer-based reading assessment, test items were designed to incorporate social media platforms such as blogs, forums, and online news (OECD, 2019a). Insights into the roles of social media in improving or hindering students' digital reading performance could assist educators in helping adolescents regard and use social media properly, identifying pedagogical and administrative implications for technology-assisted learning (Costa, Hammond, & Younie, 2019), and helping promote equity in reading education. Whereas researchers have thoroughly investigated the effects of social media factors on students' general academic achievement (e.g., Feng, Wong, Wong, & Hossain, 2019; Junco, 2012; Kirschner & Karpinski, 2010; Lambic, 2016; Muls, Thomas, De Backer, Zhu, & Lombaerts, 2020), relatively few studies have revealed the effects of social media on students' digital reading performance, especially in the PISA research context, for which both positive (e.g., Gil-Flores, Torres-Gordillo, & Perera-Rodríguez, 2012; Lim & Jung, 2019) and negative effects (e.g., Lee & Wu, 2013; Wu & Peng, 2017) have been revealed. Moreover, most of these PISA-related studies have been limited in some sense because the factors explored were confined to individuals’ general use of social media, no consistent conclusion was reached, and the PISA 2009 database utilized in these studies collected computer-based reading data from only 19 countries/regions.

Most importantly, although the recent decade has witnessed the rapid development of social media per se, the steady increase in the use of social media among adolescents (OECD, 2019b) and the emerging rise of usage divide (van Dijk & Hacker, 2003; Zhong, 2011), the overwhelming majority of the relevant studies focused on a single cross-sectional database rather than longitudinal data, leaving the dynamics of the influential patterns of social media on digital reading performance rarely investigated, which is essential for researchers to determine the essence of such impacts and for educators and policy makers to grasp the changes and to perceive the potential trend in adolescents’ digital reading scenario.

Therefore, the present study aimed to reveal the effects of ICT-based social media on 15-year-old students’ digital reading performance and the trajectory of the influential patterns over nearly a decade. Dimensions of ICT-based social media were conceptualized into two broad categories: use and attitude. Specifically, hierarchical linear models (HLMs) were constructed to analyze data at the student, school, and country levels, with demographic information, and two variables concerning school- and country-level features were controlled. To track the usage and the impact of ICT-based social media across time, data from PISA 2009, PISA 2012, PISA 2015 and PISA 2018 were utilized to examine the influential patterns for four groups of adolescents at four time points, encompassing 767,511 students from 57 countries/regions in total.

2. Literature review
2.1. ICT-based social media
Compared to general digital device use, specific types of online activities have different impacts on users (e.g., Wilmer, Sherman, & Chein, 2017). Thus, the effects of ICT-based social media, as an indispensable component of ICT (Bretschneider & Parker, 2016; Martinez-Cerda, Torrent-Sellens, & Gonzalez-Gonzalez, 2018), is the focus of the present study.

ICT-based social media can be defined as a variety of Web 2.0-based technologies that emphasize the social aspects of the Internet such as the creation and sharing of user-generated content (e.g., Dabbagh & Kitsantas, 2012; Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010; Smith, 2016), in other words, “any application or technology through which users participate in, create, and share media resources and practices with other users by means of digital networking” (Reinhardt, 2019, p. 3). Typical types of ICT-based social media include email applications, instant messaging (IM) applications (e.g., Skype), blogs, wikis, SNSs (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), social news websites (e.g., Reddit; see Kong, Lai-Ku, Deng, & Yan-Au, 2021), video-sharing sites (e.g., YouTube), and online games (e.g., World of Warcraft) (e.g., Jacobsen & Forste, 2011; Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010; Reinhardt, 2019).

Dimensions of ICT-based social media can be classified into three categories: access to ICT-based social media, use of ICT-based social media, and attitude towards ICT-based social media, which reflect the classification of ICT (e.g., Hu, Gong, Lai, & Leung, 2018; OECD, 2011; Xiao, Liu, & Hu, 2019). The latter two categories will be discussed in this study due to the availability of variables in the PISA database.

2.2. Students’ use of ICT-based social media
With ICT-based social media being widely adopted for educational purposes (e.g., Tang & Hew, 2017), a substantial number of studies have investigated the effects of ICT-based social media use on students' academic achievement, the mixed results of which have indicated that social media use might be regarded as a “double-edged sword” (Andersson, Hatakka, Gronlund, & Wiklund, 2014, p. 45). However, notably, communicative activities conducted on Facebook (e.g., commenting and creating events) were positively related to students’ academic engagement (Junco, 2012), suggesting that the effects of social media use were mixed.

A relatively small number of studies have explored the effects of the frequency of social media use on secondary students’ digital reading performance, mostly utilizing the PISA 2009 database in which reading was assessed as the major domain among the three domains. However, inconsistent conclusions were drawn. For instance, both negative effects (Lee & Wu, 2013) and positive effects (Gil-Flores et al., 2012; Lim & Jung, 2019; Wu & Peng, 2017) were found, suggesting diverse effects of social media use across areas. The flexible effects of social media use on digital reading performance have also revealed that highly socially engaged students might be less efficient in digital reading tasks, although they might not be less effective in their navigating practices in digital texts (Naumann, 2015). In contrast, a positive correlation between the frequency of online social reading activities and digital reading performance was discovered (Gil-Flores et al., 2012; Lim & Jung, 2019), where online social activities considered included chatting, reading emails, and reading news. Noting the varied effects of different frequencies of use, OECD (2011) speculated an “optimum threshold” for social reading activities, which suggests that unfamiliarity with these activities might result in low digital reading scores but that students using emails and chatting online too frequently might perform worse than moderately involved users. Taken together, the existing literature is not yet conclusive enough to endorse any firm conclusions on the effects of social media on digital reading performance.

Moreover, the use of ICT, which comprises a wider range of digital technologies (Chen & Hu, 2020), has been found to affect students' reading performance in different manners and in different use contexts (i.e., at school and outside of school) (Hammond, 2020), with different use purposes (i.e., recreational and academic purposes), and with different types of social media. Most studies found that using ICT at school negatively affected students’ reading performance (e.g., Hu et al., 2018; Petko, Cantieni, & Prasse, 2017; Skryabin, Zhang, Liu, & Zhang, 2015); however, mixed effects were found with respect to the use of ICT outside of school — recreational use imposed either positive effects (e.g., Hu et al., 2018; Skryabin et al., 2015) or negative effects (e.g., Petko et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2019). Similarly, the effects of academic use of ICT were found to be either positive (e.g., Petko et al., 2017; Skryabin et al., 2015) or negative (e.g., Hu et al., 2018).

As an indispensable aspect of ICT, ICT-based social media was shown to be widely used by adolescents for both recreational and academic purposes; in addition, it was used for both formal learning (i.e., highly structured learning such as that in school) and informal learning (i.e., more spontaneous learning that was determined by learners and usually occurred outside of schools) (Dabbagh & Kitsantas, 2012). Nonetheless, detailed investigations into the effects of ICT-based social media use in different settings and for different purposes are far from abundant. The concept of “contextualized digital reading,” as manifested in the study of Smith and Wilhelm (2002) who studied adolescent males with a focus on both in-school and out-of-school literacy, implies that the effects of social media on digital reading performance might vary in different contexts. In addition, the diverse types of ICT devices used by students, i.e., specialized programs such as chatting applications and online games, were shown to influence different domains of learning in different directions, which indicates the need for more in-depth investigations into specific types of digital devices (e.g., Cheema & Zhang, 2013; Skryabin et al., 2015).

Taken together, despite substantial efforts, studies on the effects of adolescents’ social media use on their academic performance, especially in terms of digital reading performance, are still limited in scope (i.e., social media use studied as a whole) and quantity (i.e., mainly based on the PISA 2009 database), which hinders their ability to explore the effects of social media from a wider range of samples and for a longer period of time to guide educational practices inside and outside of schools.

2.3. Students’ attitudes towards ICT-based social media
Among students' attitudes towards social media, a particular attitudinal factor is students’ perceptions of the usefulness of ICT-based social media. As defined by Davis (1989), the perceived usefulness of digital devices refers to “the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance” (p. 320), which is an important factor in driving individuals to use a certain technology.

A large number of studies have demonstrated that students' positive perceptions of the usefulness of social media lead to their frequent use of social media to support learning (e.g., Alyoussef, 2020; Owusu, Bekoe, Otoo, & Koli, 2019; Smith, 2016). For instance, based on the technology acceptance model (TAM), site usefulness has been shown to significantly influence Malaysian undergraduate students' intentions to use social media for academic purposes (Ali, Yaacob, Endut, & Sulam, 2018). Furthermore, Keskin, Bastug, and Atmaca (2016) indicated that promoting students' interest in technology and enhancing their inclination to use technology might render better achievement with respect to academic digital reading. Similarly, Lambic (2016) not only found that the positive effects of perceived usefulness greatly affected students’ academic use of social media but also observed a positive correlation between such academic use and academic performance. However, Cooke (2017) discovered a slightly different influential pattern: although college students considered the integration of social media into academic activities to be useful and believed it improved their learning experience, generally, their motivation and learning objectives were not affected.

However, all participants in the aforementioned studies were postsecondary students, and attitude towards social media was mainly considered as a determinant of social media use rather than a determinant of digital reading performance. Moreover, while previous researchers have explored the impacts of social media attitudes on academic achievement (Lambic, 2016) and the impacts of ICT attitudes on digital reading performance (e.g., Keskin et al., 2016; Lim & Jung, 2019), few have investigated the relationship between social media attitudes, a subdimension of ICT attitudes, and academic achievement in any subject. As a result, whether 15-year-old students’ attitudes towards ICT-based social media are related to their digital reading performance remains unanswered in the current literature.

2.4. Rationale for the current study
Despite the great efforts of previous researchers to investigate the student- and school-level factors of social media use and attitude, the impacts of these factors on students' digital reading performance require further exploration for three reasons. First, whereas the effects of social media on students' academic achievement have been investigated relatively thoroughly, the relationship between social media and digital reading performance has not been explored in much detail. Second, in the previous studies that used the PISA 2009 database to explore the effects of social media-related factors on digital reading performance, the sample sizes were relatively small, only factors related to the general use of social media at the student level were discussed, and their findings were inconsistent. Third, although some efforts have been made by previous researchers to investigate the long-term effects of other factors, such as ICT use, demographic characteristics and socioeconomic configurations, on students' academic achievements using the PISA database (e.g., Fernández-Gutiérrez, Gimenez, & Calero, 2020; Lenkeit, Schwippert, & Knigge, 2018; Zhang & Liu, 2016; Zhong, 2011), few insights into the effects of social media on digital reading performance have been attained from a longitudinal perspective, which leaves the trajectory of the evolving effects uninvestigated. However, the findings of the aforementioned studies revealed either the dynamic change or the stability of the influential patterns over time, which could provide insights into the long-term effects of social media. For instance, Lenkeit et al. (2018) revealed the dynamic changes in the effects of students' individual characteristics on reading performance, along with the trend of the relative importance and configuration of these factors, using data from PISA 2000 to PISA 2012 of four European countries: Sweden, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. Their findings indicated that whereas “girls' advantage over boys” (p. 60) in reading performance and the positive effects of number of books at home and parental occupation were found to remain relatively stable across the 12 years, the effects of other traits fluctuated between cycles. The overall relevance of the factors investigated, however, increased for Sweden, decreased for Germany and France, and remained stable for the UK, resulting from several educational reform measures and initiatives. Moreover, it is worth noting that consistent trends were identified by Zhang and Liu (2016). Based on the data from PISA 2000 to PISA 2012 encompassing 1,241,031 students worldwide, they revealed the constantly negative effects of ICT use and positive effects of ICT self-confidence on students' mathematics and science performance over time, indicating that the influential patterns of ICT use and attitude remained relatively unchanged. Similar steady influence was revealed by Zhong (2011), in which ICT access at home was found to be positively related to adolescents’ self-reported digital skills in 16 countries across two cycles of PISA—i.e., PISA 2003 and PISA 2006. Nevertheless, whether the effects of social media factors on digital reading performance, which are the focus of the present study, were stable or fluctuant over the past decade needs in-depth investigation. Moreover, further efforts can be made to explore how the relevance of social media factors in creating reading performance disparities changed over time.

To fill these research gaps, the current study aimed to reveal the effects of student-, school- and country-level ICT-based social media factors on 15-year-old students’ digital reading performance over time. As mentioned above, ICT-based social media factors can be classified into three categories: access to ICT-based social media, use of ICT-based social media, and attitude towards ICT-based social media. Since information on access to ICT-based social media is not directly available in the PISA database, the latter two categories were the focus of the present study (see Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. The conceptual framework of the current study. Note. The sequence of the use-related factors was determined by referring to the arrangement of variables in the PISA database.

Accordingly, given the preliminary research in this area and based on the PISA 2009, PISA 2012, PISA 2015 and PISA 2018 databases, which are all PISA cycles that include the ICT-based social media exploration, the following hypotheses were addressed in this study. It is worth noting that the inductive approach to research provides an inductive hypothesis theoretically appropriate and empirically feasible for the current study. While deductive hypotheses originate from theory, inductive hypotheses are based on observation or evidence provided by previous empirical studies (Toledo, Flikkema, & Toledo-Pereyra, 2011). Theoretically, heeding Locke’s (2007) call for an inductive approach that allows the publication of papers that do not deductively test theoretically derived hypotheses, Spector, Rogelberg, Ryan, Schmitt, and Zedeck (2014) noted that the exploration of new phenomena or ways of viewing phenomena might be hindered by the lack of a theoretical framework. Empirically, previous studies demonstrated that it is feasible to adopt inductive hypotheses when a preconceived theoretical framework that addresses the research interests is lacking whereas findings of prior research lay the basis for further investigation.

Hypothesis 1

The relationship between adolescents' use of ICT-based social media and their digital reading performance varies with respect to different settings of use, purposes of use, and types of social media used.

Hypothesis 2

Adolescents' perceived usefulness of ICT-based social media and their overall attitudes towards ICT-based social media at school have positive effects on their digital reading performance.

Hypothesis 3

Over a period of 9 years, i.e., from PISA 2009 to PISA 2018, the influential pattern of ICT-based social media on adolescents' digital reading performance remains relatively unchanged.

3. Methods
3.1. Data
The data for the present study were mainly retrieved from the databases for the latest four cycles of the PISA assessment, i.e., PISA 2009, PISA 2012, PISA 2015 and PISA 2018 (URL: http://www.oecd.org.ezproxy.auckland.ac.nz/pisa/data/) to enable the examination of the status quo and the changing patterns of the impacts of ICT-based social media on adolescents’ digital reading performance across countries/economies over time. In addition, country-level data (i.e., the logarithm of national gross domestic product per capita) were originally retrieved from the World Bank database (URL: https://data.worldbank.org/).

The four databases were selected considering the availability of information about adolescents' digital reading performance and the relatively abundant variables related to ICT-based social media. First, as a triennial large-scale international survey, the PISA mainly assesses 15-year-old students' competency of reading, mathematics, and science, with one of the three subjects alternately featuring the major domain (OECD, 2019a). PISA 2009 was the first cycle for which a subsample of the participating countries/regions (19 out of 75) completed the computer-based reading assessment, after which the proportions were 32 out of 65 countries/regions in PISA 2012, 57 out of 72 in PISA 2015, and 70 out of 79 in PISA 2018; thus, the four cycles were considered to be suitable for the current analysis of digital reading, and the simultaneous inclusion of the four PISA cycles enables the investigation of the potential changes in the effects on digital reading over time. Second, an advantage of the PISA database is that it provides a wide range of student- and school-level contextual information (Chen, Zhang, Wei, & Hu, 2019) and the coherent design of the background questionnaires enables monitoring trends over time — the variables pertaining to the conceptual framework proposed by this study remained relatively stable in the latest four cycles of PISA, which made it possible to capture the trend of the impacts of ICT-based social media on generations of adolescents’ digital reading performance over nine years. To fully exploit the ICT-based social media factors proposed in the conceptual framework and to capture the dynamics of the effects of ICT-based social media over time while maintaining the representativeness of the sample, this study focused on countries/regions that participated in the computer-based assessment of reading and completed the student questionnaire, the school questionnaire, and the ICT familiarity questionnaire. Namely, each country/region in each cycle that met the above criteria was included in this study (see Zhong, 2011). As a result, after excluding countries/regions whose data were completely missing on the required variables, 57 countries/regions (including overlapping countries/regions across the four cycles) were selected, with a total of 767,511 students (female = 382,841) from 27,943 schools. The detailed demographic information for each PISA cycle is presented in Table 1.

3.2. Variables
The dependent variable was students' performance in the PISA computer-based reading assessment, represented by 5 plausible values (PVs) for each student in PISA 2009 and PISA 2012 and by 10 PVs in PISA 2015 and PISA 2018. Considering that each student was measured with a subset of the test items, PVs were computed by the PISA to provide unbiased estimates of the possible level of students’ reading performance. For detailed information on the procedure used to conduct the assessment, see the PISA assessment framework and technical report (OECD, 2019a; 2019b).

With respect to the independent and control variables, the student- and school-level variables were extracted from the four PISA databases, specifically from the student questionnaires, school questionnaires, and ICT familiarity questionnaires. It is worth noting that although the present study adopted all variables relevant to the research questions of each of the four PISA cycles, which was proven feasible (Zhang & Liu, 2016), the ICT questionnaires underwent revision each cycle and became increasingly comprehensive; therefore, the numbers and the value scales of variables related to ICT-based social media were slightly different across time, which means that the available time spans for analyzing the trend for each variable vary and calls for careful interpretation. Specifically, the number of variables increased with time: the variables available in PISA 2015 and PISA 2018 were completely consistent with the conceptual framework, while the attitudinal factors of the former two cycles were not available; the value scale for ICT-based social media use ranged from 1 to 4 in PISA 2009 and was expanded to 1 to 5 in the latter three cycles. However, the variables were ensured to be comparable across cycles by examining the PISA questionnaire wordings and PISA codebooks, and the expansion of the value scale was not considered as a problem through our conversion of the categorical variables into dummy variables. In addition, to represent each school's social media climate, two school-level variables (i.e., overall use at school and overall perceived usefulness) were derived from the student-level variables by computing the median of students' responses at each school (see Hu et al., 2018). Since the ICT Development Index (IDI) 2018 developed by the International Communication Union (ITU) is not available to date, only one country-level control variable (i.e., the logarithm of national gross domestic product per capita) was retrieved from the World Bank database and the logarithm was computed (see Hu et al., 2018; Skryabin et al., 2015). The description, value scale, value range, mean, and standard deviation of the independent variables and control variables at each level are all presented in Table 2.

Note. For ease of reference, the variables in the original PISA datasets were recorded in the present study. For PISA 2015 and PISA 2018, the original codes for the chosen variables, except for the two derived variables, were “IC008Q03TA”, “IC008Q04TA”, “IC008Q05NA”, “IC008Q07TA”, “IC008Q08TA”, “IC008Q09TA”, “IC010Q03TA”, “IC010Q04TA”, “IC010Q05NA”, “IC010Q06NA”, “IC011Q01TA”, “IC011Q02TA”, “IC013Q05NA”, “ST004D01T”, “ESCS”, “SC001Q01TA”, “SCHLTYPE”, and “SCHSIZE”, respectively. For PISA 2009, the original codes were “IC04Q04”, “IC04Q05”, “IC04Q06”, “IC05Q02”, “IC05Q03”, “IC06Q01”, “IC06Q02”, and “ST04Q01”. For PISA 2012, the original codes were “IC08Q03”, “IC08Q04”, “IC08Q05”, “IC08Q06”, “IC08Q07”, “IC09Q02”, “IC09Q03”, “IC10Q01”, “IC10Q02” and “ST04Q01”. For ESCS in PISA 2009 and PISA 2012, the trend indices computed by PISA were used to substitute the original index to ensure comparability across time. The mean and standard error for each PISA cycle were computed by taking the average of the multiply imputed datasets.

3.3. Data preprocessing
Prior to the outcome analysis, data preprocessing was conducted.

First, the missing data were addressed using multiple imputation (MI), as recommended in PISA-related studies (Scherer & Siddiq, 2015). In the present study, a relatively large amount of missing data occurred for some of the variables. The variables with the highest proportion of missing data were USEACA2 (3.7%) in PISA 2009, USESCH2 (6.3%) in PISA 2012, ATT (16.7%) in PISA 2015, and ATT (21.2%) in PISA 2018. The data were assumed to be missing at random as a result of the rotated test design of the PISA assessment, i.e., students were randomly assigned to booklets instead of completing all sets of items (Scherer & Siddiq, 2015). Thus, MI, considered superior compared to listwise deletion or single imputation in addressing missing data (Enders, 2010), was adopted. Specifically, the predictive mean matching method was utilized to generate the imputed datasets in IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0. To ensure the quality of the imputed data, m = 5 was adopted for PISA 2009 and PISA 2012, which achieved an efficiency of 98% for 10% missing data, and m = 10 was adopted for PISA 2015 and PISA 2018, which achieved an efficiency of 99% for 10% missing data and 97% for 30% missing data (Schafer & Olsen, 1998), thus being considered appropriate in this study. Then, the multiplied imputed data (e.g., MI_1, MI_2, MI_3, etc.) and the plausible values of digital reading performance (e.g., PV_1, PV_2, PV_3, etc.) were incorporated by combining datasets with the same tag, i.e., MI_1 was combined with PV_1.

Second, the country-specific and school-specific correlation matrices and variance inflation factors (VIFs) were computed to detect whether multicollinearity existed due to the relatively large number of multilevel variables used in this study (see Tables S1 to S10 in Supplementary Materials). Since none of the correlation coefficients exceeded 0.80 and every VIF was below 10 (Field, 2009), all variables were maintained for further analysis.

Third, to ensure the ease of data interpretation and comparison, categorical variables were converted into dummy variables, the values of which were either 0 or 1, and continuous variables were z-score standardized. As the levels of the social media frequency and attitude variables we chose were in ascending order, we set the variables of level = 1 as the reference groups for ease of interpretation.

3.4. Hierarchical linear modeling
The statistical HLMs, built with the computing software Hierarchical Linear & Nonlinear Modeling 8 (Raudenbush, Bryk, Cheong, & Congdon, 2019) (License ID: 1686), were adopted in the present study given their advantage in addressing the PISA data structure, that is, data clustered at the student, school, and country levels as a result of the two-stage sampling procedure (OECD, 2009). Unlike traditional methods such as multiple linear regression models that might produce aggregation bias and unreliable standard errors in dealing with a multilevel data structure (e.g., Hu et al., 2018; Skryabin et al., 2015). An HLM, also referred to as a multilevel model, accounts for the substantial proportion of variance that exists between different schools and countries, thus reducing the risk of statistical errors (Hox, 2010). Hence, HLMs have been widely applied to explore student-, school-, and country-level factors that influence academic achievements in the PISA research field (e.g., Alacaci & Erbas, 2010; Hu et al., 2018; Lim & Jung, 2019) and were adopted in the present study as well. Considering analysis practicality as a result of the model's complexity, the research aim focused on the nature instead of the heterogeneity of effects, and the basis laid by previous studies (e.g., Hu et al., 2018; Skryabin et al., 2015), random intercept fixed slopes models were built in the current study.

Specifically, the models were constructed step by step (Hox, 2010).

First, a one-way analysis of variance null model without independent or control variables (Model 1) was built to test the significance of the variance at each of the three levels and to determine the necessity of multilevel analysis by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (Cohen, 1988).

Second, Model 2 included the significant control variables from all three levels to identify the proportion of additional variance in digital reading performance explained by these variables (see Supplementary Materials Tables S11 and S12). The backward method was used to eliminate nonsignificant variables from this and the following models, namely, the variables were first integrated jointly to test the effect of each variable along with those of the other coexisting variables, and the statistically nonsignificant variable with the largest p-value was deleted. This process was repeated until all the remaining variables were statistically significant (Field, 2009).

Then, the independent variables at each level were integrated into the model successively. Model 3 included all the significant student-level variables (see Table S13 in Supplementary Materials). Model 4 included all the significant student-level and school-level variables (see Tables S14 and S15 in Supplementary Materials), with all the school-level variables added simultaneously to Model 3 to test their significance until all statistically significant variables were included.

Finally, the abovementioned process was repeated for the remaining variable, i.e., the country-level variable LnGDP, to build the final model with a random intercept and fixed slopes (Model 5), the mixed model of which is as follows:(1)where.

, , and  refer to the fixed slopes of A student-level variables, B school-level variables, and C country-level variables, respectively; and.

, , and  refer to the residual error terms for students, schools, and countries, respectively, the variances of which constitute the random effects.

The aforementioned analyses were conducted for each of the four PISA cycles separately; for each cycle, the multiply imputed datasets with the PVs were used for analysis successively, after which the data were pooled according to Rubin’s (1987) rules using the HLM software so that appropriate estimates that incorporate the uncertainty resulting from imputation could be produced. In addition, normalized student weights were used throughout the analyses for unbiased estimation (OECD, 2009).

To ensure the reliability of the estimates, the statistical assumptions for HLM were checked for the full model by visually inspecting the residuals at each level (Hox, 2010). Specifically, scatter plots were drawn using SPSS 20.0 to inspect linearity at each level and homoscedasticity at level 1. Histograms and Q-Q plots were drawn to inspect normality at each of the three levels (see Figures S1 to S4 in Supplementary Materials).

Additionally, to determine the magnitude of the effects revealed by the models, the present study adopted , or variance explained, as the measure of the effect size for the model at each level, in line with previous studies. The variance explained refers to the proportion of original unexplained variance that was explained by the variables included in the model (Hox, 2010), which can be demonstrated as follows:(2)
 
where.

 refers to the unexplained variance for the model without the explanatory variables, which is Model 1 in this study;

 refers to the unexplained variance for the model with the explanatory variable of interest. In the present study, all the following models, especially the final model, are used.

Accordingly, 0.02 indicating a small effect, 0.15 a medium effect, and 0.35 a large effect (Cohen, 1988) were used to determine the effect size of the models in the present study.

4. Results
The models were constructed successively based on the step-by-step model building strategy for each of the four PISA cycles.

First, the necessity of conducting multilevel analysis was determined by constructing the null model (Model 1). As shown in Table 3, for all four PISA cycles, both the average between-school variance and between-country variance were higher than 13.8%, indicating high ICC (Cohen, 1988), which is one of the main model assumptions for HLM (Hox, 2010). Therefore, it was crucial to conduct further analysis to identify the effects of variables at each level.

Note. Mean and range refer to the mean and range of the 5 multiply imputed datasets with 5 PVs for PISA 2009 and PISA 2012 and the 10 multiply imputed datasets with the 10 PVs for PISA 2015 and PISA 2018.

Second, the statistical significance of the control variables at the three levels and the proportion of additional variance in digital reading performance explained by these variables, i.e., , were identified in Model 2. In PISA 2018, all the variables except the dummy variable SCHLOC_2 (school location: a small town) were found to be significantly correlated with digital reading performance (see Table S1 in Supplementary Materials). Since dummy variables were seen as integral constructs of the original variable (Field, 2009), SCHLOC_2 was retained. For both PISA 2009 and PISA 2012, SCHLOC and LnGDP were nonsignificant and thus were excluded. Comparing the random effects of Model 2 and Model 1, the student-level ranged from 3.46% to 5.91%, the school-level  ranged from 25.36% to 34.53%, and the country-level  ranged from 33.64% to 59.33% for the four PISA cycles.

Next, to ensure that all the variables to be incorporated into the full model would be significant, Model 3 and Model 4 were constructed successively (see Table S2 in Supplementary Materials, and Tables S3 and S4 in Supplementary Materials). Excluding the nonsignificant dummy variables as explained above, in Model 3, all the student-level variables were found to be significantly related to digital reading performance (p < 0.05) and were thus retained for further analysis. In Model 4, only M_USESCH for PISA 2012 and M_ATT for PISA 2015 were nonsignificant and excluded.

Finally, to identify the effects of factors related to ICT-based social media on digital reading performance and to examine the change in the effects across nine years, the full random intercept and fixed slope models (Model 5) were built. All the model assumptions were assumed to be met (see Figures S1-S4 in Supplementary Materials). The fixed and random effects of the final model for the four PISA cycles are presented in Table 4 and reported as follows.

Note. The statistics are based on the mean of the 10 multiply imputed datasets with the 10 PVs for PISA 2015 and PISA 2018 and 5 multiply imputed datasets with 5 PVs for PISA 2009 and PISA 2012. P values exceeding 0.05 are deemed nonsignificant and highlighted in bold.

Use outside of school. The results indicated that the effects of students' recreational use of ICT-based social media outside of school on their digital reading performance varied in terms of different types of social media used, and the influential patterns seemed to remain relatively stable over time: for all PISA cycles, using email (USEREC1), browsing Internet websites for fun (USEREC5), and reading online news (USEREC6) tended to have consistently and significantly positive effects, whereas playing online games via SNSs (USEREC4) was likely to impose negative effects. However, the impacts of the other two types of social media were less stable. From PISA 2009 to PISA 2015, chatting online (USEREC2) tended to negatively influence students’ digital reading performance, whereas for PISA 2018, the effects were negative if the frequency was relatively low but became positive as the frequency increased. In PISA 2012 and PISA 2015, positive effects of using SNSs (USEREC3) at a high frequency were found; such positive effects, however, became mildly negative in PISA 2018, revealing that the effects of using SNSs were generally negative.

With respect to students' use of ICT-based social media outside of school for academic purposes, using SNSs to communicate with other students about schoolwork (USEACA3) had positive effects on students’ digital reading performance for both PISA 2015 and PISA 2018, whereas using SNSs to communicate with teachers (USEACA4) showed negative effects for the two cycles. In addition, using email to communicate with other students about schoolwork (USEACA1) and frequently using email for communication with teachers (USEACA2) showed negative effects throughout the decade.

General use at school. Generally, an increasing trend of the negative effects of individual students' use of social media at school was revealed. From PISA 2009 to PISA 2018, students who reported chatting online at school nearly every day (USESCH1_4) or every day (USESCH1_5) were found to perform worse in the digital reading assessment than their peers who never or hardly ever used social media at schools. Moreover, the positive effects of occasionally using email at school (USESCH2_2) in PISA 2009 diminished as time went by. In contrast, the effects of the overall frequency of adolescents' social media use at a particular school (M_USESCH) varied over years. In PISA 2009 and 2015, it was negatively correlated with students’ digital reading performance, but the effects turned positive in PISA 2018.

Attitude towards ICT-based social media. The results of both PISA 2015 and PISA 2018 indicated the significantly positive effects of students' perceived usefulness of ICT-based social media (ATT) on their digital reading performance. Nevertheless, only in PISA 2018 was a positive relationship was found between students' overall attitudes towards social media at a particular school (M_ATT) and individuals’ digital reading performance.

Random effects. As shown in Table 4, compared with Model 1, the student-level of the full model was slightly above 10% for PISA 2009 and PISA 2012, indicating relatively small effect sizes, whereas for PISA 2015 and PISA 2018, the  values were slightly above 15%, which means the effect size increased to medium. All school- and country-level  values from PISA 2009 to PISA 2018 indicated medium to high effect sizes.

5. Discussion
Through step-by-step multilevel analyses of 767,511 students’ data from four cycles of PISA digital reading assessment, the present study investigated the effects of ICT-based social media use and attitude on the digital reading performance of 15-year-old students and the trend within a decade thereof by analyzing student-, school-, and country-level variables.

The findings contributed to the existing literature in four main ways. First, as suggested by the effect size measures of the full models, a respectable and growing proportion of variance in students' digital reading performance was explained by ICT-based social media-related factors, confirming the increasingly pronounced roles of social media in explaining the between-student and between-school differences in digital reading performance. Second, it was found that the effects of ICT-based social media use varied across different settings of use, purposes of use, and types of social media used, adding to the findings of previous studies that regarded social media use as a whole. Third, new findings on the effects of student- and school-level ICT-based social media attitudes and school-level use factors on adolescents’ digital reading performance have seldom been explored in the previous literature. Fourth, the present study mapped the trajectory of the effects of ICT-based social media for nearly a decade, which has rarely been investigated before: findings indicated the generally stable effects from PISA 2009 to PISA 2018, and several emerging trends were revealed as well.

5.1. Recreational use outside of school
The effects of ICT-based social media use outside of school were found to vary across different purposes of use and types of social media used.

Different types of ICT-based social media used for recreational purposes were considered in the present study, including email applications, chatting applications, SNSs, online games via SNSs, fun websites, and online news, the different influential patterns of which shed light on the complex impacts of “specialized programs” (Cheema & Zhang, 2013, p. 104) and add to the evidence of previous studies that reported the effects of recreational use of technology as a whole.

Specifically, the recreational use of email, online news reading for fun, and browsing the Internet for fun (e.g., watching YouTube) were positively correlated with students' digital reading performance from PISA 2009 to PISA 2018, which partly confirmed the findings of Gil-Flores et al. (2012) that online social activities were relevant in explaining young people's digital reading performance but contradicted the findings of Lee and Wu (2013) that social entertainment activities negatively influenced adolescents' reading performance. Considering that in the study of Lee and Wu, reading performance was assessed based on both printed and digital performance, the contrasting findings suggest that using ICT-based social media for fun might not be an absolute hindrance to the development of digital reading skills. One possible explanation of the positive effects of these three types of social media use for leisure is that students who are engaged in certain online social activities have more chances to develop skills essential for digital reading, such as “complex applications of prior knowledge sources, inferential reasoning strategies, and self-regulated reading processes” (Coiro & Dobler, 2007, p. 229). Another reason might be that these text-based entertainment platforms provided students with the opportunity to engage in “leisure reading”, i.e., noncompulsory, voluntary reading activities, which contribute to the development of students' “vocabulary, reading comprehension, verbal fluency, and content knowledge” (Hughes-Hassell & Rodge, 2007, p. 22), which are essential for successful digital reading. The stable influential patterns across a decade further verified such positive effects.

In contrast, playing online games via SNSs was found to have negative effects on digital reading performance, which resonates with the findings of Junco (2012) showing that playing games on Facebook leads to college students' poor academic engagement but contradicts the findings of Biagi and Loi (2013) showing that gaming was positively correlated with adolescents' digital reading performance. This contradiction might be due to the differences between the variables used in these studies; since the latter work treated gaming as a combined construct of individual and collaborative gaming, it remained to be seen whether the effects were still negative when only online games involving social interaction were accounted for. This finding also extends that of Borgonovi (2016), which showed that frequent engagement with collaborative online games is generally associated with a steep reduction in digital reading performance. Such negative effects of online games via social media might be because compared to other social media activities such as using email, gaming involves less communication and therefore less input of textual information. However, future empirical studies are needed to justify this hypothesized mechanism. Generally, the frequent use of SNSs for recreational purposes was found to hinder students' digital reading performance, and such negative effects tended to increase over time. SNSs have been widely identified as academic distractions by researchers within the latest decade (Feng et al., 2019; Junco, 2012; Kirschner & Karpinski, 2010) because of their requirement for excessive multitasking, occupation of learning time, and poor effects on the development of students’ metacognition and online navigation skills, which might explain their negative effects on digital reading revealed by this study.

The mixed effects of the recreational use of ICT-based social media outside of school also furthered the understanding of the contradictory results of previous studies on the recreational use of ICT, which showed either positive effects (Hu et al., 2018; Skryabin et al., 2015) or negative effects (Petko et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2019) on students' reading performance. Since the derived variable ENTUSE used by the abovementioned studies covered a wider range of digital device use, including playing one-player games and downloading music, and since the items used to derive the variable ENTUSE increased from 10 to 12 from PISA 2012 to PISA 2015, such contradictory results might be due to the mixed effects of the diverse types of technology involved in these studies. This study, however, may provide a clearer picture for educators who seek to foster students’ digital reading skills by encouraging their engagement in specific social communication tools.

5.2. Academic use outside of school
Likewise, the effects of the academic use of ICT-based social media varied. An interesting finding was that whereas the effects of recreational use of SNSs were generally negative, the effects of the academic use of SNSs for communication with other students were positive from PISA 2009 to PISA 2018. This suggests that the impacts of a single type of social media were not fixed and could change when the purpose shifted. Such variation is explicable because it has been suggested that there is a difference between the use of SNSs for noneducational purposes and educational purposes (Lambic, 2016). In particular, such a difference might be due to the nature of the SNS platforms used for these two different purposes and their different technical functionalities—e.g., comments, posts and interactions on these different SNS platforms—which may vary in the affordance for digital reading. The past decade has witnessed the increasing functions of SNS for students to interact with their peers, and ICT as a mediating tool could prompt learning via communication, interaction, and collaboration (Zhang & Liu, 2016). Thus, the positive effects might be due to the advantages of collaborative learning. Psychologically, online collaboration among students could help students receive emotional support and foster their sense of belonging to the digital community, and communicative activities such as commenting might improve students’ engagement and motivation in digital reading tasks (Junco, 2012; Junco, Heiberger, & Loken, 2011; Manca & Ranieri, 2016). Intellectually, such peer cooperation could help students discover their own weaknesses and learn from students who perform better than them in particular subjects (Lambic, 2016), such as by explicitly discussing digital reading skills and thus achieving better digital reading scores.

In contrast, the findings from all the PISA cycles indicated that students who too frequently engaged in other types of schoolwork-related activities, including using emails to communicate with other students and using SNSs and email to communicate with teachers about schoolwork or to submit homework, were likely to perform worse in digital reading assessments. Since excessive academic online social communication might occupy students’ time to read voluntarily, it is speculated that the lack of leisure reading resulted in the lack of chance to develop the aforementioned reading skills that are essential for digital reading. In addition, notably, while the academic use of SNSs with peers facilitated digital reading, the academic use of SNSs with teachers hindered it. These findings resonate with those of Smith (2016) highlighting student-student interactions over faculty-student interactions via social media in undergraduate learning and providing empirical support for an emphasis on the student-centered approach over the teacher-centered approach in integrating social media into instruction. Since it was unknown whether frequent communication with teachers was voluntary or compulsory for the sample students in this study and since students were found to be more willing to join Facebook groups with students only and to sometimes feel uncomfortable in groups with teachers (Lambic, 2016), future studies could elucidate the differential effects of SNSs by exploring the psychological factors related to SNS group communication.

Based on the miscellaneous but relatively stable influential patterns of ICT-based social media use outside of school, strategies to improve adolescents' digital reading performance are posited. First, it is suggested that parents not only regulate adolescents' frequency of social media use at home but also supervise the particular purposes of social media use and types of social media being used to reduce the risks of excessive and distracting social media use. Second, educators are encouraged to make special efforts to raise students' awareness of the importance of staying focused on the beneficial types and purposes of social media use, to emphasize individuals' responsibility to regulate their digital reading activities and to provide relevant training if possible. For instance, students with weak self-regulating abilities might easily divert from the academic use of SNSs with peers to the recreational use of SNSs, transforming the positive effects to negative effects due to a lack of a sense of boundaries between different activities. As Dabbagh and Kitsantas (2012) warned, although students’ social media use could help create personal learning environments that valued their personal agency, successful learning requires students to master personal knowledge management skills, such as the ability to balance formal and informal contexts. Similarly, adequate guidance provided for students with different learning styles is needed (Jing, Li, Chen, Li, & Hu, 2015; Wei, Yang, Chen, & Hu, 2018). Third, it is imperative for teachers to reevaluate the necessity and quality of communicating with students via ICT-based social media outside of school and use SNSs with caution due to the adverse effects revealed in the present study; however, communication about schoolwork between students via SNSs could be encouraged for the development of their digital reading proficiency on the condition that guidance on self-regulating strategies is provided for students.

5.3. General use at school
The findings indicated that over the past decade, adolescents' frequent use of ICT-based social media at school, including chatting online and using email at school, was found to have negative effects on digital reading performance, which means that individuals participating in these activities frequently were likely to perform worse in the digital reading assessment than their peers who seldom did so. This result partly confirmed the findings of Xiao et al. (2019), Hu et al. (2018), Petko et al. (2017) and Skryabin et al. (2015) that students' technology use at school was negatively correlated with their PISA reading scores, and it went a step further to reveal the particular effects of ICT-based social media use at school on digital reading performance. These effects might be explained by the fact that unlike students’ use of email or engagement in chatting in their spare time, their excessive use of these ICT-based social media platforms at school might occupy their time that they could have used to focus on studying and might distract their attention from classes (Levine, Waite, & Bowman, 2007), especially in classes involving digital reading activities in this case, resulting in poor digital reading performance.

Nevertheless, although the school median frequency of students' use of ICT-based social media was also found to impose negative effects on students' digital reading performance in PISA 2009 and PISA 2015, a curious finding of PISA 2018 was that for students studying in schools in which the overall frequency of students' use of ICT-based social media was high, their digital reading scores were also higher, which was different from the findings of Hu et al. (2018) that school-level ICT use negatively influenced students' reading performance. It can be assumed that recently in schools where the overall frequency of social media use was high, their use might occur under the supervision and guidance of teachers, thus reducing academic distractions (Andersson et al., 2014). However, due to the lack of information about students' purposes for using ICT-based social media at school and teachers’ pedagogical use of social media in this study, such variations in the student- and school-level results and such contrast across years call for further empirical studies; future studies could distinguish recreational use from academic use and voluntary use from assigned use in the formal learning environment and determine their relevant impacts on digital reading performance to identify the optimal practices of technology-assisted learning (Hu, 2014) and the interface between formal and informal learning with social media as a pedagogical tool.

5.4. Attitude towards ICT-based social media
ICT-based social media attitudes at the student level were found to have significant positive correlations with digital reading performance ever since such information was available in PISA 2015, and the school-level attitude in PISA 2018 showed positive effects as well, indicating that students who perceived social media to be useful and students whose peers at the same school generally believed in the utility of social media tended to perform better in the digital reading assessment and that a mild change in students’ negative attitudes towards ICT-based social media could result in marked increases in their digital reading scores. This finding on the attitudinal factor of social media is novel, although it was partly consistent with findings of previous studies showing that having a positive attitude towards ICT helped students attain better digital reading scores (Lim & Jung, 2019) and traditional reading scores (Hu et al., 2018; Petko et al., 2017). One possible reason is that students with positive attitudes may become more active participants in online reading activities (Lee & Wu, 2012) and may use ICT-based social media more frequently (Ali et al., 2018; Lambic, 2016; Owusu et al., 2019) than those with negative attitudes. The findings on social media use in this study suggest that students with positive attitudes might engage more frequently in activities that improve digital reading performance and consequently might perform better in digital reading tasks. However, further analysis, such as a mediation model, is needed to reveal the interaction between ICT-based social media attitudes, ICT-based social media use, and digital reading performance.

Generally, the significance of the attitudinal factor over time suggests that to help students become better digital readers, educators should place more emphasis on increasing students' awareness of the usefulness of ICT-based social media and on engaging students in positive experiences of digital reading activities on online social platforms. For instance, using social media for character journaling, a pedagogical strategy devised by White and Hungerford-Kresser (2014), was found to increase students' interests and engage students in a collaborative online forum through which students could become active readers and participate in meaning-making and meaning-negotiation activities with abundant digital texts. Generally, as Petko et al. (2017) noted, “it might be quality instead of quantity of educational technology use that matters” (p. 1070), and generating adolescents’ positive attitudes towards ICT-based social media might be a beneficial and efficient way to improve their digital reading performance.

6. Conclusion
This study investigated the effects of ICT-based social media use and attitude on adolescents’ digital reading performance while tracking the changes in the effects on generations over nine years. In analyzing data from 767,511 15-year-old students from PISA 2009 to PISA 2018, findings from the HLM indicated the generally positive effects of recreational use of social media outside of school, the generally negative effects of academic use outside of school and use at school, as well as the significantly positive effects of perceived usefulness of social media. Moreover, such effects remained steady, as demonstrated by the relatively stable influential patterns within the recent decade, and the relevance of the social media factors investigated in the present study increased over the last decade.

This study has made several contributions. First, it added to previous studies by adopting a longitudinal view to investigate the effects of ICT-based social media on digital reading performance over time. The HLM on the four recent PISA cycles that conducted digital reading assessment, i.e., PISA 2009, PISA 2012, PISA 2015 and PISA 2018, enabled the identification of the stability and flexibility of the effects over nearly a decade. Compared with previous annual cross-sectional studies, the findings of this study could help further the understanding of the influence of social media from a dynamic perspective and guide teachers and policy makers to regulate digital reading education in the long run. Second, compared with previous studies, most of which focused on social media use only at the student level, this study conducted a more comprehensive investigation of behavioral and attitudinal factors related to ICT-based social media, with the student-, school-, and country-level variables taken into consideration. It is hoped that the results based on quality data and multilevel variables will provide thorough insights into the relationship between ICT-based social media and adolescents’ digital reading performance and provoke efficient educational practices, especially in the era that witnessed the increasingly important role of social media in boosting digital reading performance and in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era when social media users and digital readers will potentially be on the rise.

The present study is not without limitations in several regards, which future research could endeavor to improve. First, although this study has gone a step further than previous studies in exploring the trend of the effects of social media on digital reading performance by utilizing data from all four available PISA cycles, the items used in the current PISA background questionnaires are still limited. Consequently, the present study could not investigate the impacts of attitudinal factors for a longer period. In the same vein, the lack of items addressing the exact nature of students' social media use other than use frequency made the investigation of the effects of specific activities on social communication platforms (Matzat & Vrieling, 2016) and the specific purposes of social media use at school impossible to examine. It should be noted that such operationalization of ICT-based social media use provided in the PISA questionnaires might affect the generalization of the conclusions. In addition, students' choices of SNS platform for different purposes could be investigated further to disclose the effects on digital reading performance. Thus, it would be worthwhile to explore such potential impacts by obtaining relevant data through longitudinal field research, which could provide more details to shed light on the relationship between social media and digital reading performance. In addition, while “teachers can act as intermediaries between students' social media use and outcomes” (Matzat & Vrieling, 2016, p. 74) and are potential impact factors of reading performance (Chen, Zhang, & Hu, 2021), due to the design of the PISA sampling procedure, teacher-related factors could not be used in the multilevel model adopted in this study and more empirical studies are needed in this regard. Second, the possible interaction between social media use and attitude was not explored due to the complexity of the multilevel variables used in the models, suggesting that further analysis, such as a mediation model, could be conducted in this field to provide a more comprehensive picture of the effects of ICT-based social media on adolescents’ digital reading performance. Last, since the present study involved a secondary analysis of the PISA database, considering the deficiencies pertaining to the scale reliability of PISA questionnaire data, it is important that researchers are aware of the possible limitations of the data, whereas generally, as Rutkowski and Rutkowski (2010) point out, the carefully collected data “have worth for developing and validating educational theories” and “informing policy and reform debates” (p. 426).
