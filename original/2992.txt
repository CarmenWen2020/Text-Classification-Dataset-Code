An important function of positive emotional design is protecting learning from negative impacts by promoting self-regulation. The present study examines the effects of the emotional design principle in the situation of ego depletion, which reflects a period of self-regulation failure due to a lack of mental resources. Based on a sample of 120 students from a Chinese university, two groups of participants divided into depletion and non-depletion conditions first received different self-regulation manipulations, and then attended a multimedia lesson, with either a positive emotional design or a neutral emotional design. It was found that learning with positive emotional design materials alleviated the decrease in the transfer performance of the depletion group by preventing cognitive overload. These results are consistent with the proposition that implementing an emotional design approach can prevent the impairment of learning. The results also provide preliminary evidence for the assumption that learners' affective states may impact the consumption of their mental resources, and, in turn, affect cognitive load. Additional implications for the role of learners’ affective states in cognitive load are discussed.

1. Introduction
Emotional design has been defined as “the use of a range of design features with the goal to impact learners' emotions to enhance learning” (Plass & Kaplan, 2016, p. 138). In accordance with the emotional design hypothesis (Um, Plass, Hayward, & Homer, 2012), adding features, such as face-like shapes and warm colors in multimedia classes, can facilitate learning performance by inducing learners' positive affective-motivation state. This hypothesis has been widely inspected but has yielded mixed results. A number of studies have indicated that implementing an emotional design approach can increase positive affective-motivational states, diminish task difficulty, and facilitate learning performance in students (Brom, Stárková, & D’Mello, 2018; Le et al., 2018; Mayer & Estrella, 2014; Peng et al., 2021; Plass et al., 2020, 2014; Shangguan, Gong, Guo, Wang, & Lu, 2020; Um et al., 2012; Uzun & Yıldırım, 2018; Wong & Adesope, 2020). However, others have reported contradictory results; finding that using such a design approach (i.e., facial-like shapes and warm colors) does not induce learners’ positive affective-motivational states or promote learning outcomes (e.g., Münchow & Bannert, 2019; Park, Knörzer, Plass, & Brünken, 2015; Stárková, Lukavský, Javora, & Brom, 2019). Furthermore, Stárková et al. (2019) posit that the emotional design approach may only have a “small and fragile” effect, and may not provide benefits in all contexts.

However, there is a gap in the body of knowledge, as most of these studies have focused on the direct influence of the emotional design approach on learners’ positive affective states and learning outcomes. By contrast, the indirect effects of the emotional design approach, such as preventing learners from negative impacts, have been overlooked. For example, Plass and Kaplan (2016) propose that a major function of the emotional design approach is to maintain efficient self-regulation processes during learning, thereby avoiding a decline in learning performance. To test this assumption, the current research investigates the effect of using the principle of emotional design (Um et al., 2012) in situations of ego depletion. Ego depletion has been defined as a state of self-regulation failure caused by a temporary reduction in available mental resources (Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, & Tice, 1998), which has detrimental effects on intellectual performance (Englert & Bertrams, 2017; Schmeichel, Vohs, & Baumeister, 2003). Considering the negative impact of ego depletion on learning and the potential positive effect of the emotional design approach, we test whether using positive emotional design elements could prevent the learning impairment caused by mental resource depletion (ego depletion), and thus promote learning performance.

1.1. Theoretical background
The definition of “emotion” in emotional design research is derived from Russell's (2003) core affect theory, which refers to “a neurophysiological state that is consciously accessible as a simple non-reflective feeling” (p.147). Following this definition, most related studies focus on the valence of learners' affect (positive-negative) rather than specific emotions (e.g., Plass & Kaplan, 2016; Um et al., 2012), and the terms “emotion” and “affect” are used interchangeably.

Emotional design research is largely based on the Cognitive Affective Theory of Learning with Media (CATLM, Moreno, 2006; Moreno & Mayer, 2007), which incorporates affective and motivational factors into the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML; Mayer, 2005). According to the CTML, individuals select, organize, and integrate information with previously stored information in their long-term memory. The CATLM further proposes that learners’ affective-motivational states influence the degree of cognitive engagement, and that self-regulation processes regulate cognitive and affective processes during learning.

Based on these two theories, the Integrated Cognitive-Affective Model of Learning with Multimedia (ICALM; Plass & Kaplan, 2016) assumes that the processes of emotion and cognition influence each other, and that their interaction continues to consume learners' limited mental resources throughout the learning process. Plass and Kalyuga (2019, p.342) further propose that “learning happens in a sequence of local learning episodes that have a cumulative effect.” That is, the consumption of mental resources in a learning episode may disrupt subsequent learning episodes (e.g., the depletion effects). Furthermore, learners' affective states can alter cognitive processes in a learning episode by accelerating or decelerating the consumption of learners’ mental resources and impact subsequent learning episodes.

The notion of the cumulative effect (Plass & Kalyuga, 2019) can be linked to the recent extension of the Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) (Sweller, van Merriënboer, & Paas, 2019). One of the most influential theories in the field of education, it assumes that knowledge acquisition depends on how efficiently individuals use their limited mental resources (Sweller, Ayres, & Kalyuga, 2011). According to CLT, learning will be hampered if the overall cognitive load exceeds individuals’ mental resources (cognitive overload). In a recent adjustment of CLT (Kalyuga, 2011), overall cognitive load is determined by two components. Intrinsic load is defined as the load required for achieving specific learning goals. It is associated with all cognitive activities that contribute to knowledge acquisition. Extraneous load refers to the load that does not directly contribute to learning. It is evoked by inappropriate instructional design. CLT also includes germane load (the load evoked by the effortful construction and automation of organized knowledge structures or schemas), but this facet is excluded from the new model because it is essentially indistinguishable from intrinsic load (de Jong, 2010; Kalyuga, 2011).

An implicit assumption of traditional CLT is that individuals' mental resources (i.e., working memory capacity) are fixed (de Jong, 2010). However, the latest findings suggest that learners' mental resources decline following cognitive effort investment. Specifically, the resource depletion assumption indicates that learners' mental resources become depleted after a period of cognitive effort investment during learning (Chen, Castro-Alonso, Paas, & Sweller, 2018; Leahy & Sweller, 2019; Sweller et al., 2019). With the depletion of mental resources, learners’ free cognitive resources (i.e., the difference between total cognitive load and remaining mental resources) fall toward zero, which means that learners may experience a high cognitive load or overload in a subsequent task.

1.2. Effects of emotional design in multimedia learning
Emotional design has been defined as the design feature that seeks to influence learners' emotions to promote learning, including how information is presented or the interactions in learning environments (Plass & Kaplan, 2016). This study focuses on the emotional design approach through visual information representation (i.e., colors and shapes), which assumes that using bright warm colors and facial-like shapes in multimedia instruction improve learning by elevating learners' positive affective-motivational states (Um et al., 2012). Compared with interaction design methods (e.g., game-based learning and animated pedagogical agents), using visual design features is more convenient and easier to popularize. Using such a design approach, research can induce learners’ positive affective states without adding content irrelevant to the learning purpose (Plass, Heidig, Hayward, Homer, & Um, 2014; Um et al., 2012).

Um et al. (2012) investigate the extent to which emotional design can induce positive emotions. They find that redesigning the key elements in a multimedia lesson with round shapes and bright warm colors can induce positive emotions, reduce cognitive load (perceived task difficulty), and facilitate comprehension and transfer performance. The benefits of including an emotional design approach in multimedia learning have been replicated by several follow-up studies (for a review and meta-analysis, see Brom et al., 2018; Wong & Adesope, 2020). These findings thus provide empirical evidence for the emotion facilitate learning hypothesis and the CATLM (Moreno, 2006; Moreno & Mayer, 2007).

Although the benefits of including the emotional design approach in learning have been replicated by research, the results are mixed. Some studies find that emotional design does not successfully enhance learners’ positive emotions (Münchow, Mengelkamp, & Bannert, 2017; Park et al., 2015) or promote learning performance (Knörzer, Brünken, & Park, 2016; Münchow & Bannert, 2019; Stárková et al., 2019). Several explanations have been presented to explain these inconsistent results. For example, Stárková et al. (2019) indicate that cultural differences may reduce the effect of emotional design. The results of two recent meta-analyses (Brom et al., 2018; Wong & Adesope, 2020) indicate that the effect of emotional design is moderated by diverse factors, such as age, instruction time, language/culture, and learning domain.

As mentioned above, most previous studies have centered on the direct influence of the emotional design approach on learners’ positive affective-motivational states and learning outcomes. The indirect effects of the emotional design approach, such as preventing learners from suffering negative impacts (e.g., negative emotions), have been somewhat overlooked. Considering the hindrance of negative emotion to learning performance (Pekrun, 2006), Plass and Kaplan (2016, p.145) posit that “an important function of emotional design is to minimize the likelihood of negative emotions and promote self-regulation when they appear,” which is also consistent with the proposition that “learning is best supported by preventing states that might negatively affect learning” (Sweller et al., 2019, p. 285). A related mechanism by which emotional design can prevent the impairment of learning is the inhibition and reduction of performance-avoidance goals which are positively associated with negative emotions, such as anxiety, frustration, and shame (Pekrun et al., 2006; Plass & Kaplan, 2016).

Although no direct empirical evidence supports the prediction that emotional design can prevent the impairment of learning, the findings of emotional design research provide some clues. For instance, Münchow et al. (2017) found that a higher level of negative emotions before learning results in a decrease in comprehension when participants receive neutral emotional design materials, whereas no such effect occurs when participants learn with positive emotional design materials. Münchow and Bannert (2019) show that learners retain positive emotions at the beginning of a learning task (about 10 min) when receiving positive emotional design materials, whereas positive emotions continuously decrease throughout the learning process in the group receiving neutral emotional design materials. Endres, Weyreter, Renkl, and Eitel (2020) found that the benefits of positive emotional design can only be detected in the later phases of studying in a prolonged study situation (16 min), which indicates that a positive emotional design method helps the learner maintain cognitive engagement, and therefore fosters sustained learning.

The assumption that emotional design protects learning from negative impacts can also be supported by a large number of studies that show that using the emotional design approach can effectively reduce learners' evaluation of task difficulty (for a review and meta-analysis, see Brom et al., 2018; Wong & Adesope, 2020). Considering the relationship between perceived task difficulty and cognitive load (de Jong, 2010; DeLeeuw & Mayer, 2008), these results suggest that learning with positive emotional design materials may reduce the perception of cognitive load during learning, and result in less effort investment (Raaijmakers, Baars, Schaap, Paas, & van Gog, 2017; Venables & Fairclough, 2009). Such a result is at odds with the assumption of CATLM (positive emotion increases cognitive effort), but it can be explained by the resource depletion assumption of cognitive load theory (Chen et al., 2018; Sweller et al., 2019) and the ICALM (Plass & Kalyuga, 2019). The benefits of the emotional design approach may be due to the higher cognitive load evoked by neutral design materials, rather than the strength of the emotional design itself. In other words, learning with neutral emotional design material accelerates the consumption of learners’ mental resources and thereby evokes cognitive overload. The emotional design approach may protect learning by reducing cognitive load, rather than increasing effort investment.

1.3. Ego depletion and the resource model of self-regulation
Self-regulation has been defined as “the ability to change oneself and exert control over one's inner processes” (Baumeister & Vohs, 2004, p.xi). Successful self-regulation can help people adapt to environment challenges and achieve academic success (Duckworth, Taxer, Eskreis-winkler, Galla, & Gross, 2019). The resource model of self-regulation is based on the idea that self-regulation demands individuals' limited mental resources (Baumeister et al., 1998). As the availability of mental resources is exhausted, a certain period of time is required to recover, when self-regulation failure may occur. Baumeister and colleagues (e.g., Baumeister, 2014) have used the term “ego depletion” to describe the failure of self-regulation and impaired task performance during this recovery period.

The ego depletion effect has been widely investigated using the sequential task paradigm (e.g., Baumeister et al., 1998). Participants first perform a task (e.g., Stroop, thought suppression) that requires self-regulation, then complete an unrelated task that also requires self-regulation (e.g., learning). Once the ego depletion effect is induced by the first task, the participants in the depletion condition perform worse than non-depletion participants in the second task. Using the sequential task paradigm, researchers have widely examined and confirmed the ego depletion effect on different occasions (e.g., Dang et al., 2021; Sjåstad & Baumeister, 2018; Tsai & Li, 2020; for a review and meta-analysis, see; Hagger, Wood, Stiff, & Chatzisarantis, 2010; Dang, 2018).

The literature shows that the ego depletion effect negatively impacts learning performance as well (Englert & Bertrams, 2017; Price & Yates, 2010, 2015; Schmeichel et al., 2003). For example, Schmeichel et al. (2003) found that depleted participants reported more task demand and performed worse on a GRE reasoning test than participants in the non-depletion condition. Englert and Bertrams (2017) reported that secondary school students with temporary depletion underperform in a retention task compared with non-depletion students. They argue that the ego depletion effect impairs learners’ attention regulation and persistent elaboration, thereby negatively affecting learning performance.

Motivational and affective factors are thought to play critical roles to attenuate the resource depletion effect (Baumeister, 2014; Inzlicht, Schmeichel, & Macrae, 2014; Sun, Wu, & Chen, 2019). According to the motivation and limited resources explanation (Baumeister, 2014; Hagger 2010), people do not really exhaust all their mental resources. In fact, to save the remaining resources, they may no longer invest mental resources in subsequent tasks, thus leading to self-regulation failure on these tasks (Muraven, Shmueli, & Burkley, 2006). Hence, if the subsequent task has a higher priority and individuals are motivated to complete it, they may continue to invest their remaining mental resources, and thus self-regulate effectively, even in a depleted state. For instance, offering a cash incentive (Stewart, Wright, Azor Hui, & Simmons, 2009) or making participants believe that the subsequent task is important to others or themselves (Muraven & Slessareva, 2003) can help maintain their performance on a subsequent task, even in a depleted state.

Empirical evidence has also shown that the impairment of the resource depletion effect can be reversed if the participant is in a positive affective state (Ren, Hu, Zhang, & Huang, 2010; Tice, Baumeister, Shmueli, & Muraven, 2007; Vanco & Christensen, 2016). For example, Vanco and Christensen (2016) found that depletion participants report higher levels of enjoyment in an entertainment-education instruction, and obtain higher scores on a subsequent test. Considering its intrinsically aversive nature (Hagger et al., 2010), the self-regulation process itself may induce negative feelings (e.g., Leith & Baumeister, 1996; Tice, Bratslavsky, & Baumeister, 2001). To cope with these negative feelings, people tend to seek enjoyment (Inzlicht et al., 2014). If the subsequent tasks do not meet this demand (i.e., seeking out enjoyment), the negative emotion can accelerate the consumption of the remaining mental resources (Gendolla, 2000; Gendolla & Richter, 2010; Kreibig, Gendolla, & Scherer, 2010), thereby leading to the ego depletion effect. On the contrary, if the subsequent task meets the goal of providing enjoyment, the impairment of the ego depletion effect is counteracted or even reversed.

1.4. The present study and hypotheses
Considering the positive effect of the emotional design approach on learners’ affective-motivational states, using it in a multimedia lesson could attenuate the impairment of the ego depletion effect on learning performance by reducing the cognitive load, thus protecting the learning performance from decline. Hence, in this study, we compared the effectiveness of the emotional design approach (positive emotional design vs. neutral emotional design) in both depletion (insufficient mental resources) and non-depletion (sufficient mental resources) conditions to explain the underlying mechanism of the emotional design principle and provide empirical evidence for the ICALM and the depletion assumption of CLT.

The following research hypotheses are, therefore, proposed:

Hypothesis 1

Compared with neutral emotional design materials, learning with positive emotional design materials should increase learners' positive emotions and/or decrease negative emotions, and such a difference should be more apparent in the depletion condition than in the non-depletion condition.

Hypothesis 2

Participants in the depletion condition should experience higher cognitive load than those in the non-depletion condition. Learning with positive emotional design materials should reduce cognitive load (intrinsic and extraneous load) to a relatively low level, especially in the depletion condition.

Hypothesis 3

Learning performance (retention and transfer) should be worse in the depletion condition than in the non-depletion condition, whereas, learning with positive emotional design materials should attenuate such an impairment.

Hypothesis 4

Participants cannot maintain self-regulation strength in the depletion condition compared with the non-depletion condition, while learning with positive emotional design materials should help learners to maintain self-regulation, even in the depletion condition.

2. Method
2.1. Participants and research design
A total of 120 college students (including 48 men and 72 women) from a university in eastern China were recruited and completed the experiment. The average age of the participants was 18.39 years (SD = 0.61). All the participants were unaware of the purpose of the study and each participant received RMB 50. The experiment was conducted in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki standards of the author's University Committee on Human Research Ethics.

This experiment adopted a 2 (depletion vs. no depletion) × 2 (neutral emotional design vs. positive emotional design) between-subjects design. The participants were randomly assigned to one of these four conditions: depletion neutral emotional design (DN), depletion positive emotional design (DP), non-depletion neutral emotional design (NN), and non-depleted positive emotional design (NP). There were 30 participants in each condition.

2.2. Depleting task
A color-word Stroop task was selected as the depleting task in this experiment. Studies have demonstrated that inhibiting the Stroop effect of color-word deviation requires the consumption of individuals' limited mental resources and induces the ego depletion effect (Dang, 2018). The task was programmed and run using E-prime 2.0 and presented on a 24-inch LCD with a resolution of 1920 × 1080 pixels. On each trial, one of four Chinese words, namely “红(red),” “绿(green),” “蓝(blue),” and “黄(yellow),” was presented on a black background and the color of the word was randomly chosen from four alternatives: red, green, blue, and yellow. Each trial started with a fixation point in the center of the screen for 500 ms. After this fixation, one word was presented for a duration of 200 ms. Then, this word disappeared and the participant was required to report the color of the word as quickly and accurately as possible (pressing “J” for yellow or blue and, “F” for red or green). To ensure that all participants finished the Stroop task in the same duration, a blank screen was presented for a duration of 2300 ms minus participants’ response time. Thus, the duration of each trial was fixed at 3000 ms. The experiment incorporated a 1 min long practice period (20 trials) before the formal task. The formal task consisted of 200 trials and lasted 10 min, where 30% of the trials were color-word congruent and 70% were color-word incongruent.

2.3. Learning material
The learning material incorporated text, pictures, and narrative to introduce the influenza virus. The multimedia lesson was controlled by the system and presented by a desktop computer for about 6 min. There were two versions of learning materials (i.e., positive and neutral emotional design versions). The visual elements in the positive emotional design (Fig. 1 left) were specifically designed (i.e., warm colors and face-like shapes) on the basis of the emotional design principle (Um et al., 2012). Red color was adopted in this study because in Chinese culture, red is associated with positive social events and objects (e.g., Hurlbert & Ling, 2007). Therefore, using red can trigger positive emotions in Chinese populations (Wang, Shu, & Mo, 2014). One should note that such an effect may not be generalized to other cultures. The visual elements in the neutral emotional design (Fig. 1 right) were not specifically designed (i.e., monochromatic grayscale without anthropomorphic figures). There were no other differences between these two versions.

2.4. Measures
Prior knowledge about the experimental task was measured using a 10-item self-report checklist in which participants indicated how much they knew about the influenza virus. (e.g., “I know the meaning of ‘H’ and ‘N’ in H5N1 virus”). The checklist using a five-point Likert scale (1 = totally disagree, 5 = totally agree). The final score comprised the averages of the 10 items. A similar prior-knowledge checklist is often used in studies with short instructional time to prevent a question effect that can direct the participant's attention during subsequent learning tasks (Mayer & Estrella, 2014). The Cronbach's α value was 0.93, which indicates the questionnaire's strong internal consistency (Taber, 2018). The analysis did not reveal statistically significant differences among different conditions (all ps > 0.29). Thus, prior-knowledge was not included in further analyses.

Affective state was measured using the 20 items Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988). The participants responded on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (very slightly) to 5 (very much). Each item measured a positive/negative emotion. The Cronbach's α values were 0.89 for PANAS 1 (PANAS score after the depleting task) and 0.88 for PANAS 2 (PANAS score after the learning task), thereby indicating the questionnaire's reliable internal consistency (Taber, 2018).

Cognitive load was measured using a 20-item cognitive load questionnaire (Leppink et al., 2013, 2014), which was designed to measure different types of cognitive load. It is clear that emotional design can reduce overall cognitive load during learning. However, it is still unclear how it affects different components of cognitive load. For example, it is possible that the emotional design approach attracts attention and merely reduces extraneous load through the special colors and shapes. This study examined the effect of emotional design on different cognitive components (i.e., intrinsic load and extraneous load). For example, the item: “The topics covered in the lecture were very complex,” was designed to assess intrinsic cognitive load. The item: “The instructions and explanations during the lecture were very unclear,” was designed to assess extraneous cognitive load. The participants responded to each of the questions on an 11-point scale (0 = not at all the case, 10 = completely the case). Cronbach's α values were 0.84 (intrinsic load) and 0.86 (extraneous load), thus indicating the reliable internal consistency of the questionnaire.

Learning performance was measured using retention and transfer tests. Both of the tests are most commonly used in multimedia learning research to evaluate whether learning instruction can facilitate meaningful learning (Mayer, 2014). The retention test included 15 multiple-choice questions (e.g., The structure of the influenza virus includes which of the following parts?). The participants received one point for answering a question correctly, and the final score ranged from 0 to 15 points. The transfer test included four questions (e.g., Please explain how flu drugs work). The participants received one point for each acceptable answer on each of the four questions. The final score was derived by adding the points received for all acceptable answers. Two independent raters rated the transfer score, and disputes were addressed in discussions. The Cronbach's α values were 0.70 for the retention test and 0.61 for the transfer test. The relatively lower alphas (0.61–0.70) are still acceptable in this study because testing a range of distinct knowledge in science education should not be expected to produce high alphas (Berger & Hänze, 2015; Bretz & McClary, 2015; Nehring, Nowak, zu Belzen, & Tiemann, 2015).

Self-regulation was measured through participants' cardiovascular activity (i.e., heart rate variability), which has been demonstrated as a valid biomarker for evaluating self-regulation strength (for a review and meta-analysis, see Holzman & Bridgett, 2017; Zahn et al., 2016). In this study, heart rate variability (HRV) was calculated using the root mean squared successive differences (RMSSD) in the inter-beat interval (e.g., Segerstrom & Nes, 2007; Task Force, 1996). The root mean squared successive differences (RMSSD) of inter-beat intervals was conducted as an index to evaluate learners’ self-regulation strength. RMSSD is a widely used time-domain measure of heart rate variability, which mainly reflects parasympathetic influence (Task Force, 1996; Porges, 2007). Research has shown that RMSSD levels are elevated with better self-regulation, and that a higher RMSSD level is often associated with better task performance (Backs & Seljos, 1994; Cowley, Ravaja, & Heikura, 2013; Geisler, Kleinfeldt, & Kubiak, 2016; Segerstrom & Nes, 2007).

Electrocardiograms (ECG) of the participants were recorded using a BIOPAC MP-160 system with Acqknowledge software at a sampling rate of 500 Hz. The signal was collected with two electrodes placed on the left and right mid-clavicles, and a ground on the lowest left rib. First, the ECG data were manually inspected to ensure the correct identification of each heartbeat. Then the data judged as artifacts (intervals differing by more than 20% from the previous interval) were replaced by interpolation (Task Force, 1996). Kubios HRV software was used for heart rate variability analysis and natural logarithm transformed data were employed.

2.5. Procedure
The experiment was carried out on a desktop computer and lasted for approximately 45 min (Fig. 2). After providing informed consent for the study, participants completed questionnaires regarding demographic information and prior knowledge. Next, the experimenter attached the ECG electrodes to participants. Before the learning task, participants assigned to the depletion condition completed the Stroop task for approximately 10 min, while participants in the non-depletion condition sat quietly, watching an emotionally neutral film fragment (the documentary The March of the Penguins) at the same time (e.g., Talamini, Bringmann, de Boer, & Hofman, 2013; Vlemincx, Taelman, Peuter, & Diest, 2011). After finishing the manipulation tasks (Stroop task and watching the movie), participants completed the first PANAS questionnaire (PAS 1 and NAS 1). Then, the learning materials were presented to participants for about 6 min. The ECG data of each participant were recorded and computed to gain the RMSSD values for the manipulation task (RMSSD 1) and learning task (RMSSD 2). After the learning task, the participants were asked to complete the questionnaires related to positive and negative emotions (PAS 2 and NAS 2), cognitive load, and then the retention and transform tests. They took about 25 min to complete these questionnaires and tests.

3.1. Positive and negative emotions
The self-evaluations of positive and negative emotions reported after the learning task (PAS 2 and NAS 2) were subjected to a 2 × 2 MANCOVA, with the positive and negative scores before learning (PAS 1 and NAS 1) as the covariates. The results indicated a significant main effect of design, Wilks' Lambda = 0.95, F (2, 113) = 3.25, p = 0.04, 
 = 0.05. There was no main effect of depletion, Wilks' Lambda = 0.99, F (2, 113) = 0.40, p = 0.71,
 < 0.01, and no significant interaction effect, Wilks’ Lambda = 0.98, F (2, 115) = 1.01, p = 0.37, 
 = 0.02.

The between-subject effects reported by MANCOVA on PAS 2 revealed a marginally significant main effect of design, F (1, 114) = 3.55, p = 0.06, 
 = 0.03, thus indicating that learning with positive design materials somewhat induces positive emotions. There was no main effect of depletion, F (1, 114) = 0.57, p = 0.45,
 = 0.01, and no significant interaction effect, F (1, 114) = 0.42, p = 0.52, 
 < 0.01.

The between-subject effects reported by MANCOVA on NAS 2 revealed a significant main effect of design, F (1, 114) = 4.10, p = 0.05, 
 = 0.03, indicating that learning with positive emotional design material could reduce negative emotions during learning. Consistent with our prediction, there was no main effect of depletion, F (1, 114) < 0.01, p = 0.95, 
 < 0.01, and no significant interaction effect, F (1, 114) = 1.55, p = 0.25, 
 = 0.01.

3.2. Cognitive load
The perceived intrinsic and extraneous load were analyzed using a 2 × 2 MANOVA (see Fig. 3). The results revealed a significant main effect of depletion, Wilks' Lambda = 0.92, F (2, 115) = 5.06, p = 0.008, 
 = 0.08, and design, Wilks' Lambda = 0.90 F (2,115) = 6.39, p = 0.002, 
 = 0.10. The interaction effect was not significant, Wilks’ Lambda = 0.97, F (2, 115) = 1.80, p = 0.17, 
 = 0.30.

Fig. 3. Means and standard deviations of the perceived intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load: NN = non-depletion neutral design; DN = depletion neutral design; NP = non-depletion positive design; DP = depletion positive design; **p < 0.01.

The between-subject effects reported by MANOVA on intrinsic load revealed a significant main effect of depletion, F (1, 116) = 10.14, p = 0.002, 
 = 0.08, as well as design, F (1, 116) = 10.99, p = 0.001, 
 = 0.10. The results also revealed a marginally significant interaction effect between depletion and design, F (1,116) = 7.93, p = 0.06, 
 = 0.03. Post hoc t-tests (Fig. 2A) showed that the intrinsic load in the DN condition was significantly higher than the DP condition, t (58) = 3.01, p = 0.004, Cohen's d = 0.78, and the NN condition, t (58) = 3.50, p = 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.74. These results support the hypothesis that learning with positive emotional designed materials maintain the intrinsic load to a relatively lower level, especially in the depletion condition.

The between-subject effects reported by MANOVA on extraneous load revealed a significant main effect of design, F (1, 116) = 8.05, p = 0.005, 
 = 0.07 (Fig. 2B), which indicates that learning with positive emotional designed material could reduce the extraneous load. There was no main effect of depletion, F (1, 116) = 2.93, p = 0.17, 
 = 0.02, and no significant interaction effect, F (1, 116) = 1.01, p = 0.32, 
 = 0.01.

3.3. Learning performance
The scores on the retention and transfer tests were analyzed using a 2 × 2 MANOVA. The results indicated a significant main effect of depletion, Wilks' Lambda = 0.90, F (2, 115) = 6.97, p = 0.001, 
 = 0.11. There was no main effect of design, Wilks' Lambda = 0.97, F (2, 115) = 1.80, p = 0.17, 
 = 0.03, and no significant interaction effect, Wilks’ Lambda = 0.99, F (2, 115) = 0.36, p = 0.70, 
 = 0.01.

Inconsistent with our hypothesis, the between-subject effects reported by MANOVA on retention test revealed no main effect of depletion, F (1, 116) = 1.63, p = 0.20, 
 = 0.01, or design, F (1, 116) = 2.41, p = 0.61, 
 < 0.01, and no significant effect of the interaction, F (1, 116) = 0.32, p = 0.57, 
 < 0.01. There was no significant difference in retention performance between the different conditions.

Partially supporting our hypothesis, the between-subject effects reported by MANOVA on transfer test revealed a significant main effect of depletion, F (1, 116) = 13.39, p < 0.001 
 = 0.10, thus indicating that participants in the non-depletion condition outperformed those in the depletion condition on the transfer test. The analysis also revealed a marginally significant main effect of design, F (1,116) = 3.40, p = 0.075, 
 = 0.03, indicating that participants who learned with positive emotional design materials outperformed their counterparts in the neutral design condition in the transfer test. There was no significant interaction between design and depletion, F (1, 116) = 0.82, p = 0.37, 
 = 0.01.

3.4. Self-regulation
In this study, ECG data were recorded to reflect participants’ self-regulation strength. Four participants were excluded from the RMSSD analysis because of a high proportion of artifacts (more than 5%) and equipment failures. The RMSSD level during learning (RMSSD 2) were analyzed by a 2 × 2 ANCOVA with RMSSD 1 as a covariate. Partially supporting our hypothesis, the analysis revealed a significant main effect of depletion, F (1, 111) = 8.06, p = 0.005, 
 = 0.07, thereby indicating that participants in the non-depletion condition had higher RMSSD levels than those in the depletion condition. The results also revealed a marginally significant main effect on design, F (1, 111) = 3.55, p = 0.06, 
 = 0.03, thus indicating that participants who learned with positive emotional design materials had higher RMSSD than those in the neutral emotional design condition. There was no interaction between design and depletion, F (1,111) = 0.35, p = 0.55, 
 < 0.01. Considering that a higher RMSSD reflects better self-regulation (e.g., Segerstom & Nes, 2007), the present results can be interpreted as the ego depletion effect impairing self-regulation, while learning with emotional design materials helps to maintain self-regulation.

3.5. Moderated mediation analyses
a 0 = non-depletion, 1 = depletion; b 0 = neutral emotional design, 1 = positive emotional design.

The analysis showed that ego depletion had a negative direct effect on the transfer score, β = −1.63, SE = 0.55, p < 0.001. Depletion also positively predicted intrinsic load, β = 1.37, SE = 0.38, p < 0.01, which in turn negatively predicted the transfer test score, β = −0.33, SE = 0.17, p = 0.06. Moreover, the indirect effect of depletion on the transfer score through intrinsic load varied across the design conditions. Using 5000 bootstrap resamples, a significant conditional indirect effect was observed in the neutral emotional design condition, β = −0.45，CI = −1.03 to −0.07. However, no such effect was noted in the positive design condition,β = −0.11，CI = −0.56 to 0.08. Participants in the depletion condition who learned with neutral design materials reported higher levels of intrinsic load and subsequently performed worse on the transfer test. This pattern was not observed in the emotional design condition. Regardless of whether they were depleted, participants who learned using positive emotional design materials reported lower intrinsic load.

The full model explained 12.4% of the variance in the transfer test score, R2 = 0.124，F (2, 117) = 8.46, p < 0.001. These results support the assumption that learning with positive emotional design material can reduce the negative impact of ego depletion on transfer performance by avoiding an increase in intrinsic load.

4. Discussion
This study was designed to examine the proposition that using emotional design elements in a multimedia lesson protects learners from psychological states that might negatively impact learning. To this end, a sequential-task paradigm (e.g., Baumeister, 1998) was adopted to investigate the effect of the emotional design principle under the ego depletion state. The results support the general conclusion that using positive emotional design elements in a multimedia lesson can reduce the impairment of learning caused by the ego depletion effect by avoiding cognitive overload.

4.1. Does emotional design attenuate the impairment of the ego depletion effect on learning performance？
The results of this study indicated a negative effect of ego depletion on learning performance. Compared with participants in the non-depletion condition, participants in the depletion condition underperformed on the transfer test but not on the retention test. This result is consistent with previous findings that the ego depletion effect primarily hampers tasks requiring complex cognitive processes, whereas it does not impair less demanding tasks (Schmeichel et al., 2003). In our study, compared with the relatively simple task of recognizing presented information (i.e., retention), the more demanding task of problem-solving (i.e., transfer) required the learner to construct more abstract cognitive schemata and involved more complex cognitive operations (Merrie, van Merriënboer, Schuurman, de Croock, & Paas, 2002; Mayer, 2014b). Hence, performance on this task (transfer) was impaired because of the ego depletion effect, whereas the performance of simple recognition (i.e., retention) was not.

This study also found a small positive effect of learning with positive design materials on transfer performance. Participants who learned with positive emotional design materials performed better on the transfer test than those who learned with neutral design materials. Although learning with positive emotional design materials in the depletion condition showed a certain trend to alleviate the decrease in transfer performance in the depletion condition, the non-significant interaction between depletion and design indicates that using an emotional design approach is insufficient to offset the negative impact of the depletion effect on learning performance.

4.2. Does emotional design positively impact learners’ affective states?
Consistent with previous findings (e.g., Um et al., 2012; Plass & Kaplan, 2016), the results of this study showed that using an emotional design approach could both enhance positive emotions and reduce negative emotions during the learning process. However, inconsistent with our hypothesis, learning with positive emotional design materials in the depleted condition seem to neither amplify learners' positive emotions, as indicated by Vanco and Christensen (2016), nor inhibit more negative emotions as predicted by Plass and Kaplan (2016). One possible interpretation is that compared with the well-designed visual-reality entertainment instruction adopted by Vanco and Christensen (2016), merely redesigning learning materials with face-like shapes and warm colors may only have a small effect on learners' affective states. Thus, the small effect of the emotional design approach on leaners’ affective states may not fully satisfy their goal to “seek enjoyment” and, consequently, cannot amplify their emotional experience in the depletion condition.

Another possible reason is that the self-report questionnaire (i.e., PANAS) may not accurately reflect participants' affective states. Although PANAS (Watson et al., 1988) is the most commonly used measurement in emotional design research, it does not “measure all pleasant and unpleasant affective states, but rather … only high-activation states” (Russell & Barrett, 1999, pp. 12–13). Indeed, low-activation affective states (e.g., calm, relaxed, distressed, and jittery) are not included in the scope of PANAS (Ekkekakis & Zenko, 2016, p. 306). The psychophysiological data collected in this study suggest that using a positive emotional design approach may induce low-activation emotional states rather than high-activation emotional states. According to polyvagal theory (Porges, 2007), a higher RMSSD level reflects greater parasympathetic nervous system activity, which inhibits the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) through the cardiac vagal nerve, thereby avoiding fight/flight responses. As high-activation emotions are accompanied by clear SNS activity (Potter & Bolls, 2012), if a positive emotional design approach can induce high-activation emotions, a lower RMSSD level should be observed in the positive emotional design condition, indicating the disinhibition of the parasympathetic nervous system. However, we found that participants in the positive emotional design condition had a relatively high PNS activity (higher RMSSD), thereby suggesting that the emotional design approach may inhibit SNS activity. Further studies should adopt a direct measurement of learners’ SNS activity (e.g., skin conductance) to test this possibility.

4.3. Does emotional design help the learner maintain self-regulation strength?
This study found a mild effect of depletion on RMSSD levels during learning, thereby indicating that depletion participants had a lower RMSSD level than non-depletion participants. Considering that a higher RMSSD reflects greater self-regulation (e.g., Geisler et al., 2016; Segerstrom & Nes, 2007), the results can be explained as participants in the non-depletion condition having better self-regulation during the learning process than those in the depletion condition. This rationale corresponds with the assumption of the resource model of self-regulation (Baumeister, 2014; Baumeister et al., 1998) that ego depletion reduces the self-regulation strength in a subsequent task, and explains why participants underperformed in the depletion condition.

The study also found a small effect of design on RMSSD levels, thus indicating that participants who received positive emotional design materials had relatively higher RMSSD levels than those in the neutral emotional design condition. This finding is consistent with the assumption that learning with positive emotional design materials could promote self-regulation (Plass & Kaplan, 2016). The non-significant interaction between depletion and design indicates that learning with emotional design materials does not change the pattern of learners’ RMSSD levels regardless of whether they are depleted. It is possible that the psychophysiological measurement adopted in this study is not sensitive to a small effect caused by the emotional design approach (cf. Korbach, Brünken, Park, Korbach, & Bru, 2017; Paas & van Merriënboer, 1994).

4.4. Does emotional design help the learner manage cognitive load?
This study found a mild effect of depletion on perception of intrinsic load, which indicates that depletion participants rated higher intrinsic load than non-depletion participants. Such a result is consistent with the resource model that lack of mental resources increases perception of the task demand (Baumeister, 2014). The results also replicate findings that participants who learned with positive emotional design material rated lower task demand than those in the neutral emotional design condition (for a review and meta-analysis, see Brom et al., 2018; Wong et al., 2020). The analysis also revealed a marginally significant interaction between depletion and design. The ego depletion effect led to a significantly higher intrinsic load when learning with neutral emotional design materials, whereas this was not the case for depletion participants in the positive emotional design condition. These results indicate that using the positive emotional approach could avoid increasing the intrinsic load caused by resource depletion.

The benefits of such a pattern were supported by moderated mediation analysis. The results revealed that depletion participants reported greater intrinsic load, which was, in turn, negatively associated with the transfer test score. This indirect effect was only observed in the neutral emotional design condition, but disappeared in the positive emotional design condition. Regardless of whether they were depleted, participants who learned positive emotional design materials reported lower intrinsic loads. These findings confirmed that the positive emotional design approach protects learning from negative impacts by avoiding cognitive overload (Plass & Kaplan, 2016), and support the prediction of “cumulative effect” (Plass & Kalyuga, 2019). That is, the depletion of mental resources in a period of time may disrupt subsequent learning episodes.

The results of this study also revealed a small effect of emotional design on perceived extraneous load, which can be interpreted as an attention catching effect (Calvo & Lang, 2004; Park et al., 2015). This fact indicates that especially designed visual elements help learners concentrate on the key content of the material, thereby reducing unnecessary visual search processes. The results also revealed that perceived extraneous load is not impacted by the depletion effect. It indicates that the main function of the emotional design approach is to manage intrinsic load, especially in the depletion condition.

4.5. Theoretical and practical implications
Despite the relatively small effects found, this study has important theoretical and practical implications. From a theoretical perspective, the findings explain how emotional design works in multimedia learning, which is different from earlier assumptions (i.e., emotional design facilitates cognitive effort investment, Um et al., 2012). It also provides preliminary evidence for the assumption of the ICALM (Plass & Kaplan, 2016), thus suggesting that learners' affective states may decelerate the consumption of their mental resources, in turn avoiding cognitive overload in subsequent learning episodes. From a practical perspective, the results of this study suggest that educators should pay more attention to the negative impact of resource depletion on learning. For example, teachers should evaluate the likelihood of resource depletion from each activity and try to coordinate to maintain appropriate levels of learning throughout the class. Moreover, new technology, such as affective computers (Calvo & D'Mello, 2011; Picard, 2003) and pedagogical agents can be adopted to monitor students' states in real time and provide feedback as required.

5. Limitations and future research
Some limitations of the study remain to be addressed by future research. First, despite the measurement issue discussed earlier, the effect of the emotional design approach is small in this study. In spite of the small-to-medium effects of positive emotional design on intrinsic load and extraneous load (
 = 0.10 and 0.07), our sample size (N = 120) may have been insufficient to detect other effects with an alpha level of 0.05, a power level of 0.80 (Erdfelder, FAul, Buchner, & Lang, 2009). It is possible that the effect of emotional design is influenced by moderator factors excluded from our study. Two recent meta-analyses (Brom et al., 2018; Wong & Adesope, 2020) have shown that using positive emotional design materials only has small-to-medium effects on learning and that the effect is influenced by several moderators (e.g., age, instructional time, culture). For example, it is possible that the effect of positive emotional design can be more obvious in prolonged learning instructions (e.g., 45 min), or with a stronger manipulation of ego depletion.

Second, the present findings support the idea that learners’ affective states can protect learning from being negatively impacted by reducing intrinsic cognitive load. However, they could not fully explain the effect of emotion on cognitive load. For example, there is substantial empirical evidence to support the assumption that positive emotion facilitates cognitive effort, whereas these findings are at odds with the resource model (Baumeister et al., 1998), which does not allow for increased cognitive load. It is still unclear whether there is any mediating variable that can shift the effect of emotions in opposite ways (from reducing the consumption of mental resources to accelerating the investment of mental resources or vice versa). Future research should focus on this problem.

6. Conclusion
This study replicated and extended previous findings on the effect of using the emotional design principle (Um et al., 2012) in multimedia instruction. We found that using positive emotional design elements (i.e., face-like shapes and bright warm colors) alleviated the decrease in transfer performance in the ego depletion condition by avoiding cognitive overload.
