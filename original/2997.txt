PowerPoint is a basic tool for university teaching. Teachers use it extensively for presenting material. At times, it is used as a guide for organizing lessons, at other times it is used with the intention of summarizing essential curricular content. The way in which PowerPoint is used and the form it takes differs between faculties. The present article aims to evaluate the impact of the provision of slides on student academic performance and attendance (regardless of test scores). For this purpose, a quasi-experimental study was carried out with two intrasubject manipulated learning situations in which copies of slides created by teachers were, or were not, made available to students prior to class sessions. Additionally, student academic engagement and study strategies were assessed using two scales in order to analyse whether these variables modified the relationship between access to slides and academic performance. Outcomes revealed that access to slides developed by teachers had a negative impact on student performance and attendance to classes. Student academic engagement and study strategies were found to modify the relationship between academic performance and access to slides.

1. Introduction
The use of PowerPoint has increased since the emergence of information and communication technologies (ICT) within university classrooms (Bedenlier, Bond, Buntins, Zawacki-Richter, & ). A large proportion of university teachers use this digital tool in class as an adjunct to theoretical and practical content during practical teaching sessions (e.g., Hill, Arford, Lubitow, & Smollin, 2012; Moulton, Türkay, & Kosslyn, 2017).

Nonetheless, the way in which teachers use these tools and provide content (images, animations, text, etc.) within slides may differ greatly between teachers. As a result, the use of this tool may have a differential impact on teaching (Spiteri & Rundgren, 2020). Of the different styles used when preparing a PowerPoint presentation, some teachers fill the slides with text to provide a summary of taught content. In contrast, other teachers may use them to highlight simple words or statements which facilitate the structure of their verbal teaching (Uzun & Kilis, 2019) and others may incorporate static or animated images to help them develop or represent specific content to be taught in the class (Knight, Paroutis & Heracleaus, 2018). One characteristic that all of these styles share in common is that it is always the teacher who decides on the purpose of the slides, in addition to whether they will display visual and/or textual information (Akgün, Babur, & Albayrak, 2016).

As a result, the emergence of digital presentations in the classroom has also generated extensive debate regarding the potential cognitive benefits of student learning associated with the use of these digital presentations (Chou, Chang & Liu, 2015). As proposed by the cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML, Mayer, 2001), the combination visually and verbally represented information contributes to an improved learning experience and, therefore, better academic performance (Mayer & Moreno, 2003). Thus, the use of digital presentations in the classroom should always be associated with a better teaching experience. However, recent evidence reported in scientific literature does not corroborate the assumptions of CTML (see the review and meta-analysis published by Baker, Goodboy, Bowman, & Wright, 2018). Baker et al. (2018) recently conducted a meta-analysis with the aim of assessing evidence about the impact on students' cognitive learning of PowerPoint use in classes. Findings revealed that some studies showed effects in favour of PowerPoint use (29.17%), whilst other studies showed negative (22.92%) or no effects of PowerPoint use (47.92%). The effect size produced (k = 48) was not significant g = 0.067 [95%CI -0.103, 0.236], I2 = 91.39% and so the authors concluded that evidence generally failed to support the use of PowerPoint by teachers. Nonetheless, this approach fails to consider an important aspect of this educational issue. Specifically, how do students use the information presented within slides?

In parallel to the debate on whether or not the use of digital presentations in classrooms improves student achievement, another debate has begun regarding whether or not students should access the digital presentation media used by the teacher during classes and whether such access has an impact on student cognitive learning.

1.1. Literature review
Questions around whether teachers should give students access to classroom slides before class sessions and the subsequent impact of this on student learning and learning-related factors drive the main focus of the present research and provide the basis for the proposed study. Within the scientific literature, the student perspective on this debate is relatively clear. When students are asked about whether class slides should be made available, they consistently report that provision of slides would be helpful to the learning process (Babb & Ross, 2009; Hill et al., 2012; Zdaniuk, Gruman, & Cassidy, 2019). Similarly, when students are asked about their perceptions of using or not using digital presentations in class, the response has also been uniformly in favour of using digital presentations (Cosgun Ögeyik, 2017; Dandekar & Deepak, 2017; Hill et al., 2012). Nonetheless, these positive student perceptions do not clearly reflect any positive effect on cognitive learning (Baker et al., 2018).

Despite it being common to hear our academic colleagues discuss whether they will share slides with students and whether this is better or worse for student learning and attention, few studies have analysed the debate from an experimental perspective. Furthermore, outcomes of the studies that have been conducted fail to demonstrate a consistent effect on student cognitive learning of providing classroom resources. With regards to these studies, some have shown that making the slides used in class available to students has a positive effect on their subsequent cognitive learning (Austin, Lee, & Carr, 2004; Chen & Lin, 2008; Grabe, Christopherson, & Douglas, 2005). Other studies have shown negative effects, namely, students with access to classroom slides performed worse than students without access to slides (Debevec, Shih, & Kashyap, 2006; Kim, 2018; Weatherly, Grabe, & Arthur, 2003). Finally, a third group of studies found no effects on academic performance (Babb & Ross, 2009; Cravero, 2017; Worthington & Levasseur, 2015; Zdaniuk et al., 2019).

All studies to have evaluated the impact on student learning of providing students with the slides used in class by teachers, have been conducted using inter-group comparisons, in which naturally occurring classroom groups are typically assigned to different experimental conditions (with or without slides). This type of design in natural contexts makes it difficult to control extraneous variables which may affect outcomes (e.g. individual differences). For this reason, the present study seeks to analyse the impact of facilitating classroom slides, using an intrasubject design for the first time.

Worthington and Levasseur (2015, p. 16) proposed that “positive effects of IP slides can be transmitted mainly to a more organized and motivated learner”. In order to assess the potential differential effects of slides use in students, these authors analysed slide impact according to academic performance (e.g., Chen & Lin, 2008). Worthington and Levasseur (2015) observed that the availability of the slides did not produces differences in student learning when grouping students according to final exam performance (high, medium and low). It is possible that grouping students, post-hoc, according to academic performance measured in terms of test scores may affect final outcomes, in addition to the manipulation itself (with or without slides).

The perspective presented by Worthington and Levasseur (2015, p. 16) suggests learning outcomes, resulting from the provision of slides to students in class, could be modified by other variables linked with academic performance, such as student academic motivation and skillset when it comes to studying subject material. In this regard, research has shown engagement to be a positive predictor of academic achievement, both directly (León, Augusto-Landa, & García-Martínez, 2021; Wang & Eccles, 2013; Wu, 2019) and as a mediator of other related variables (Dotterer & Lowe, 2011; Reyes, Brackett, Rivers, White, & Salovey, 2012; Serrano & Andreu, 2016). Similarly, it has been observed that students who use study strategies more frequently and effectively demonstrate better academic performance (Ghiasvand, 2010; León et al., 2021; Vrugt & Oort, 2008). Evidence of the joint relationship of these two factors on academic performance can be found in a study published by León et al. (2021). This work shows how both factors (engagement and study strategies) are highly inter-related and play a positive predictive role in relation to student academic performance. In consideration of these approaches and the standpoint proposed by Worthington and Levasseur (2015), the present article analyses the way in which student academic engagement and study strategies may modify the learning impact of slide provision. These two factors will be measured using surveys administered prior to a regular timetabled exam. In line with existing literature (e.g., Moreira, Dias, Vaz, & Vaz, 2013), it is proposed that engagement and study strategies may be associated with better organisation and motivation towards learning. Thus, students who score highly in relation to these factors should benefit from the provision of slides (Chen & Lin, 2008) or, in the worst of cases, not be disadvantaged by it (Worthington & Levasseur, 2015).

In accordance previous studies (Babb & Ross, 2009; Worthington & Levasseur, 2015), the present study sought to examine whether class attendance is affected by the availability of slides. In previous studies in which impact on class attendance was evaluated, attendance had a direct impact (% overall attendance and participation grade) on student final grades.

In order to analyse the real impact of access to slides on attendance, the present study will analyse impact on unprompted attendance, in order to ensure that there will be no additional incentive for students to attend other than academic motivation. In addition, student attendance will be evaluated randomly, without prior notice, so that student behaviour is not modified by simple knowledge of the evaluation.

1.2. Research question and objectives
Given the fact that existing literature presents equivocal findings regarding whether providing students with slides is beneficial in terms of student performance, the main objective of the present work is to provide new evidence on the impact on academic performance and unprompted attendance of providing students with access to classroom slides. In addition, we set out to analyse whether two factors associated with academic performance − academic engagement and study strategies − could predict the effect of classroom slide provision on student performance. From this, several research questions arise which need to be answered.

-
What is the effect on student academic performance of providing students with slides prior to the commencement of lessons?

-
What is the effect of providing slides prior to class sessions on unprompted attendance of students to classes?

-
Does the effect of slide provision on academic performance differ according to students' level of academic engagement and/or use of study strategies?

In consideration of the questions listed above and in response to the main objective of the present study, a study was conducted to examine the effects in student of the provision of classroom slides prior lessons, using a within-subject design for the first time. This approach will enable us to measure the impact on student learning of both levels of manipulation (slide provision versus no slide provision) (e.g. Charness, Gneezy, & Kuhn, 2012).

In addition, analysis will control for other variables which have not been controlled in previous studies and could impact outcomes. The extraneous variables considered included ensuring that exam questions could not be answered directly using slide content, randomization to attenuate extraneous variables (e.g. number of slides pertaining to each of the two conditions, see the section on instruments and procedure for more details). Further, we sought to evaluate the impact of slide provision on unprompted attendance (attendance that was not included within attendance evaluations). Unlike previous studies, the present study considered a measure of attendance which was in no way related to final grades (academic performance). This will allow us, in the case of finding an effect of the present intervention on attendance, to attribute such effects to the intervention employed. Finally, in order to further understanding about whether slide provision affects all students equally, the potential role of student academic engagement and study strategies in modifying student learning outcomes was analysed.

2. Material and methods
2.1. Participants
The study was carried out with 173 students undertaking the second year of an Early Childhood Education Degree at the University of Jaén (Spain). Participating students had an average age of 22.3 years (SD 3.75) and 89.7% were female. These percentages are consistent with the distribution of men and women found in the overall population of pre-school teachers in Spain (Spanish National Institute of Statistics, 2015). All students participated voluntarily in the study. Participant informed consent was secured in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

2.2. Instruments
Slides were created using the PowerPoint program included in the Office 2016 package. A total number of 167 slides were developed for the full intervention period, which were then divided between 6 topics. The number of slides per topic was as follows: Topic 1: 32, Topic 2: 41, Topic 3: 27, Topic 4: 22, Topic 5: 24, Topic 6: 21. Slides were designed by a teacher (the first author) in order to ensure that the most important information for each topic was included and that information would be presented in a way that supported teachers when carrying out class sessions. Slides included both static images and text. The official university platform was used to share the slides with students as they progressed onto each topic. Access to this platform was restricted to students enrolled on the relevant modules.

The Google Forms tool was used to create the questionnaire. This questionnaire consisted of three blocks. In the first block, students were asked to provide general information (sex, age, etc …) and the last 5 numbers of their national identity number. This information was required to enable questionnaire outcomes to be linked with exam results. Students were ensured that all identity numbers would be removed from the data matrix following the retrieval of exam scores. The second and third blocks included scales to measure engagement and study strategies. The order of the presentation of items was entirely random.

In order to measure the academic engagement of students, a version of the UWE-S 9 questionnaire translated into Spanish was used (Schaufeli, Bakker, & Salanova, 2006). This scale had previously been used to measure academic engagement (Coelho-Martinho & Conde-Pérez, 2013). The scale comprises 9 items which evaluate 3 dimensions of engagement: vigour (eng1 to eng3), dedication (eng4 to eng6) and acquisition (eng7 to eng9). Responses to each item were evaluated along a 7-point Likert scale with 1 indicating “never” and 7 indicating “always”.

In order to measure the academic strategies used by university students, we used an adapted version of the study techniques questionnaire scale (Herrera-Torres & Lorenzo-Quiles, 2009). This scale is made up of 12 items that evaluate 3 dimensions: strategies for study management (str1 and str2), strategies employed prior to studying (str3 to str7) and strategies employed during studying (str8 to str12). A 7-point Likert scale is used to indicate the frequency with which the strategy presented by each item is employed (1 = “never” and 7 = “always”).

Questions pertaining to the subject were posed in the form of a multiple choice test with 3 response options. Two test types were created in correspondence with the type of intervention received. In this way, subject exams included 12 items pertaining to topics on which slides had been provided to students and 12 items pertaining to topics on which slides had not been provided. A bank of 20 questions was created for each item, with the items posed to students being randomly selected from this question bank. Questions were developed in such a way that ensured that the correct response information could not be literally extracted from any of the slides. This sought to ensure that students would need to have understood subject content in order to respond correctly.

Written information was provided to students at the beginning of the exam to ensure correct completion. This information explained that only one of the three options provided was correct. It was also explained to students that the following formula would be applied when calculating final test scores: final score = hits - (errors/(k −1)), where k is the number of response options. This was done in order to correct for the probability of randomly providing correct responses. In line with the aforementioned formula, correct responses sum 0.42 to the final score, whist incorrect responses subtract 0.21 from the final score. Blank responses do not add to or subtract from the final score.

2.3. Procedure
Subject slides were created prior to the beginning of the course. In order to ensure a uniform distribution of slides between the two experimental conditions (Y-ppt = modules on which the teacher provided slides prior to theoretical sessions, vs. N-ppt = modules on which slides were not provided), a script was created in Excel which randomly assigned the modules to two groups (no identity) and calculated the number of slides to be assigned to each group. The script was re-ran until an outcomes was reached in which the assignment attributed to each group did not differ by more than 10 slides. This criterion was met following the third run of the script. Group 1 was assigned topics 1, 3 and 5, corresponding to a total of 84 slides. Group 2 was assigned topics 2, 4 and 6, corresponding to a total of 83 slides. Group identity was also randomly assigned, with group 1 being assigned the modules on which slides were provided and group 2 being assigned the modules on which slides were not provided.

In the first session of the course, students were informed that slides for some modules would be uploaded to the university digital platform prior to commencing that module (Y-ppt condition), whilst no slides would be given for other modules (N-ppt condition). Prior to starting a new module, students were informed about whether or not slides would be provided. Students were informed that attendance to theoretical sessions was not compulsory and would have no effect on their final class score. However, it was noted that class participation would be rewarded. Students were also informed that class attendance would be monitored randomly throughout the course without prior notice. Attendance was checked once in each module. The session in which attendance was checked was chosen randomly. This was done to prevent students from predicting the day on which attendance would be monitored.

Approximately mid-way through the semester, students were asked at the beginning of a class session to complete an online questionnaire using a mobile device with Internet access (mobile phone, tablet or laptop). The general purpose of the study was explained and students were given access to via a link which had been previously posted on the e-learning platform. The link gave access to the Google Forms questionnaire. The first page presented requested informed consent, providing full instructions and outlining the objectives of the questionnaire. Once consent was provided, students were automatically directed to the start of the questionnaire. Students were informed that the questionnaire would be available for completion for one week. The completion rate was 80.35% (136 students).

The aforementioned test models were applied on the day students sat their module exams. The two test models were randomly distributed between the students. Instructions to complete the test were provided and the purpose of the test was explained. Following test completion, Y-ppt and N-ppt indices were calculated for each test from students’ correct responses, incorrect responses and blank responses. This produced Y-ppt and N-ppt scores for each module.

2.4. Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed using jamovi software (The jamovi Project, 2019). The α value for all statistical tests was set to 0.05. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to verify internal consistency and validity of the scale. Scale reliability was estimated according to Cronbach's α and McDonald's ω. Slide provision made up the independent variable (slides provided versus slides not provided). From here on, modules for which slides were provided will be referred to simply as Y-ppt, whilst those for which slides were not provided will be referred to as N-ppt. The scores recorded for exam questions pertaining to each topic within each condition make up the dependent variables used to evaluate academic achievement. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for this analysis. Regression analysis was performed to analyse whether academic engagement and study strategies predicted outcomes in the Y-ppt and N-ppt conditions. Student scores for each scale factor (constructive engagement: Vigour, engagement and acquisition; constructive strategies: Organisation, strategies employed prior to studying and strategies employed during studying) were obtained by scaling item scores according to the standardised factor loading produced in CFA. With regards to analysis of the moderation effects of factors analysed in the questionnaire (engagement and strategies) on exam scores, a moderation analysis was proposed. This analysis calculated SE from a bootstrap analysis of 1000 samples.

3. Results
In order to analyse the structure of the questionnaire and its validity, CFA was conducted of questionnaire outcomes for academic engagement and strategies. Outcomes from the analysis led to the elimination of 3 items (str4, str7 and str10) from the study strategies subscale, specifically, due to these items not presenting standardised factor loadings greater than 0.3. Outcomes for the engagement scale showed an excellent fit (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2010) (χ2(24) = 32.28, p = .120), with CFI = 0.973, TLI = 0.959, SRMR = 0.050, RMSEA = 0.050 (RMSEA 90% CI [0.000, 0.081]), AIC = 3259.14 and BIC = 3346.52. The study strategies scale also showed excellent fit (χ2(24) = 31.73, p = .134), with CFI = 0.950, TLI = 0.925, SRMR = 0.051, RMSEA = 0.049 (RMSEA 90% CI [0.000, 0.090]), AIC = 4446.31 and BIC = 4533.69. Table 1 presents the factor loadings of each indicator on the relevant factor. Both scales showed good reliability, with α = 0.801 and ω = 0.822 (engagement), and α = 0.725 and ω = 0.728 (strategies).

Examination of response types showed that, in the Y-ppt condition, 46.89% of responses were correct, 24.95% were incorrect and 28.16% were left unanswered, whilst in the N-ppt condition, 53.52% of responses were correct, 24.38% were incorrect and 22.10% were left blank. Response patterns were shown to be significantly different between the two conditions (χ2(2) = 22.68, p < .001, Cramer's V = 0.076). Although the number of incorrect answers was similar for both conditions (1.2% difference), more correct answers were provided in N-ppt (6.6%) and highly notable differences in relation to blank answers were found (12% difference). A 2 (PPT availability: Y-ppt vs. N-ppt) x 3 (response type: correct vs. incorrect vs. blank) ANOVA was performed. Results of this showed a main effect of response type (F(2, 320) = 167. 84, p < .001, η2p = .512, CI95% [0.438–0.570]) and the presence of a two-way interaction (PPT x response type, F(2, 320) = 11.51, p < .001, η2p = .067, CI95% [0.021–0.122]). Fig. 1 presents the results of this analysis. As can be seen, the interaction uncovered was due to the higher number of correct answers and lower number of blank answers given in the N-ppt condition.

Mean scores were 3.44 (SD 2.06) and 4.13 (SD 2.21) in the Y-ppt condition and N-ppt condition, respectively. Fig. 2 presents student scores in the Y-ppt (grey) and N-ppt (white) conditions using a raincloud plot (Allen, Poggiali, Whitaker, Marshall, & Kievit, 2019). For each condition, raw data are presented at the bottom of the plot and probability density is shown at the top. A box plot is given in the middle. Repeated measures ANOVA was performed to compare scores achieved by individuals to whom slides had been provided (Y-ppt) with scores obtained by individuals not receiving slides (N-ppt). Outcomes revealed that scores within the N-ppt group were significantly higher than those in the Y-ppt group (F(1, 161) = 10.0, p = .002, η2p = .059, CI95% [0.008–0.139]).

Dispersion probability for each condition is represented as a cloud at the top of the plot. A boxplot is presented the centre of the plot and individual observations as shown as circles at the bottom.

For the evaluation of student attendance, attendance was monitored in each of the two conditions. The first recording of attendance was found to be 79.89% in the N-ppt condition and 16.45% in the Y-ppt condition. The second recording was 77.23% in the N-ppt group and 26.27 in the Y-ppt group. Finally, the third recording was 79.59% in the N-ppt condition and 18.04% in the Y-ppt condition. This pattern of attendance was found to differ significantly between conditions (χ2(1) = 73.75, p < .001, Cramer's V = 0.617). Specifically, students were less likely to attend class when slides were made available on the virtual teaching platform than when slides were not provided.

Linear regression was used to analyse the potential direct impact of engagement and study strategies on the exam scores obtained in Y-ppt and N-ppt conditions. As shown in Table 2, organisation was the only factor able to predict Y-ppt scores (β = 0.179). Linear regression outcomes suggested no differential effects between the Y-ppt and N-ppt conditions (β = 0.153, p = .051).

An analysis was conducted to assess the moderating role of engagement and study strategies on the differential effects of Y-ppt and N-ppt conditions on exam scores. These analyses showed that engagement may moderate the effect of slide provision (Z = 2.14, p = .032, CI95% [0.042–0.792]). In contrast, strategies did not seem to be a good moderator of these effect (Z = 1.23, p = .216, CI95% [0.042–0.792]). Fig. 3 shows the effect of the predictor (Y-ppt) on the dependent variable (N-ppt) at different levels of moderation (engagement on the left and strategies on the right). In the case of engagement (left graph), significant moderation was found in students with high scores (one standard deviation above the mean), although moderation was not significant for students with low scores (one standard deviation below the mean). In other words, students with average or above average levels of engagement had higher exam scores, regardless of whether or not they were provided with slides. In the case of strategies (graph on the right), moderation according to slide provision was only significant in students with high study strategy use.

4. Discussion
The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of slide provision prior to class sessions on student performance. Additionally, the sought to evaluate the impact of slide provision on unprompted (inconsequential to final grades) attendance.

To this end, a novel intrasubject design was used, for the first time in the field, to analyse within-subject effects of two levels of the manipulated variables, in this way removing confounding effects due to individual differences. In addition, in contrast to the strategy employed by existing studies, the effect of outcomes of potential extraneous variables was controlled through randomization. For instance, the number of slides provided and the selection of modules for each condition were decided randomly. It was also ensured that correct responses to the exam questions could not be directly extracted from the slides.

Given the results obtained, student exam scores were higher in relation to questions pertaining to topics which were not covered by the slides as opposed to those covered by the slides (Worthington & Levasseur, 2015). In relation to this, making slides available prior to oral presentations reduces the need for learners to take notes and reduced the attention paid to teacher explanations (Daniels, 1999). In this vein, it has also been noted that the availability of slides may cause students to perceive the content of the slide as more important than the explanation given by teachers, reducing their focus (Mayer & Johnson, 2008) . In this regard, slides in the present study were created by the teacher as a digital aid to guide classes. They could not be considered as a single study document as they were insufficient in themselves to correctly answer exam questions. In this regard, authors such as Weckler (2012) have highlighted that students who tend to pay more attention to the content of slides than to oral explanations tend to suffer more dysfunctional attention, decreasing their ability to retain oral information. Slide content is, therefore, a relevant issue. The presentation of slides with an overload of information and visual content, alongside the teacher's oral explanation may cause cognitive overload in students as cognitive demands exceed students' processing capacities. Thus, the slides provided in the present study were concise and contained only an outline of what the teacher planned to say in class. According to Weckler (2012), the type of slides used in the present study should have encouraged students to pay attention to the teacher while speaking, however, no benefit was found in comparison with the condition in which students did not have prior access to slides.

This finding should be considered in light of the first research question posed regarding whether student performance is affected by slide provision. In view of obtained outcomes, it can be confirmed that slide provision had a negative effect on student performance. However, this does not reveal the motive behind this effect. In order to uncover this motive, specific aspects should be considered which may have an influence. One of these aspects relates to the author of the slides with the ideal author being the module lecturer as they fully understand the purpose of the slides and can, therefore, develop them according to the outcome they hope to achieve. Usually, slides are created by the lecturer as an aid to their classes and not as didactic material to substitute study or class notes. In this particular case, use of the slides as a singular teaching material would have led to a large amount of subject content being missed. With regards to this, academic performance translated into better exam scores has been indicated when students make their own notes (Chen, 2013) and develop a study plan in anticipation of future study (Geller, Toftness, Armstrong, Carpenter, Manz, Coffman et al., 2018). Encouraging individual responsibility when elaborating study material may lead to an important turning point when it comes to attenuating differences in performance outcomes between students.

However, despite the importance given to the elaboration of notes and outlines for reinforcing knowledge of study topics, some studies have outlined difficulties faced by students when taking notes and the positive impact of specifically developing this skill (Nakayama, Mutsuura, & Yamamoto, 2017). An example of this comes from research conducted by Willians, McCarley, Sharpe and Johnson (2017). This focused on students' ability to identify and code information and discriminate that which is relevant from that which is not when using PowerPoint. Findings showed that feedback was especially useful to students with low levels of abstraction and discernment, although these outcomes were not translated into good exam outcomes. This suggests that initial ability plays a key role (Schrader & Grassinger, 2021). Literature on learning argues that when students create their own notes their recall mechanism is improves by mobilizing all of the cognitive processes involved in learning and memory (Konrad, Joseph, & Itoi, 2011).

In order to address the gap between the importance of note-taking and the occasional inefficiency of students to successfully perform this activity, the provision of schematised material could provide a solution as such material synthesises key ideas and helps students develop their own key notes (Chen, Teo, & Zhou, 2017). In fact, evidence exists that, when students are provided with a structure from which they can prepare their notes, guided note-taking is related to higher exam scores (Chen, 2019). In consideration of that discussed above, the dilemma of whether or not to provide slides may require a change of focus., foregrounding the content of slides provided by faculty members and focusing on the material itself (Dukhan, Brenner, & Cameron, 2019).

Further, an article published by Baker et al. (2018) examined evidence of the impact on academic performance of using PowerPoint presentations in the classroom. Improvements were identified following the use of PowerPoint slides when compared with traditional teaching in K-12 students, although no differences were found in college students. Similarly, neither teaching type was found to explain the heterogenous outcome. This may have been due to the study's failure to consider the content and characteristics of teaching material (Wecker, 2012). From this study, it was concluded that the usefulness of PowerPoint slides is determined by the way in which slides are used and not simply by whether they are used or not in class.

Another of the variables considered in the present study was student engagement and strategies employed to prepare to study. Based on the relationship shown between these factors and academic performance, it was expected that students with high levels of these factors would be affected differently by the provision of classroom slides than those with low levels of these factors. Contrary to this hypothesis, neither engagement nor strategies predicted outcomes in Y-ppt or N-ppt. However, they were shown to modify the relationship between these variables. In other words, these factors (engagement and strategies) led to better exam scores, regardless of condition. That is, high factor profiles produce a positive relationship between Y-pp and N-pp (higher Y-pp and higher N-pp and vice versa). The relationship between these factors and academic performance has been discussed in other studies such as those conducted by Fishman (2014) and Hassanbeigi et al. (2011). In the present study, slide provision had a negative impact on students with both high engagement and high learning strategy use, in addition to students who reported low levels of these factors. This demonstrates that the negative performance effect of slide provision in students may outweigh the positive effects induced by engagement and strategy use. A similar interpretation can be made from findings reported by Worthington and Levasseur (2015). In their study, negative effects of slide provision was found regardless of students' prior academic performance.

With regards to the use of PowerPoint, specifically, several studies have highlighted positive student attitudes towards PowerPoint use. Such attitudes are born out of its ability to provide an outline that “structures” subject content and awaken motivations through its visual functionality (e.g. Baker et al., 2018). However, it is important to note that issues such as slide availability were not considered. With respect to the relationship between slide provision and student attendance, previously conducted research has proved to be equivocal with some studies showing no effect (Worthington & Levasseur, 2015) and others showing significant reductions in attendance following slide provision (Weatherly et al., 2003).

Evidence shows that attendance has a strong relationship with class grades. In this regard, students with higher class attendance tend to attain better grades (Sekiwu, Ssempala, & Frances, 2020). In the present study, slide provision negatively affected attendance. However, unlike in other studies, class attendance was unprompted given that it was not being considered as part of the final class grade. In addition, attendance assessments in each of the conditions (slide provision vs. no slide provision) were carried out randomly. This served to prevent students from predicting when the assessment would be performed and, in this way, ensure that attendance was not motivated by grades. Other studies have clearly shown that the provision of class slides decreases class attendance (Banerjee, 2021; Weatherly et al., 2003). Further, studies linking attendance and academic performance have shown that class attendance has a strong relationship with subject grades. Compulsory attendance policies also appear to have a small positive impact on average grades (Credé, Roch, & Kieszczynka).

Unlike other studies, the present study sought to place the focus on students themselves. Findings indicate that students achieved higher scores in relation to content for which they did not have access to class slides, meaning that they had to develop their own outlines.

4.1. Limitations and future perspectives
Similar to findings reported by Worthington and Levasseur (2015), present results suggest that providing slides to students prior to class session negatively affects their academic performance. However, the present study does not elucidate the underlying cause of this effect on performance.

The poorer performance found in the condition in which slides were made available was manifested as a lower number of correct answers and higher number of blank responses in comparison to the condition in which slides were not provided. Unfortunately, the present study cannot explain the reasons behind this effect of why students left more questions blank when they had access to slides.

It is true that the provision of slides caused students to stop attending classes. Class attendance has been found to be strongly associated with academic performance (Credé et al., 2010). It is therefore possible that the effect found in the present study may have been due to lower attendance. However, a study conducted by Worthington and Levasseur (2015) also found performance to be impinged following slide provision although, in this case, attendance was not affected. This outcome makes it more difficult to explain present findings with any certainty. Repeating the present study but also ensuring full attendance in both conditions may help to understand the influence of attendance on performance. In addition, outcomes obtained in relation to the factors evaluated as possible predictors of the relationship between slide availability and academic performance were not entirely conclusive. Although engagement and study strategies seemed to modify academic performance, effects did not differ between experimental conditions. In a similar way to that found by Worthington and Levasseur (2015) in relation to groupings based on final exam performance, factors strongly linked to performance improvement, such as engagement and study strategies, were negatively affected by slide provision. In this way, present results may indicate that the negative effect of slide provision outweighs the positive effect of the proposed factors, however, no affirmative conclusions can be made at this time.

In view of the above, an in-depth study is needed to identify the variables or factors that underlie the decrease seen in academic performance in relation to the provision of classroom slides. As discussed above, students strongly agree that teachers should make slides available, with the failure to do so generating significant dissatisfaction amongst students. Emotions have been shown to play an important role on academic performance (Schrader & Grassinger, 2021) and these negative feelings may partly explain the obtained effect. Future research should strive to examine factors which may reverse the effects found so that slide provision not only does not affect students negatively but, even, contributes to better academic performance.

5. Conclusion
Present findings provide evidence to fuel the debate on whether slide provision by teachers affects student performance in class. One of the main contributions of the present research is its use, for the first time, of a within-subject design to analyse the learning effect of slide provision in students. This design permitted control to be exerted over variables which were not controlled by previous studies and may influence performance outcomes. In addition, factors previously considered to affect student performance, such as engagement and study strategies, were not found to modify the learning effects of slide provision. According to previous studies (Baker et al., 2018), the conditions and characteristics of material is more important than slide provision when it comes to improving academic performance. Finally, it is important to uncover the characteristics that make PowerPoint a useful tool for both students and teachers.

In order to address the issues raised, we agree with the suggestions made by Baker et al. (2018) to develop studies which focus on the way in which PowerPoint is embedded in the classroom. To do this, it will be necessary to conduct a more comprehensive analysis of the factors pertaining to slide provision which could have a positive effect on both teachers' and students’ academic performance.Declarations.
