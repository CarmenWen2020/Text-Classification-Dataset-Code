This predictive correlational study examines to what extent the constructs of the Theory of Planned Behavior and program factors (i.e., classification and program of study) can predict preservice teachers' intention to use technology-enabled learning (TEL), a student-centered approach to technology integration as a cognitive tool. A survey was distributed to preservice teachers enrolled in a college of education at a midsize, public teaching university. The findings of this study cohere with and extend previous research regarding preservice teachers' intention to use technology, which suggested positive attitudes toward technology and a strong sense of personal control over the decision to use technology contribute to intention to use technology. The results demonstrated that program and theoretical variables predicted preservice teachers' intention to use TEL.

1. Introduction
Technology-enabled learning (TEL) is a student-centered approach to technology integration as a cognitive tool to communicate, collaborate, develop critical thinking skills, and solve authentic problems (Ertmer & Ottenbreit-Leftwich, 2012; Jonassen, 1994, 2005; Nelson & Hawk, 2020), which aligns with the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) Standards for Educators. ISTE standards state that teachers should use technology to facilitate students' active learning experiences, authentic learning, and critical thinking (ISTE, 2017). Unfortunately, teachers at all levels of education remain slow in adopting and using technology in authentic and active ways to promote students' critical thinking (Lee, 2018; Nelson & Hawk, 2020; Tondeur, van Braak, Ertmer, & Ottenbreit-Leftwich, 2016). Scherer and Teo (2019) noted, in their meta-analysis, that most educational technology integration continues to be focused on "word processing, presentation, and information tools" (p. 91) rather than on the facilitation of authentic and active learning. For example, teachers' technology use is often limited to presenting information to students via slide presentations as passive consumers. Teacher-centered technology uses remain dominant among practicing PreK-12 teachers and university faculty (Barak, 2017; Smagorinsky & Barnes, 2014; Tondeur et al., 2016).

Therefore, twenty years after Ertmer's (1999) seminal article explaining barriers to technology use in the classroom, researchers continue to examine the factors that influence teachers' intention to use and actual use of technology in the classroom as a way to understand and better facilitate more effective TEL (Farjon, Smits, & Voogt, 2019; Hur, Shen, Kale, & Cullen, 2015; Joo, Park, & Lim, 2018; Nelson & Hawk, 2020). The literature has established that intention is informed by a complex set of factors, and several theories have sought to explain the factors that contribute to intention. A few, like the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), have been applied broadly in the literature regarding teachers' intention to use technology in conjunction with teacher-centered approaches (e.g., technology integration as compared to TEL) in the last two decades (Scherer and Teo, 2019; Steinmetz, Knappstein, Ajzen, Schmidt, & Kabst, 2016; Teo, Zhou, & Noyes, 2016).

Both theory and research have demonstrated that complex internal and environmental factors contribute to teachers' use and intention to use technology in either teacher-centered or student-centered ways. Researchers agree that more study is needed, especially regarding TEL, if it is going to be more readily adopted (Ertmer & Ottenbreit-Leftwich, 2012; Farjon et al., 2019; Jung & Ottenbreit-Leftwich, 2020; Kramarski & Michalsky, 2015; Parkman, Litz, & Gromik, 2018; Schmid, Brianza, & Petko, 2021; Tondeur et al., 2016). Understanding factors associated with TEL and intention to use TEL can help PreK-12 administrators and college of education faculty develop targeted curriculum and interventions to promote TEL. Colleges of education, in particular, are uniquely positioned to assist preservice teachers in developing their intention to use, and ultimately the use of TEL, since they are emerging educators, developing their own pedagogical and technological philosophies during their teacher preparation programs. Therefore, in the present study, TPB serves as a framework for examining the factors that predict preservice teachers' intention to use TEL.

1.1. Literature review
1.1.1. The Theory of Planned Behavior
Originally developed in 1985, The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) is based on the premise that three constructs contribute to the development of an intention to perform a specific behavior such as TEL (Ajzen, 1991). These three main constructs are attitude (i.e., what a person believes about a behavior); subjective norm (i.e., what a person believes others think about a behavior); and perceived behavioral control (i.e., how much control a person feels they have over their choice to engage in the behavior) (Ajzen, 1985; Gretter & Yadav, 2018; Li, Li, & Franklin, 2016). Each of these constructs is informed by a person's beliefs. Behavioral beliefs (e.g., ideas about how teaching and learning look) inform attitudes, normative beliefs (e.g., ideas about how others think teaching and learning should look) inform subjective norms, and control beliefs (e.g., beliefs about how much control one has over how teaching and learning look) inform perceived behavior control (Armitage & Conner, 2001). These beliefs are formed "as a result of direct observation, inference based on prior knowledge, or outside information" (Nelson & Hawk, 2020, p. 2).

In this study, preservice teachers' attitudes refer to their judgments about the use of TEL based on their own beliefs and experiences. Subjective norms address the influence of the community on preservice teachers' intention. For example, Tondeur et al. (2016) noted the power of school context in influencing intention; thus, subjective norms include preservice teachers' present community (e.g., college of education professors, fellow education majors, and professional organizations) and future school community (e.g., future colleagues and administrators, parents of future students, and future students). Additionally, perceived behavioral control can explain both internal and environmental factors. Perceived behavioral control explains both a preservice teachers' internal feelings of control, defined as self-efficacy (Bandura, 1977) or confidence in the ability to exert control over their use of TEL, and environmental feelings of control, or perceived controllability (Ajzen, 2002). In the case of TEL, perceived controllability includes factors such as perceived knowledge, skills, and abilities, reliable access to devices and wireless internet, time for planning and TEL instruction, support from colleagues, and autonomy in curricular decision-making.

Additionally, Sadaf, Newby, and Ertmer (2012) noted that more studies are needed to "examine how experience contributes to the variance in [preservice teachers'] attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control" (p. 189). This need to examine how preservice teachers’ intentions change with time and experience was later echoed by Sanchez-Prieto, Hernandez-Garcia, Garcia-Penalvo, Chaparro-Pelaez, and Olmos-Miguelanez (2019). For this reason, this study also explored the addition of program factors. Previous studies have used the TPB to measure preservice teachers' intention to use technology at a single point in time or before and after an intervention (Batane & Ngwako, 2017; Hur et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016; Sadaf et al., 2012). However, preservice teachers gain knowledge and experience as they progress through their study program from pre-admission to completion. This has the potential to impact their intention to use TEL. Thus, this study examines the predictive validity of program factors, such as classification and program of study, as well as the constructs of TPB (attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavior control) on preservice teachers' intention to use TEL (see Fig. 1).

1.1.2. Technology-enabled learning
Research suggests that student-centered learning approaches can facilitate deeper learning and stronger critical thinking and collaboration skills (Barak, 2017; Chai, Tan, Deng, & Koh, 2017). In classrooms, student-centered approaches can be further supported by technologies that make it increasingly easy for teachers and students to collaborate and co-construct knowledge across time and space. Researchers have recognized the important interplay between technological and instructional choices, including their impact on student learning (Nelson & Hawk, 2020; Tsai & Tsai, 2019). Therefore, researchers have begun to shift focus from specific technology tools to how they are used to facilitate learning. The idea of technology as a cognitive tool to support students' knowledge construction and enable authentic tasks is not new.

Researchers have been advocating for student-centered approaches to technology integration since the 1990s when constructivist approaches to teaching and learning began to gain prominence in the literature (Bower, Highfield, Furney, & Mowbray, 2013; Ertmer & Ottenbreit-Leftwich, 2012; Jonassen, 1994, 2005). However, twenty years into the 21st century, the use of technology in many classrooms still aligns with a systematic, teacher-centered approach in which students learn from technology, rather than with technology as a cognitive tool (Ertmer & Ottenbreit-Leftwich, 2012; Lei, 2009). The lagging adoption of TEL can be attributed to the fact that student-centered approaches, such as TEL, disrupt more traditional teacher-centered pedagogies, which continue to prevail in many PreK-12 and college classrooms (Barak, 2017; Smagorinsky & Barnes, 2014; Tondeur et al., 2016). Teachers continue to serve as the "sage on the stage," conveying knowledge to students, rather than serving as the "guide on the side," facilitating students in the work of meaning-making by actively using technology tools to socially construct meaning (Ertmer & Ottenbreit-Leftwich, 2012; Hsu, 2016).

1.1.3. Preservice teachers' exposure to technology-enabled learning
If preservice teachers are going to begin adopting the role of “guide on the side,” then teacher education programs must move away from traditional uses of technology and pedagogy and instead model TEL so that preservice teachers can experience its value and utility. Kramarski and Michalsky (2015) reported that preservice teachers enter teacher preparation programs with underdeveloped pedagogical beliefs that often conflict with one another. For example, a preservice teacher might express constructivist beliefs about student learning while also expressing that teachers are responsible for transmitting knowledge, representing a more teacher-centered belief. Unfortunately, while some preservice teachers appear to be more inclined toward student-centered pedagogies necessary for TEL (Hsu, 2016; Hur et al., 2015; Kale & Akcaoglu, 2018; Smagorinsky & Barnes, 2014), they remain apprehensive about the integration of technology tools into teaching and learning (Batane & Ngwako, 2017; Hur et al., 2015; Lei, 2009; Riegel & Tong, 2017). Additionally, many preservice teachers still hold traditional beliefs about teaching with technology (Tsai & Tsai, 2019), which they take into their classrooms after graduating.

Throughout their programs, preservice teachers have experiences that influence their beliefs and attitudes about how teaching and learning should look, which in turn, inform their intentions to use TEL (Batane & Ngwako, 2017; Kale & Akcaoglu, 2018; Smagorinsky & Barnes, 2014). Since preservice teachers represent the future of the field, particularly given current rates of teacher turnover (Garcia & Weiss, 2019), colleges of education that focus on developing aligned pedagogical and technological beliefs can increase preservice teachers' intention to use TEL through modeling the use of innovative teaching practices and uses of technology. Thus, colleges of education can and should play a crucial role in facilitating a shift in the field to greater use of TEL by developing intention to use TEL that leads to its use when preservice teachers enter the field.

However, if preservice teachers do not experience explicit modeling of TEL in their teacher preparation programs, then it is unlikely that they will develop the intention to use it in their teaching practice. Barak (2017) noted the difference between university faculty members' expectations for preservice teachers' future uses of TEL and faculty members' use of TEL in their practice. The mixed-methods study she conducted revealed that university faculty used web-based technologies far more often for "information management and the distribution of learning materials" (p. 464) than to facilitate constructivist approaches to learning (Barak, 2017). However, the faculty survey results in the study also showed that university faculty expect preservice teachers to use TEL in their future K-12 classrooms to a much greater extent than they are modeling at the university level, signaling a disconnect between the expectations for PreK-12 environments and the realities of instruction in higher education.

In the Common Sense Census, researchers surveyed 1600 tweens and teens, finding that 84% of teens (13–18) own a smartphone, but only 3% of the time spent on that device is used for creating (Rideout & Robb, 2019). This supports findings by Thompson, 2013, Thompson, 2015 that most university students are not taking full advantage of the affordances of digital devices for creating content and constructing knowledge, two key aspects of TEL. If this generation of preservice teachers are not frequently using technology to create and construct knowledge, it follows that they may not feel comfortable using TEL in their future classrooms, despite the growing ubiquity of digital devices in today's PreK-12 classrooms. These findings indicate that the pedagogical and technological beliefs and skills necessary to implement TEL are not innate, not always well modeled by university faculty, and should be investigated to understand the highly complex beliefs, attitudes, and experiences of preservice teachers (Barak, 2017; Kramarski & Michalsky, 2015; Rideout & Robb, 2019; Thompson, 2013; Tsai & Tsai, 2019). Therefore, grounded in the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1985) and research on preservice teachers' intentions regarding technology (Li et al., 2016; Sadaf et al., 2012; Valtonen, Kukkonen, Kontkanen, Dillon, & Sointu, 2015), a model was created to examine the internal, environmental, and program factors associated with preservice teachers' intention to use TEL.

1.1.4. Purpose of the study
The purpose of this predictive correlational study is to investigate to what extent, if at all, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavior control, and program factors predict preservice teachers' intention to use TEL while controlling for demographic variables. Intention to use TEL is the criterion variable. It is generally defined as an indication of how much effort a preservice teacher is willing to exert toward the student-centered use of technology as a cognitive tool to communicate, collaborate, develop critical thinking skills, and solve authentic problems (Ajzen, 1991; Ertmer & Ottenbreit-Leftwich, 2012; Jonassen, 1994, 2005; Nelson & Hawk, 2020).

The predictor variables include the constructs of Ajzen's (1985) Theory of Planned Behavior: attitude toward behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control, and program factors, generally defined as classification and program of study. Attitude toward TEL (ATTEL) is defined as a person's judgments about the use of TEL based on his or her own beliefs and experiences (Ajzen, 1985). Subjective norm (SN) is defined as a person's beliefs about what others think about the use of TEL (Ajzen, 1985). Perceived behavioral control (PBC) is defined as a measure of how easy or difficult a person feels it would be to use TEL (Ajzen, 1991; Cheng, 2019). ATTEL, SN, and PBC are operationally defined as item measures on a valid and reliable TPB survey instrument (Cheon, Lee, Crooks, & Song, 2012; Valtonen et al., 2015). Classification is operationally defined as an undergraduate freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior. Program of study is operationally defined as an elementary/special education major or middle level/secondary major. This study aims to answer the research question: To what extent, if at all, do attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and program factors (i.e., classification and program of study) predict preservice teachers' intention to use TEL?

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Design
A predictive correlational design was used for the study. Previous studies regarding preservice teachers' intentions to use technology have also employed this research design (Cheon et al., 2012; Cullen & Greene, 2011; Gómez-Ramirez, Valencia-Arias, & Duque, 2019; Li et al., 2016; Salleh & Laxman, 2015; Teo, 2009; Teo et al., 2016). Since the present study focuses on preservice teachers, the ability to predict behavioral intention is valuable. Preservice teachers are not currently practicing in a classroom; therefore, intention is the best measure of future action that researchers can obtain concerning preservice teachers' use of TEL. Ajzen (1991; 2002) has established that intention is strongly linked to future actions. However, a complex set of factors impact intention. Measuring the association of attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and program factors provides teacher educators with valuable information for further instructional technology program development, designed to increase intention.

2.2. Participants, setting, and procedures
The sampling frame consisted of preservice teachers currently enrolled in three courses in the college of education (N = 264), and the volunteer rate was 42% (N = 111) after deleting 37 incomplete survey responses. This sample size exceeded Green's (1991) rule of thumb for multiple regression, requiring a minimum sample of 50 participants plus eight multiplied by the number of predictor variables. The majority of participants were White (n = 91, 82%) women (n = 85, 76.6%) under the age of 25 (n = 100, 90.1%). Given the lack of variation across demographic data, gender, ethnicity, and age were not considered in the analysis even though literature has established a gender gap (Cai, Fan, & Du, 2017) and an age gap (Hauk, Huffmeier, & Krumm, 2018) in attitudes toward technology, which contribute to intention.

The study sample was garnered using convenience sampling and snowball sampling in CAEP-accredited college of education undergraduate program(s) at a public state university in the south-eastern United States (Creswell & Guetterman, 2019). The college of education is currently in its fifth year of implementing a 1:1 mobile learning initiative in its undergraduate elementary (123 credit hours), special education (122 credit hours), middle level (121 credit hours), and secondary education programs (18-h minor in conjunction with a content area major). As part of the initiative, students who are fully admitted to the college of education, typically between their sophomore and junior years, purchase an iPad to use in their coursework. The elementary education and special education programs follow similar study and degree plans, as do the middle and secondary programs. Technology integration and learner-centered teaching practices are core mission values within the college. All education majors in these four degree programs must enroll in a stand-alone educational technology integration course shortly after being fully admitted to the college of education.

Upon gaining approval from the study site's institutional review board, we worked with course instructors to integrate the survey as an optional course assignment posted in the learning management system (LMS) across three identified college of education courses during the first two weeks of the Fall 2020 semester. These three courses were an introductory education as a profession course, an educational technology course, and a student teaching course taken in the final semester of students' senior year. Course instructors made it clear that participation in the study was entirely voluntary. These courses were selected for survey distribution because they are included in the degree plans for students in the elementary, special education, middle level, and secondary programs of study. They are taken in different semesters during students' degree completion. Informed consent was obtained from each participant on the first screen of the online survey. No participant names were collected on the survey, and all data were submitted and stored in the encrypted website Qualtrics to protect participants' privacy and data confidentiality (Creswell & Guetterman, 2019). The survey was closed after two weeks. Once the survey window was closed, the data was downloaded from Qualtrics and exported into the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) to conduct analysis (Gall, Gall, & Borg, 2015).

2.3. Instrumentation
This study focused on TPB's three main constructs because the technology-specific variables used in other models focus on the tools themselves rather than behaviors (Ertmer & Ottenbreit-Leftwich, 2012). Some TPB studies measure antecedent beliefs or integrate additional variables from models like TAM or UTAUT (Li et al., 2016; Sadaf et al., 2012; Teo et al., 2016). Since this study focused on a specific behavior (pedagogical practice), and preservice teachers are not currently practicing in classrooms, measuring to what extent the three main TPB constructs (i.e., attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control) as well as program factors, predict behavioral intention was the best fit for this study. Fishbein and Ajzen (2010) stated that there is no single instrument to measure the TPB constructs, and they provide clear guidance regarding the development of questionnaires to measure behavioral intention. We, thus, designed the Intention to Use Technology-Enabled Learning Scale to ascertain preservice teachers' (1) intention to use TEL in their future classrooms, (2) attitudes toward TEL, (3) beliefs regarding subjective norms (i.e., future and present), and (4) perceived behavioral control related to TEL (see Table 1).

The instrument was developed following Fishbein and Ajzen's (2010) guidance and was informed by two validated TPB survey instruments used in TPB studies (Cheon et al., 2012; Valtonen et al., 2015) and TPB/TEL literature (Ajzen, 1991, 2002; Cullen & Greene, 2011; Ertmer & Ottenbreit-Leftwich, 2012; Fishbein & Ajzen, 2010).

Candidate items for each of the four factors were developed. We developed the items following Fishbein and Ajzen's (2010) guidance regarding the development of questionnaires to measure their theory's constructs within specific contexts. We also used Warner's (2013) recommendation to develop initial candidate items, with the end-state instrument's aim, including at least four to five items for each factor. We developed an initial Intention to Use Technology-Enabled Learning Scale candidate pool consisting of 20 items to measure the four factors of intention, attitude toward behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Each item was positively worded, focused on direct measures of the TPB constructs, and used a seven-point, Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree) to score each item following theorists' and researchers' recommendations (Cheon et al., 2012; Fishbein & Ajzen, 2010; Gall et al., 2015; Valtonen et al., 2015).

Following the instrument's development, we identified a panel of three subject matter experts (SME) to evaluate it for both face validity and content validity (Warner, 2013). All panel members had terminal degrees in education and had previously published research relating to TEL and TPB. Additionally, the panel members all had at least three years of experience teaching in teacher education programs. Each panel member received an email containing a draft of the scale, descriptions of the factors the instrument aimed to measure, and a rubric on which members could evaluate each candidate item for content validity, face validity, clarity, conciseness, and reading level (Worthington & Whittaker, 2006). The panel members rated each criterion for each item on a five-point scale (one = very poor; five = very good). The rubric also allowed panel members to provide open responses, explaining their ratings of any item receiving a score lower than five and providing suggestions for recommended changes, additions, or deletions. The experts emailed their completed rubrics back to us.

Upon receiving the rubrics, we calculated the mean score for each candidate item (Gall, Gall, & Borg, 2007), and any items with an average score below four across all criteria were deleted. One item was deleted. We also reviewed the experts' comments, using open coding to identify improvement themes (Creswell, 2013). The items were adjusted based on improvement themes, and two items were added. The resulting instrument had 22 items, including four items measuring intention, five items measuring attitudes, seven items measuring subjective norms (three for present and four for future), and six items measuring perceived behavioral control. The expert review confirmed good face and content validity, and Cronbach's α coefficient was calculated for each sub-scale establishing good instrument reliability (e.g., attitude = 0.93, intention = 0.93; perceived behavior control = 0.88, subjective norm future = 0.85, subjective norm present = .89) (Creswell & Guetterman, 2019).

Additionally, Sadaf et al. (2012) noted that more studies are needed to "examine how experience contributes to the variance in [preservice teachers'] attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control" (p. 189). Hence, as noted, this study also explored the addition of program factors to the predictive model alongside the TPB constructs. The categorical and ordinal variables for program factors were measured by two items regarding classification and program of study in the second part of the survey (Gall et al., 2015). Participants could self-report their classification as freshman (1), sophomore (2), junior (3), or senior (4). They could self-report their program of study as Elementary (K-6), Special Education (K-6), Middle Level (4–7), Secondary (7-12), or Other. The Other designation was meant to capture participants enrolled in K-12 certification areas such as Art Education and Physical Education. This categorical variable was dummy coded, with elementary and special education program students being coded as 0 and middle and secondary program students being coded as 1.

3. Results
A hierarchical multiple regression (HMR) was used to examine the association between preservice teachers' attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and program factors (i.e., classification and program of study) to predict preservice teachers' intention to use TEL while considering program factors (e.g., classification and program of study). A hierarchical multiple regression was chosen as it examines both the combined and individual effects of the predictor variables on the criterion variable, intention to use TEL (Gall et al., 2015). While many quantitative studies regarding technology acceptance and intention use more advanced statistical measures, such as structural equation modeling (SEM) and path analysis (Cheon et al., 2012; Sadaf et al., 2012; Teo, 2012; Teo et al., 2016), others have employed a multiple regression analysis (Cullen & Greene, 2011; Li et al., 2016). Gall et al. (2015) noted that "multiple regression is a powerful statistical procedure for determining which combination of independent variables, if any, lead to better predictions than any single variable" (p. 273). Therefore, the use of a hierarchical multiple regression was appropriate to identify the statistical significance and effect size variance of the predictor variables in this study (Creswell & Guetterman, 2019). All analyses were conducted using the statistical software IBM SPSS version 27. Descriptive statistics for the predictor variables and criterion variables are reported in Table 2.

The results of the correlation analyses demonstrated (e.g., Pearson's r, Spearman's rho, point-biserial correlation) that a significant association existed between each predictor or control variable and the criterion variable (see Table 3). While most of the bivariate correlation coefficients between the predictor variables were significant, the majority had small to moderate effect sizes based on Cohen's (1992) conventions, indicating that multicollinearity was not a problem.

Before conducting the HMR, assumption testing was completed. No assumption violations were found, indicating that the HMR was appropriate for analyzing the data set. When examining the program variable, the results of the HMR indicated that the linear combination of these variables (Model 1) significantly predicted preservice teachers' intention to use technology-enabled learning, R2 = 0.101 (adjusted R2 = 0.084), F (2, 108) = 6.04, p = .003. Students’ classification made an individual significant contribution in explaining the variance in their intention, p = .001 (β = -.920). As preservice teachers progressed in their programs, their intention to use technology decreased.

When the theoretical variables (i.e., attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm-future and present) were considered in addition to the program variables, the HMR results demonstrated that the linear combination of all the variables (Model 2) provided a better predictive model than the program variables alone. The combination of program and theoretical variables significantly predicted preservice teachers’ intention to use technology-enabled learning, R2 = 0.653 (adjusted R2 = 0.632), F (6, 104) = 32.44, p > .001. Moreover, the addition of theoretical variables to the model led to a statistically significant increase, R2 change of 0.551, F (4,104) = 41.16, p < .001. While the first model (Model 1) explained 10% of the variability in preservice teachers' intention to use technology-enabled learning, the second model (Model 2) explained 65.3% of this criterion variable variance. Table 4 demonstrates that each theoretical variable, except subjective norm, made significant individual contributions to the model explaining the variance in preservice teachers' intention to use technology-enabled learning. If preservice teachers have more positive attitudes toward technology-enabled learning and perceive that they have control over the use of technology-enabled learning in their future classrooms, then they express a stronger intention to use technology-enabled learning in their future classrooms. It is also significant to note that in the second model, the program variables no longer made individual significant contributions in explaining the variance in intention to use technology-enabled learning, suggesting an interaction between program and theoretical variables. In future studies, more complex modeling and analysis is needed to better understand the interaction among all the variables and how they influence intention to use TEL.

4. Discussion
The findings of this study cohere with and extend previous research regarding preservice teachers' intention to use technology, which suggested have positive attitudes toward technology and a strong sense of personal control over the decision to use technology positively contribute to intention to use technology in their future classrooms (Cullen & Greene, 2011; Li et al., 2016; Sadaf et al., 2012; Valtonen et al., 2015). In this study, the results demonstrated that the program and theoretical variables predicted preservice teachers' intention to use TEL. Examination of individual contributors to the results demonstrated that first-year students were more likely than upper-level students to report that they intended to use TEL in their future classrooms.

While this is surprising, one possible explanation for this finding is that freshmen education majors, having completed less coursework and field experience, hold a more naïve view of the complexities of classroom practice. Thus, they have attitudes and norms that are less informed by experience than upper-level students. Upperclassmen, especially those completing early field experience and student teaching, may report less intention because they are experiencing field placements in which TEL is not used or valued, thus leading to lower intention among upper-level preservice teachers to use TEL themselves (Han, Shin, & Ko, 2017; Nelson & Hawk, 2020). The implications of these findings support previous research suggesting that colleges of education must seek to act as “units of change” (Tondeur et al., 2012, p. 143) and model the use of TEL at a program-deep and program-wide level if they are to positively impact preservice teachers’ attitudes and control beliefs regarding TEL. Because this study found that intention to use TEL decreases as preservice teachers move into upper-level coursework, it is possible that the faculty at the study site are not modeling TEL in their own teaching, aligning with the findings of Barak (2017).

Moreover, consistent with theoretical research, preservice teachers' intention to use TEL increased as their attitudes toward TEL became more positive. Their intention also increased as they perceived more control to use TEL in their future classrooms. However, subjective norm, future and present, did not significantly explain, on its own, preservice teachers' intention to use TEL. This is consistent with findings in previous TPB studies regarding preservice teachers' intentions to use various types of technology (Cullen & Greene, 2011; Gretter & Yadav, 2018).

While this study extends the literature by examining program factors and provides implications for teacher educators seeking to increase intention to use TEL, it is important to acknowledge that this study has limitations and that future research is needed. This was a predictive correlational study which used a hierarchical multiple regression. Thus, only associations among variables can be asserted. Further research with more complex modeling could be pursued to understand better the interaction of all the variables in this model, particularly those that were not significant.

Additionally, this study's variables were measured using self-report items so that self-report bias may have been present. The use of TEL may be considered by preservice teachers to fall into the category of desired behaviors. Thus, they may have over-reported positive attitudes or intentions, based on what they perceived researchers would hope to hear (Brenner & DeLamater, 2016). More objective measures, such as observation of actual use of TEL, could be employed in future studies. The use of convenience sampling was another limitation of the study, leading to a lack of diversity among the sample participants. While the lack of diversity among educators continues to be a persistent problem (NCES, 2019), this study sample was made up almost entirely of White women under 25. A more diverse sample may have yielded different results. Future studies could employ more purposeful sampling procedures with the aim of increasing diversity within the study sample.

Finally, this study examined the intention to use TEL rather than the actual use of TEL. Future studies should explore how preservice teachers’ intent to use TEL transfers into their actual teaching practice during student teaching and into the induction period of teaching as early career educators. Qualitative methods could be used to explore this phenomenon in more depth and detail.

5. Conclusions
Results of this study indicated that both program factors and theoretical variables predict preservice teachers' intention to use TEL. Together, programmatic and theoretical variables (Model 2) explained 65.3% of the variance in preservice teachers' intention to use TEL. Further, the variables of classification, attitude, and perceived behavioral control made significant individual contributions in explaining the variance in intention to use TEL. However, as preservice teachers gain knowledge and experience in their programs of study, their intention to use TEL decreases. This indicates that if teacher education programs want to encourage preservice teachers to adopt TEL, then they must ensure that they are modeling such practices at a program-deep and program-wide level (Buss, Wetzel, Foulger, & Lindsey, 2015; Tondeur et al., 2012). Best practices in pedagogy and educational technology use continue to evolve; however, many classrooms continue to lag in adoption of these strategies and tools (Barak, 2017; Scherer & Teo, 2019; Tondeur et al., 2016). Identifying the specific variables that positively contribute to intention gives colleges of education a clear focus around which to design interventions to increase intention to use TEL by the time preservice teacher graduate and enter the field.
