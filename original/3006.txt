The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of first aid training in live online classes using the problem-based learning approach on students' learning achievement, problem-solving skills, communication skill, and interaction. The pre-test and post-test quasi-experimental design with a control group was used in the quantitative dimension of the study. The study group was conducted with forty-five university students. While live online classes in the experimental group were carried out via the PBL approach, live online classes in the control group were traditionally carried out via teacher-based methods without any intervention. Zoom application was used in both groups during live online classes. Group work in the experimental group was conducted using breakout rooms. The process of data collection and the experimental procedure of the study was completed in six weeks. Within the scope of the study, courses took three 40 min periods every week. The Learning Achievement Test, the Perceived Problem-solving Skills Scale, the Communication Skills Scale, and the Online Course Interaction Level Determination Scale were used for data collection tools. The results of study show that students who attended live online classes using PBL had higher levels of learning achievement, problem-solving skills and live online class interaction than students who attended live online classes using teacher-based methods. No significant difference between the communication skills of the groups was observed.

1. Introduction
Scientific knowledge is increasingly produced and access to knowledge is independent of time and place. This situation nowadays causes the profile of literate individuals to be redefined (Trilling & Fadel, 2009). Today's effectiveness of and easy access to knowledge increase the need for a flexible and solution-oriented workforce. In this context, problem-solving skills are considered as one of the critical skills of the twenty-first century (Kuo, Hwang, & Lee, 2012; Özyurt, 2015; Phungsuk, Viriyavejakul, & Ratanaolarn, 2017). Sternberg (1988) supports the view that problem-solving skills involve different skills, such as defining the nature of the problem, choosing problem-solving steps, choosing problem-solving strategies, selecting appropriate information, allocating appropriate sources, and monitoring the problem-solving process. Problem-based learning (PBL) comes first among many approaches used to acquire problem-solving skills. The first PBL implementations were seen at Case W. University Medical School in the United States of America in the 1950s. Today, PBL is applied to various scales, branches and courses in different countries throughout the world (Hmelo-Silver, 2004).

Problem-based learning, which is also utilized by the constructivist approach along with many other approaches (Hendry, Frommer, & Walker, 1999; Savery, 2015), is organized around problem-solving and reasoning (Trop & Sage, 2002). To John Dewey, PBL is based on progressivism which gives students an opportunity to solve problems by engaging them in real-world problems (Dolmans, De Grave, Wolfhagen, & Van Der Vleuten, 2005). PBL, as a student-centered approach, is designed to facilitate collaborative learning and to encourage students for deep learning (Hack, McKillop, Sweetman, & McCormack, 2015).

In recent years, web-based problem-solving activities have attracted considerable interest and many studies have been conducted in this field. In these studies, synchronous and asynchronous tools are integrated into PBL by using various variables (Ding & Zhang, 2018; Liu, Du, Zhang, & Zhou, 2019; Phungsuk et al., 2017; Virtanen & Rasi, 2017). In addition to this, web-based problem-solving activities are found to have a positive effect on many variables; a number of studies have shown that it is easy for students to become disorientated without any help or guidance while searching for information online (Chandra & Watters, 2012; Hwang & Kuo, 2011; Kim & Hannafin, 2011). In this context, Hwang, Kuo, Chen, and Ho (2014) emphasize that effective tools should be provided in order to prevent students from disorientation while searching for information on the Internet and help them organize the information they have accessed. Unlike other studies, in this study, LOC especially with the COVID-19 epidemic, have been integrated into PBL. On the other hand, most studies in the literature have shown that various of software is developed to be integrated into PBL (Ding & Zhang, 2018; Hwang et al., 2014; Lin, Yu, Hsiao, Chang, & Chien, 2020; Malik, Mathew, & Hammood, 2019). This study prefers a live online class platform, which can be used free of charge by everyone. This situation ensures the replicability of the study.

Considering the studies focused on PBL, it is seen that many variables were examined as dependent variables such as learning achievement (Ding & Zhang, 2018), programming skills (Malik et al., 2019), motivation (Aslan & Duruhan, 2020), and cognitive load (Larmuseau, Cornelis, Lancieri, ). On the other hand, problem-solving skills (Winayus, Mariani, & Sukestiyarno, 2020), interaction (Ding & Zhang, 2018), and communication skills are examined separately as dependent variables in some studies. In this context, the examination of problem-solving skills, communication skills, and interaction altogehter in a study can make important contributions to the literature.

Interaction is one of the limitations of distance education which is widely used throughout the pandemic (Cheng & Chau, 2016; Holmberg, 2005). In the literature, studies show that interaction in distance education is not at the desired level (Agudo-Peregrina, Iglesias-Pradas, Conde-Gonz; Al-Musharraf & Alkhattabi, 2016). In this context, Owusu-Agyeman and Larbi-Siaw (2018) express that there is a need for studies to increase interaction in distance education. The scenarios and group work included in PBL activities enable students to interact with both their teachers and other students. Indeed, considering the limited number of practical studies in the literature (Li, Wang, Zhu, Zhu, & Sun, 2019), there is a need to examine students’ problem-solving skills, communication skills, and interaction skills as suggested by Huang, Huang, Wu, Chen, and Chang (2016) and Owusu-Agyeman and Larbi-Siaw (2018).

The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of technology supported PBL in a first aid training thorugh LOC, on students' learning achievement, problem solving-skills, communication skills, and interaction.

2. Literature review
2.1. Problem based learning
The PBL approach is an instructional method that guides students to solve real-world problems (Savery, 2015; Torp & Sage, 2002). It is expected that problem situations in PBL are not well-structured problems which reflect students' real-world circumstances and that students find solutions for problems by taking an active role in the process (Finkle & Torp, 1995). It can be seen that PBL is effective in facilitating students’ learning (Aktı Aslan & Duruhan; Dochy, Segers, Van den Bossche, & Gijbels, 2003) and in increasing real-life competencies and motivation for courses (Hallinger & Lu, 2011) when compared to traditional teaching methods. There are several factors that make PBL difficult to implement: the time it takes for teachers to prepare course materials, the difficulty of controlling more than one group at the same time (bib_Albanese_and_Mitchell_1993Albanese & Mitchell, 1993), already developed curriculum which is not suitable for PBL (Nicholl & Lou, 2012), and the difficulties in organizing information students collect for a problem situation (Savery & Duffy, 1995). In this approach, students encounter a problem through scenario-based situations. Scenarios play an important role in the learning process. Teachers who prefer to use the PBL approach should know how to create scenarios related to the subject they will deal with and the expected characteristics of the scenarios. Scenarios should be simple, clear, and not well-structured in a way that students can encounter them in daily life (Hmelo-Silver, 2004). In the current literature, it is seen that different steps are emphasized for the PBL process. According to Hmelo-Silver (2004), this process consists of several stages as presenting problem scenarios, identifying the problem, generating hypotheses, identifying knowledge deficiencies, applying new knowledge, abstracting, and evaluating. With the development of technology, PBL environments are also facilitated through technologies.

2.2. Technology supported PBL
Online learning environments have a significant potential for the acquisition of skills that children need (Tareef, 2014) and for problem-solving (Phungsuk et al., 2017). In the extant literature, it can be seen that PBL is frequently-used with various technologies (Lajoie et al., 2014; Phungsuk et al., 2017; Virtanen & Rasi, 2017) since instructional technologies can supply the requirements of PBL, such as communication and collaboration (Duch, Groh, & Allen, 2001). In addition, teachers' guidance for their students (Gould, Sadera, & McNary, 2015) and students’ access to knowledge they need quickly and easily (Chin & Chia, 2004) are requirements of PBL and these can be supported through instructional technologies. Hung, Jonassen, and Liu (2008) suggest that PBL can be integrated into online environments or supplemented with various multimedia, such as audio, video, and animation. Indeed, the results of various studies have shown that PBL is integrated into online environments (Kuo et al., 2012; Hwang, Wu, & Chen, 2012; Phungsuk et al., 2017; Tomaz, Mamede, Filho, Roriz Filho, & van der Molen, 2015; Ong-art & Jintavee, 2016).

Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, synchronous tools have begun to be preferred more for distance education. Live online classes are one of them. Teachers and students can synchronously share texts, audios, images, screens, and whiteboards in live online classes. In the literature, live online classes are expressed in many different ways such, as live classroom, live virtual classroom/classes, online classes/courses, and live virtual classes. The expression ‘live online classes’ (LOC) is preferred for this study.

3. Research hypotheses
3.1. Student learning achievement in LOC using PBL
The results of the studies in the literature have shown that web-based problem-solving, or, in other words, technology-supported PBL, has a positive effect on students' cognitive and affective development (Liu et al., 2019; Tomaz, Mamede, Coelho Filho, de S Roriz Filho, & van der Molen, 2015; Ong-art & Jintavee, 2016). Additionaly, Phungsuk et al. (2017) emphasize that students actively participate in learning activities with technology-supported PBL. Besides, studies in the literature have shown that PBL positively affects students’ motivation (Kassem, 2018; LaForce, Noble, & Blackwell, 2017). It is thought that technology-supported PBL positively affects the cognitive and affective development of students (Liu et al., 2019; Tomaz et al., 2015; Ong-art & Jintavee, 2016), ensures the active participation of students in the course (Ji, Park, Jo, & Lim, 2016; Hawkins, Graham, Sudweeks, & Barbour, 2013) and increases their motivation (Harnett, 2016) towards the course. The following hypothesis is proposed on the basis of studies in the literature.

H1

The learning achievement level is higher for students who attend LOC with PBL than for students who attend LOC with teacher-centered instruction.

3.2. Problem-solving skills in LOC using PBL
Recently, PBL has been regularly used to develop problem-solving skills of students (Gallagher & Gallagher, 2013; Liu et al., 2014; Phungsuk et al., 2017). The fact that ill-structured problems do not have only one solution is critical for students to advance their arguments and discuss their solutions, which, in turn, develops students' problem solving skills (Cho & Jonassen, 2002). In addition, Uribe, Klein, and Sullivan (2003) emphasize that problem-solving in group activities is more effective than in individual activities. Studies also found that technology-based PBL facilitate students’ problem solving skills (Phungsuk vd., 2017; Valentine, Belski, & Hamilton, 2017). Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed on the basis of studies in the literature.

H2

The advancement in problem solving skills is higher for students who attend LOC with PBL than for students who attend LOC with teacher-centered instruction.

3.3. Communication skills in LOC using PBL
In the literature, studies indicate that PBL can help students improve their communication skills (Hill, 2012; Cerezo, 2004; L'Ecuyer, Pole, & Leander, 2015). Synchronous applications in distance education are particularly suitable for brainstorming and group work (Valaitis, Sword, Jones, & Hodges, 2005). In addition, Ding and Zhang (2018) state that web-based PBL can provide an effective communication between teachers and students. Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed on the basis of studies in the literature.

H3

The increase in students' communication skills is higher for students who attend LOC with PBL than for students who attend LOC with teacher-centered instruction.

3.4. Interaction in LOC using PBL
Although distance education applications have many advantages, they also have limitations. Among these limitations, the first one is interaction (Anderson, 2003; Cheng & Chau, 2016; Holmberg, 2005; Moore, 1993). For successful distance education, interaction regarding learner, instructor, and content should be conducted in a planned and regular manner (Holmberg & Wedemeyer, 1989). The results of studies have shown that interaction in distance education cannot be achieved at the desired level (Agudo-Peregrina et al., 2014; Al-Musharraf & Alkhattabi, 2016; Turgut & Karal, 2015). The limited communication among instructor and students (Zhang, Zhang, Zou, & Huang, 2018) and lack of instant feedback (Hernández-García, GonzálezGonzález, Jiménez-Zarco, & Chaparro-Peláe, 2015) are the two factors influencing the interaction in distance education. In this context, PBL provides an opportunity for students to discuss a problem within groups and for teachers to give instant feedback to students. Considering that this opportunity increase the interaction level, the following hypothesis is proposed:

H4

The interaction level of students who attend LOC with PBL is higher than the interaction level of students who attend LOC with teacher-centered instruction.

4. Methodology
4.1. Participants and context
The study group consisted of forty-five students from two classes of a university located in a province with a medium socio-economic level in the eastern part of Turkey. All of the students who participated in the study conducted in 2020 was received their approval for participating in the study. Of the students, twenty (40%) were male and twenty-five (55%) were female. Besides, the ages of the students range from 18 to 25. When the creation of experimental and control groups are not randomly assigned in experimental studies, it should be ensured that the groups have similar characteristics in terms of the mix of student attributes as far as possible (McMillan & Schumacher, 2010). In this context, pre-tests were used to determine whether the groups were similar to each other in terms of learning achievement, problem-solving skills, and communication skills. A learning achievement test developed by the researcher, the perceived problem-solving skills scale developed by Armour-Thomas and Haynes (1988) and adapted into Turkish by Masal, Takunyacı, and Gülay (2013), and the communication skills scale developed by Korkut and Bugay (2014) were used as pre-tests. Since the data showed normal distribution (p > .05) as a result of the Shapiro-Wilk test, the independent samples t-test was performed. The obtained results are presented in Table 1.


Table 1. The t-test results for the pre-test scores of the groups.

Dependent Variable	Groups	N	
 
SS	sd	t	p
Learning Achievement	Group-1	20	40.75	14.25	43	.129	.898
Group-2	25	40.2	14.1
Perceived Problem-Solving Skills Scale	Group-1	20	86.30	7.88	43	-.856	.396
Group-2	25	88.36	8.11
Communication Skills	Group-1	20	97.65	8.659	43	−1.876	.067
Group-2	25	102.84	9.647
In accordance with the results of the analysis in Table 1, no significant difference was observed between the groups in terms of learning achievement scores [t(43) = 0.129; p > .05], problem-solving skills [t(43) = -0.862; p > .05], and communication skills [t(43) = -1.876; p > .05]. Therefore, through random assignment, Group-1 consisting of twenty students was determined as the experimental group and Group-2 consisting of twenty-five students was determined as the control group.

4.2. Experimental procedure
A pre-test and post-test quasi-experimental design with a control group was used in the quantitative dimension of the study. Zoom application was used in both groups in LOC. The data collection and experimental procedures of the study were completed in six weeks. The experimental procedure is summarized in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. Experimental procedure.

As illustrated in Fig. 1, groups were determined by administering pre-tests in the first week of the study. Both groups received instruction related to first aid. The first aid training consisted of four objectives; therefore, every week, students received instruction related to each objective. The objectives and the number of items in the learning achievement test to measure the related objectives are provided in Table 2. The course content in both groups was prepared in line with objectives related to first aid training. The 40-min three classes were held every week.


Table 2. The distribution of test items according to course objectives.

4.1 Render first aid in case of airway obstruction: Know the symptoms and types of airway obstruction. Know how to perform the Heimlich maneuver depend on adults, infants, and people who lost their conscious.	7,8,12, 13,14
Both groups were informed about the aim, and objectives of the course before the process started. While LOC in the experimental group were carried out via the PBL approach, LOC in the control group were carried out via teacher-based instruction without any intervention. After the experimental procedures were completed, the Learning Achievement Test, the Problem-Solving Skills Scale and the Scale for Determining the Level of LOC Interaction were administered as post-tests. The learning achievement test was administered to both groups one more time to measure the permanence of learning three weeks after the experimental procedures were completed.

4.3. The design of the PBL activities in LOC
Scenarios inspired by real-life contexts underlie the PBL activities. Many studies put strong emphasis on characteristics of scenarios and problem situations (Goodnough, 2011; Hmelo-Silver, 2004; Ram, 1999). By taking these characteristics into consideration, four scenarios for each objective were developed by the researcher. An expert opinion form with eight basic characteristics was used to evaluate the developed scenarios. Four experts, who were experienced in PBL and first aid training, evaluated the scenarios. The average scores for each scenario are presented in Table 3.


Table 3. Expert opinion form results for PBL scenarios.

Evaluate scenarios with a score ranging from 1 to 3 by considering the specified characteristics	S1	S2	S3	S4

The problem was designed for students' higher-order thinking.	2,75	2,75	3	3
S: Scenario				
According to Table 3, it is seen that scenarios have the desired characteristics according to the experts' views. The lowest score was obtained for the item ‘the problem is simple and clear’. Therefore, corrections were completed to make scenarios simpler and more clear in line with the feedback received from the experts. A sample scenario prepared for ‘first aid for injuries’ is shown in Fig. 2:

Fig. 2. A sample scenario.

After the creation of scenarios, another important factor for the PBL process is group work. If group formation is not well-designed, this can negatively affect the learning experience (Alfonseca, Carro, Martín, Ortigosa, & Paredes, 2006). It is recommended that groups are created randomly (Chan et al., 2010) by the teacher who considers students' demands (Hilton & Phillips, 2010). In addition, individual differences within the groups should be maximized by paying attention to characteristics of group members (Moreno, Ovalle, & Vicari, 2012). Four groups with five members were created by considering students’ pre-test scores.

In the literature, the PBL approach was implemented using different steps (Lu, Bridges, & Hmelo-Silver, 2014; Moust, van Berkel, & Schmidt, 2005; Simons & Ertmer, 2005; Schulkin, 2009). For this study, the six-stage process was followed, which was adapted by Fidan and Tuncel (2019) based on the studies of Donnelly (2005), Lu et al. (2014), Torp and Sage (2002), and Uden and Beaumont (2006a, 2006b). The stages of the PBL process are presented in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3. The PBL process (Fidan & Tuncel, 2019).

The PBL process started with the introduction of scenarios using the Zoom application. After the scenarios and problem situations were shared with all of the students, the breakout rooms were created for each group of students to work. In the breakout rooms, students use varsious technical facilities needed in LOC including audio, image, screen, and file sharing. The teacher can navigate the breakout rooms and guide group discussions. In addition, each student in the group is encouraged and guided for collaboration in order to ensure efficient group work. In the group work, students were primarily guided to define the problem presented in the scenario. Then, group members identified the information which was needed for the problem solution and worked for data gathering by helping each other and sharing. Each group developed solutions to the problem on the basis of their previous knowledge and newly-obtained information. Each group representative defined the problem situation and shared their group's solution proposals with the other groups. The proposed solutions were discussed with the participation of all students. Acceptable solutions for the problem situation were finalized. Therefore, the PBL activity for one objective was completed. This process was repeated for each objective. An example scene from one of the breakout rooms is presented in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4. An example of breakout rooms.

Courses in the control group lasted for 4 weeks. As in the experimental group, the 40-min three classes were held in LOC every week. The courses in the control group have the same learning objectives as the experimental group. No intervention was done to the course design in the control group. The instructor generally used the methods (e.i., direct instruction, case study, question-answer) that he preferred to use. In this context, direct instruction, case studies and question-answer methods were generally used in the control group. In the first course each week, the lecturer taught with a presentation he prepared by using the direct instruction method. In the second and third courses, he also completed the course by using the case study and the question-answer method. Thus, the courses in the control group continued during four weeks.

4.4. Measuring tools
4.4.1. Learning achievement test
In order to test participants' learning achievement, the learning achievement test was developed by the researcher to measure whether students gain the objectives. The researcher created a question pool with 10 questions for each objective, which makes 40 questions in total. After obtaining three experts’ opinions, five questions were revised. A pilot study was conducted with 200 university students. The item difficulty index (pj) and the item discrimination index (rj) were calculated. Seventeen questions with an item discrimination index below 0.30 and three questions with an incompatible item difficulty index were excluded from the test. As a result, there were a total of 20 questions in the learning achievement test (see Fig. 5 for an example question).

Fig. 5. An example multiple-choice question.

On average, the item discrimination index of the learning achievement test was calculated as 0.47, the item difficulty index was calculated as 0.58, and the internal consistency coefficient (KR-20) was calculated as 0.77. The learning achievement test was used as pre-test, post-test and delayed post-test.

4.4.2. Perceived problem-solving skills scale
In the study, the Student Thinking about Problem Solving Scale, which was developed by Armour-Thomas and Haynes (1988) and was later adapted into Turkish by Masal et al. (2013), was used to measure students' problem-solving skills. The five-point Likert type scale consists of twenty-three items in three sub-dimensions; planning, organizing, and evaluating. The Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient of the scale was calculated as 0.86 (Masal et al., 2013). In addition, for the sub-dimensions of the scale, the reliability coefficients were calculated to be 0.87 for ‘planning’, 0.74 for ‘organizing’, and 0.72 for ‘evaluating’ (Masal et al., 2013).

4.4.3. Communication skills scale
In the study, the Communication Skills Scale developed by Owen Korkut and Bugay (2014) was used to measure students' communication skills. The five-point Likert type scale consists of twenty-five items. The Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient of the scale was calculated as 0.88 (Owen Korkut & Bugay, 2014). The scale has four sub-dimensions; ‘Communication Principles and Basic Skills’, ‘Self-Expression’, ‘Active Listening and Non-Verbal Communication’, and ‘Willingness to Communicate’. The reliability coefficients for the sub-dimensions of the scale were calculated to be 0.79, 0.72, 0.64, and 0.71, respectively (Owen Korkut & Bugay, 2014).

4.4.4. Online Course Interaction Level Determination Scale
In the study, the Online Course Interaction Level Determination Scale developed by Karaman (2015) was used as a post-test in order to measure the level of students' live online class interaction. The scale was five-point Likert type and consists of twenty-five items. The Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient of the scale was calculated as 0.89 (Karaman, 2015). The scale has four sub-dimensions; ‘Student’, ‘Teacher’, ‘Content’ and ‘Presentation Style’. The reliability coefficients for the sub-dimensions of the scale were calculated as 0.92, 0.68, 0.66, and 0.46, respectively (Karaman, 2015).

4.5. Data analysis
Descriptive and inferential statistics were used in the analysis of the data. In order to determine which statistics were to be used, it was first examined whether the data showed a normal distribution or not. For this purpose, the Shapiro-Wilk test was preferred since the sample group was below fifty (Shapiro & Wilk, 1965). After it was determined that the data was normally distributed (p > .05), an independent samples t-tests, ANCOVA, and ANOVA were performed. In statistical analysis, the significance level was accepted as p < .05.

5. Results
5.1. Student learning achievement in LOC using PBL (H1)
In order to determine whether there was a significant difference between the post-test learning achievement scores of the experimental and control groups (H1) analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was performed. The assumption for the homogeneity of variance related to ANCOVA [F(1,43) = 2.998, p > .05; % 95 CI.] and the assumption for equality of regression slopes [F(1,45) = 0.31, p > .05; % 95 CI.] were examined. It was determined that the data was compatible for ANCOVA. The adjusted post-test mean scores according to the pre-test scores of the groups are presented in Table 4.


Table 4. The adjusted post-test learning achievement mean sores of the experimental and control groups.

Group	N	M	Adjusted Mean
Experimental Group	20	67.00	67.04
Control Group	25	49.00	48.99
ANCOVA was performed to test whether the difference between groups’ learning achievement post-test scores was significant. The obtained results are presented in Table 5.


Table 5. ANCOVA results for the adjusted learning achievement post-test scores according to the pre-test scores of the experimental and control groups.

Source	Sum of squares	Df	Mean square	F	p	eta-square (H2)
Pre-test	1.809	1	1.809	.005	.946	.000
Group	3601.783	1	3601.783	9.385	.004	.1083
Error	16118.191	42	383.766			
Total	19720.000	44				
According to Table 5, it can be seen that there was a significant difference between the adjusted post-test scores according to the students' learning achievement pre-test scores [F(1, 42) = 9.385, p < .05; 95% CI].

The two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used to determine whether the difference in the pre-test, post-test, and delayed post-test learning achievement scores of the experimental and control groups was statistically significant. Some assumptions need to be met in order to conduct analysis of variance for repeated measures. One of these, named Mauchly's Test of Sphericity, was used to examine whether the assumption of sphericity was violated (Gamst, Meyers, & Guarino, 2008). The results of the Mauchly's Test of Sphericity show that the obtained values at different times do not satisfy to the assumption of sphericity for repeated measurements (W₍₂₎ = 0.76, p < .05). Since the assumption of sphericity is not statistically satisfied, the univariate analysis approach was preferred. The data was obtained from the variance test by applying the Greenhouse-Geisser correction (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2015).

Another assumption required for repeated measurements is the equality of the variances of the groups' scores obtained at the same time (Büyükö). The homogeneity of the variances of scores obtained from pre-test, post-test, and delayed post-test of the experimental and control groups was examined through the Levene test. According to the results of the analysis, the obtained values for pre-test (F = 0.448, p > .05), for post-test (F = 2.16, p > .05), and for delayed post-test (F = 0.07, p > .05) show that variances between the groups were homogeneous. In the study, Box's M test was used to test the equality of covariance matris for the dependent variable. As a result of Box's M test, it was observed that the multivariate normality assumption was statistically satisfied for learning achievement (Box's M = 11.968, p > .05). Based on the obtained analysis results, it was thought that the necessary assumptions were met in order to conduct the two-factor ANOVA test for repeated measurements. The ANOVA results are presented in Table 6.

According to Table 6, it can be seen that the group effect was significant [F(1,44) = 13.77; p < .05]. It was determined that the difference between mean scores of the students' learning achievement in pre-tests, post-tests, and delayed post-tests was also significant, regardless of the group separation [F(2,86) = 19.77; p < .05]. In addition, the determined common effect (group * time) value in this study was also significant [F(2,86) = 5.59; p < .05].

The Bonferroni test was used to determine any significant differences related to the measurements between groups. The results are presented in Table 7. The Bonferroni test was preferred as it does not require the equal sample condition and it presents the determined difference between groups and the significance level of the difference without error types I and II (Miller, 1969).

According to Table 7, it was determined that there was no significant difference (3.25, p > .05) between post-test mean scores (x̄ = 67.00) and delayed post-test mean scores (x̄ = 63.75) of the experimental group. a similar result was found for the difference (2.84, p > .05) between post-test mean scores (x̄ = 49.00) and delayed post -test mean scores (x̄ = 46.16) of the control group.

According to the change graphic, it can be seen that the delayed post test scores for students' learning achievement in the experimental and control groups decreased in comparison with the post-test scores. Additionally, it is determined that the delayed post-test scores for learning achievement of both experimental and control groups was higher than the pre-test scores. In line with the analysis results, the hypothesis (H1) is accepted.

5.2. Problem-solving skills in LOC using PBL (H2)
In order to test the second hypothesis (H2) the analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was used. The assumption for homogeneity of variance related to ANCOVA [F(1,43) = 2.998, p > .05; 95% CI.] and the assumption for the equality of regression slopes [F(1,45) = 0.30, p > .05; 95% CI.] were examined. It was determined that the data was compatible for ANCOVA. The adjusted post-test mean scores according to the pre-test scores of the groups are presented in Table 8.

According to Table 9, it can be seen that there was a significant difference between the adjusted post-test scores according to the students' pre-test scores [F(1, 42) = 4.647, p < .05; 95% CI]. Within the framework of the findings, the hypothesis (H2) is accepted.

5.3. Communication skills in LOC using PBL (H3)
In order to test the third hypothesis (H3) the analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was performed. The assumption for homogeneity of variance related to ANCOVA [F(1,43) = 0.244, p > .05; %95 CI.] and the assumption for the equality of regression slopes [F(1,45) = 0.070, p > .05; %95 CI.] were examined. It was determined that the data was compatible for ANCOVA. The adjusted post-test mean scores according to the pre-test scores of the groups are presented in Table 10.

According to Table 11, it can be seen that there was no significant difference between the adjusted communication skills post-test scores of the students according to the pre-test scores [F(1,42) = 2.403, p > .05; %95 CI]. Therefore, the hypothesis (H3) is rejected.

5.4. Interaction in LOC using PBL (H4)
In order to test the fourth hypothesis (H4) an independent samples t-test was conducted since the data showed normal distribution (p > .05) as a result of the Shapiro-Wilk test. The obtained results are presented in Table 12.

According to Table 12, it can be seen that there was significant difference between the interaction level post-test scores of the groups [t(43) = 3.881; p < .05]. Therefore, the hypothesis (H4) is accepted.

6. Discussion and conclusions
The results of the study revealed that students' learning achievement in the experimental group was significantly higher than that of students in the control group. This result support the findings of the other studies showing that technology-supported PBL significantly affects students' learning achievement (Figueira & Rocha, 2014; Virtanen & Rasi, 2017; Liu et al., 2014, 2019). On the other hand, there are also studies showing no significant effect of technology-supported PBL on students' learning achievement (Şendağ & Odabaşı; Ding & Zhang, 2018). The PBL process consists of many critical stages including planning, preparation, implementation, and evaluation. A problem in any of these stages can affect the entire process and, as a result, the success of PBL since these stages are interconnected. Specifically, many studies in the literature place emphasis on identifying the characteristics that scenarios should have (Goodnough, 2011; Hmelo-Silver, 2004). For instance, problem situations in scenarios need to profoundly reflect real-life contextsstudents may encounter (Hmelo-Silver, 2004). The fact that scenarios reflect these characteristics is extremely important in terms of keeping students' their interest and motivaitonhigh in the learning process, which is one of the strengths of the PBL approach (Goodnough, 2011). Another important factor for effective PBL to is group work. Problematic group composition can negatively affect the learning experience (Alfonseca et al., 2006). In addition, teachers’ guidance for group work and within-group communication can also affect group work (Hmelo-Silver, 2004). LOC via group work may be more advantageous than PBL supported by various technologies, because many requirements for group work can be eliminated through breakout rooms that can be used in LOC. Though, due to the various findings in the literature, more research is needed to examine PBL in terms of its effects on learning achievement.

The results of the study revealed that the problem-solving skills of students in the experimental group significantly developed when compared to students in the control group. These results are consistent with the results of similar studies in the literature (Phungsuk et al., 2017; Hwang et al., 2012; Yu, She, & Lee, 2010; Pecore, 2013; Lee & Kim, 2005; Valentine et al., 2017; Kuo et al., 2012; Amalia, Surya, & heeputra, 2017). However, there are studies reporting that PBL activities do not significantly increase problem-solving skills. For instance, Cevik, Haslaman, and Celik (2015) have examined the effect of PBL activities on participants' problem-solving skills and have reported that they do not find any significant difference. Besides, in the literature, it is accepted that collaborative problem-solving practices are more beneficial than individual practices (Uribe et al., 2003) and that the PBL approach is an effective approach for the development of students' problem-solving skills (Phungsuk vd., 2017). As stated by Flynn (1989), the problem-solving process includes many cognitive processes from the identifying of the problem to the stage of proposing a solution. It may be one of the reasons why different research results are reported on this objective, because the problem to be experienced in any step of the problem-solving process has the potential to affect the whole process and research results. When the results of the study and studies in the literature are evaluated together, the general tendency on the issue is that PBL activities are in the direction of increasing problem-solving skills. In this context, it can be said that PBL implemented in real classroom environments and PBL in LOC have similar effects on students’ problem-solving skills. For this particular study, the results showed that PBL is a good alternative for the development of students' problem-solving skills in LOC, which has been frequently used since the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Dow (2006), the acquisition and development of problem-solving skills are one of the important goals of modern education. The importance of problem-solving skills in many fields from engineering to medicine is much well understood every day (Burkholder, Hwang, & Wieman, 2021). Accordingly, considering that the problem-solving skills are one of the 21st century skills for new millennium individuals (Kuo et al., 2012), the obtained results are clearly important.

Another critical finding of the study is that altough no significant difference was found between the experimental and control group students in terms of their communication skills there was a significant difference between the groups in terms of their interaction levels. Group work, being an important part of PBL activities, is thought to play a critical role in increasing interaction. Hill (2012) emphasizes the importance of teacher guidance for effective group work in PBL. Considering the PBL process as a whole, teachers should encourage students to collaborate by playing a facilitator role during group work (Ertmer & Simons, 2006; Hmelo-Silver, 2004). Therefore, students' active participation for the course in PBL (Phungsuk et al., 2017) and group work should be encouraged (L'Ecuyer et al., 2015). The generation Z, who can actively use social media and various communication platforms, need to be guided in order to conduct effective group work and to interact with each other in distance education (Chicca & Shellenbarger, 2018; Seemiller & Grace, 2017). Since the teacher role in PBL provides this guidance, interaction may have occurred at a sufficient level for PBL-based LOC. Considering the results of studies revealing that interaction in distance education does not occur at the desired level (Al-Musharraf & Alkhattabi, 2016; Rodrigues, Ramos, Silva, & Gomes, 2016; Zang et al., 2018), this study’ findings are remarkable. In this context, it can be said that PBL activities are an effective method to increase interaction in LOCs.

7. Limitations and future research
This study has a number of limitations. First, the course content of the study is limited to first aid training organized for university students. Future research must consider employing PBL for different objectives to determine its effects. Second, the study is limited to forty-five university students. Experimental studies should be conducted at different educational levels in order to increase the generalizability of the results obtained from the study. Another limitation is related to the variables used in this particular study. Students’ problem solving and communication skills, learning achievement, and interaction levels were investigated in this study. Future research may consider other variables including motivation, critical thinking skills, and perceived social and cognitive presence in order to determine the factors influencing the effectiveness of PBL. The next limitation is that breakout rooms were used for group work in this study. For future studies, different tools that can be used for group work could be included in the experimental process. Besides, this study is limited to the scales used for data collection and the learning achievement test. The last limitation is that the PBL process was considered as a whole in this study. Therefore, it is suggested to examine the each step of the PBL process to determine in which step students have difficulty in terms of communication, interaction, problem solving, and learning achievement.
