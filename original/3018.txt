This paper explores the ways in which higher education students search for information in fragile and conflict-affected contexts. Data for this study was drawn from verbal reports of nine participants engaged in retrospective think-aloud sessions to solve ten tasks each. The results of the thematic analysis revealed that the participants followed the pattern outlined in literature of connectivism and literacy frameworks. Namely, the participants proceeded with four interrelated steps: locating information, information use, remix and repurpose, and knowledge sharing. Some key themes were observed that differed from previous studies, including meta-search and the frequency of changing search keywords over time. Each difference deserves further consideration. Moreover, the results highlight extreme plagiarism among participants and their low-level competencies to innovatively evaluate and remix online content. This paper argues that critical and cyberliteracy are perhaps the nominated theoretical frameworks for developing information search mechanisms in oppressed societies. Implications for educational practices are discussed.

1. Introduction
More than 1.8 billion people live in fragile and conflict-affected contexts and the number is expected to grow to 2.3 billion by 2030 (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, 2018). The educational system is inherently political and can be perceived in such situations as both a victim or as a perpetrator (Al-Husseini & Elbeltagi, 2018; Pherali & Turner, 2018). In both cases, the motivation for teaching and learning is either affected negatively (Alenius et al., 2019; Al-Husseini & Elbeltagi, 2018), or positively (Pherali & Turner, 2018). Recognizing the fact that many countries touched by violence and systemic oppression are situated in Africa, Middle East and Latin America (OECD, 2018; World Bank, 2020), and that the existing body of research is skewed heavily toward the West (Young, 2014), leads us to the conclusion that little is known about whether western theories of teaching and learning are applicable to deprived societies.

Drawing upon this general gap, this paper attempts to track and interpret the information search behavior of students in a vulnerable society using literacy frameworks, studies concerning how information is produced, discovered, understood, and used (Mackey & Jacobson, 2011), and connectivism, a theory within the field of distance learning (AlDahdouh, 2018b, AlDahdouh, 2019, AlDahdouh, Osório, & Caires, 2015; Bozkurt et al., 2015, Siemens, 2005). The aim is to examine the degree to which those theories hold up in interpreting students' information search behavior in challenging contexts. The scope of the study is deliberately designed to be wide for two reasons. Firstly, previous research on information search behavior has developed into factions, each with a life of its own. These include online reading (Affouneh, Wimpenny, Ghodieh, Alsaud, & Obaid, 2018; Cho & Afflerbach, 2015; Coiro, 2011; Kiili, Bråten, Kullberg, & Leppänen, 2020), digital curation (Antonio, Martin, & Stagg, 2012; Antonio & Tuffley, 2015; Mihailidis, 2015; Song, Williams, Pruitt, & Schallert, 2017; Ungerer, 2016), copy-and-paste behavior or plagiarism (Akçapınar, 2015; Blau & Eshet-Alkalai, 2017; Chang, Chen, Huang, & Chou, 2015; Heckler & Forde, 2015; Kauffman & Young, 2015; Ma, McCabe, & Liu, 2013), and knowledge sharing (Chennamaneni, Teng, & Raja, 2012a; Teh, Yong, Chong, & Yew, 2011; Yilmaz, 2016). The holistic understanding of information search behavior is therefore dissected, which is why this current study adopts an integrative approach to behavior. Secondly, recent works, in countries suffering from structural violence and subjugation, show an increased interest in developing theoretical understanding of educational digitalization in accordance with their cultural specificities—based on the assumption that western-developed theories do not meet these requirements (Traxler, 2018; Traxler et al., 2019). Consequently, this paper questions this supposition.

Throughout this paper, the term information search behavior (ISB) refers to the way students search for, use, integrate, re-employ, create and share information when problem solving. Fragile and conflict-affected contexts (FCACs) are those countries or territories defined so by international organizations (World Bank, 2020). Taken together, the central research question guiding the current study is: To what extent ISB is significantly different in FCACs from those already known in western studies?

2. Background
2.1. Literacy frameworks
There are literally dozens of technology-related literacy frameworks, including information literacy (Association of College & Research Libraries, ACRL, 2015), digital literacy, digital competence (Spante, Hashemi, Lundin, & Algers, 2018), critical literacy (Downes, 2015; Gainer, 2013; Rutten, Rodman, Wright, & Soetaert, 2013), new literacies (Leu et al., 2013; Leu, Kinzer, Coiro, & Cammack, 2004; Leu, Kinzer, Coiro, Castek, & Henry, 2017), transliterarcy (Kathleen Dunaway, 2011), cyber literacy, media literacy, information fluency and visual literacy (see Mackey & Jacobson, 2011 for a review). Although the boundaries between these frames are not clear cut, a few frameworks are relevant for the current study.

Information literacy is traditionally defined as a set of skills. For instance, the Society of College, National and University Libraries in UK (1999) specified seven headline skills in higher education: (a) identifying one's knowledge gap, (b) recognizing the different ways in which the gap can be addressed, (c) setting search strategies, (d) locating information, (e) evaluating information obtained from different resources, (f) organizing information for sharing, and (g) building new knowledge upon existing information. However, with the advent of the Internet, researchers considered those skills insufficient and thus coined a set of terms such as digital literacy, critical literacy, media literacy, and cyberliteracy (Mackey & Jacobson, 2011; Spante et al., 2018). Martin (2006) defines digital literacy as

the awareness, attitude and ability of individuals to appropriately use digital tools and facilities to identify, access, manage, integrate, evaluate, analyse and synthesize digital resources, construct new knowledge, create media expressions, and communicate with others, in the context of specific life situations, in order to enable constructive social action; and to reflect upon this process. (p. 155).

Of note, the digital literacy definition covers the awareness and attitude as well as the emphasis on digital tools and resources. Critical literacy develops the idea further by underlining the importance of the circumferences, history, and environment (Rutten et al., 2013). It is not the text that matters, but the hidden motives of writing the text (who does it benefit or impair), the awareness of oneself throughout the reading experience (how one was and how one became), and the social context that produced the text. Students need to read the world, not the text (Gainer, 2013), and challenge the author and the reality (McNicol, 2016). Cyberliteracy extends critical literacy for online communication, to include issues such as recognizing online threats or hidden intentions (e.g. virus, malware, trojan and phishing software, advertisements, spam, fake news and deception), strengthening one's immune system against any attack, and maintaining other's privacy (Lazer et al., 2018; Mackey & Jacobson, 2011; Stiller & LeBlanc, 2006). In other words, students are asked to cleverly and ethically participate in learning networks.

A proliferation of literacy frameworks has given rise to a new concept which added the plural to literacy: new literacies (Leu et al., 2004; Leu et al., 2013; Leu et al., 2017). The crux of the matter is that “new technologies will always appear, regularly requiring additional new literacies” (Leu et al., 2013, p. 219). New literacies explore technology-specific areas such as online reading comprehension (Kiili, Laurinen, & Marttunen, 2009), multiple text use (Cho & Afflerbach, 2015; List & Alexander, 2019), and semiotics of multimodality in online media (Leu et al., 2017; Song et al., 2017). The new literacy movement has been criticized, however, as it creates “an unnecessary divide between information literacy and other literacy types” (Mackey & Jacobson, 2011, p. 70). Later works call for a unified framework (Mackey & Jacobson, 2011) and thus information literacy has been recently reframed as metaliterary (ACRL, 2015), and similarly, new literacies have introduced uppercase (New Literacies) as a unified framework (See Table 1 for a list of various literacy frameworks; Leu et al., 2017).

2.2. Connectivism
Most researchers investigating students' literacy have utilized learning theories such as constructivism or social constructivism to guide their procedures (e.g. Kiili et al., 2009; Kiili, Laurinen, Marttunen, & Leu, 2012). Yet, many researchers (Brooks, 2015; Kathleen Dunaway, 2011; Transue, 2013) have drawn upon the similarity between connectivism and literacy frameworks.

Connectivism continues to grow readily in the field of distance learning (Bozkurt et al., 2015), despite the debate whether connectivism is a learning theory (AlDahdouh, 2018a, AlDahdouh, 2018b; Downes, 2007, Downes, 2010, Siemens, 2005), knowledge theory (AlDahdouh, 2017, AlDahdouh, 2019, AlDahdouh, Osório, & Caires, 2015; Downes, 2008, Siemens, 2006), pedagogical practice (Kop & Hill, 2008), a phenomenon (Bell, 2011), or not a theory at all (Verhagen, 2006). Connectivism was used in this study for two reasons: (a) It provides insights on how one learns in a loose learning environment, with minimal interventions or even in the absence of a strategic learning plan (which best suits the FCACs), and (b) it sprung from distance learning, which parallels the current study settings.

To learn in a connectivist environment, students build their own personal learning network through a process which, to some extent, mimics the skills of literacy frameworks outlined above (Downes, 2009, Downes, 2010, Downes, 2016; Kop, Fournier, & Mak, 2011). According to Downes (2009) and Kop et al. (2011), a learner should engage in four stages: (a) aggregate and establish reliable connections to trusted and renewable resources, (b) remix information coming through connections to help see a new picture, (c) repurpose information by finding connections between similar messages, playing on the differences, and developing a critical view, (d) feed forward and share knowledge, as the aim is to create knowledge collectively. A distinguishing step in this model is the connections aggregation. It is not information that one should locate, rather, it is connections to renewable resources. Deep in connectivism mentality is the assumption that knowledge is accelerating so quickly that information has an expiration date, and is likely too close (AlDahdouh et al., 2015; Siemens, 2006). The aggregation stage has been further investigated by AlDahdouh (2018b) where he found that learners in the planning phase hold three perceptions that govern their choices of a resource: (a) self-efficacy, (b) eligibility of the resource, and (c) feasibility of the resource.

Empirical results across different research settings suggest that in order to survive in connectivist environments, learners need to possess digital literacy (AlDahdouh, 2019), self-regulation and self-motivation skills (AlDahdouh & Osório, 2016, Downes, 2020, Kop, 2011, Mackness and Bell, 2015). Furthermore, a recent study by AlDahdouh (2020) shows that emotions experienced in such environments are particularity negative (4.85 negative emotion to every positive emotion occurrence), although some negative emotions have positive impacts on learner performance. This adds the need to exert control over one's emotions.

2.3. Online reading
Many theorists argue that online reading does not equate to offline reading (D. Leu et al., 2004, e.g., 2013; Leu et al., 2017; List & Alexander, 2019; Rouet, Britt, & Durik, 2017). Beyond the fact that reading necessitates word decoding and comprehension, online reading involves selecting search keywords (Cho & Afflerbach, 2015), evaluating resource relevance (Rouet et al., 2018; Rouet, Ros, Goumi, Macedo-Rouet, & Dinet, 2011), checking resource authorities (Metzger, Flanagin, & Medders, 2010), investigating content credibility (Stanford History Education Group, Wineburg, McGrew, Breakstone, & Ortega, 2016), and making use of multiple texts (List & Alexander, 2019; Rouet et al., 2017). Moreover, the realm of networked information with hypertext technologies, multiple media and modalities (e.g., video, audio, interactive web, etc.) requires a different set of thinking skills which seem to overshoot those of reading offline (Afflerbach, Cho, & Kim, 2015; Leu et al., 2017). Empirically, this is supported in a study by Coiro (2011) where the results show that a former online reading comprehension score was able to explain a unique variance (15.4%) of the later online reading comprehension score, after rolling out the effect of the offline reading comprehension and prior knowledge. This means that offline reading skills and prior subject-matter knowledge were not enough to determine skills needed for online reading.

Empirical studies in non-FCACs (e.g., Kammerer, Bråten, Gerjets, & Strømsø, 2013; Kiili et al., 2012, Kiili et al., 2020; Kiili, Laurinen, & Marttunen, 2008; Ungerer, 2016; Wineburg et al., 2016) have consistently shown that students are lacking many online reading competencies, particularly evaluating resource relevance and checking resource authorities. For instance, instead of consciously evaluating the relevance of the links, successive studies by Rouet and colleagues show that students are increasingly counting on superficial cues such as links typed in upper case (Rouet et al., 2011), or the big number of citations of a reference (Rouet et al., 2018)—even if irrelevant to the search topic. Therefore,

Hypothesis 1

We do not expect students in FCACs to capture online reading competences.

2.4. Digital curation
Digital curation refers to the process of creating, synthesizing, analyzing, and maintaining a portable, persistent, current, remixable, integrable, sharable, commentable and searchable repository of useful digital resources for later use (Antonio et al., 2012; Jones, Dumais, & Bruce, 2005; Ungerer, 2016).

Traditionally, learners would keep and rearrange digital resources in a variety of ways, such as sending URLs to oneself/others, pasting URLs into structured documents/folders, printing out web info, writing sticky notes, pasting URLs to personal websites, and using some built-in features in web browsers such as bookmarks and history lists (Jones et al., 2005). While some of these methods may still be in use, a new generation of digital curation tools is readily available, including Pearltrees, Pinterest (Song et al., 2017), Flickr (Barton, 2012), and Scoop.it (Antonio & Tuffley, 2015). All of the studies reviewed here support the hypothesis that integrating digital curation usage in academic activities fosters knowledge acquisition (Barton, 2012), links academic life to real life, mixes informal and formal learning (Song et al., 2017), and promotes students' motivation (Antonio & Tuffley, 2015; Barton, 2012). In a study conducted by Antonio and Tuffley (2015), for example, a combination of goal setting lecturing and inducing first year students to curate content about the topic of their own choosing in relation to their future career, resulted in a promising increase in their engagement in the academic process. Accordingly,

Hypothesis 2

We expect students in FCACs to use digital curation tools.

2.5. Plagiarism
Interestingly, 83% of participants in the study by Mihailidis (2015) believe that curation is ethical. The debate about ethical practices has gained fresh prominence in online learning environments (AlDahdouh & Osório, 2016, Moorman and Pennell, 2017). For example, Moorman and Pennell asked, if saving images from Pinterest without citation is plagiarism.

The term plagiarism refers to the act of “copying others' words or ideas without attribution” (Heckler & Forde, 2015, p. 61). In regular academic settings, plagiarism is classified as an academically dishonest behavior, grouped with ghost-writing, cheat-sheets, unpermitted collaboration, copying homework, allowing others to copy one's work, and revealing information about tests others have not yet taken.

A considerable amount of literature has been published on plagiarism and anti-plagiarism worldwide including from the USA (Heckler & Forde, 2015; Kauffman & Young, 2015; McCabe, 2012; Stephens, Young, & Calabrese, 2007), China (Ma et al., 2013), UK (Selwyn, 2008; Trushell, Byrne, & Hassan, 2013), Turkey (Akçapınar, 2015), Hong Kong (Stapleton, 2012), Algeria (KHIATI, 2019), and Taiwan (Chang et al., 2015). Plagiarism is an epidemic, not only in terms of its geographical spread, but also in its intensity. In view of the aforementioned studies, plagiarism is a rampant practice among students. Studies show a range from 49.8% (Stephens et al., 2007) to 81.4% (Akçapınar, 2015) of students who admitted to plagiarizing. When teachers are asked the percentage rises to 82% (McCabe, 2012). Detecting plagiarism is now draining universities' human and financial resources (Selwyn, 2008).

A previous investigation shows that students often opt to use digital resources over paper-based resources, driven by the ease of copy-pasting information from digital resources (feasibility of the resources, AlDahdouh, 2018b). Such results may indicate that online learning environments exacerbate plagiarism, although this assumption is a logical fallacy. Logically, if two conditions contribute to produce an effect, negating one condition does not affect the probability of the second condition, though people tend to believe it increases its odds (Sloman, 2005). This fallacy has led to a proliferation of studies that compare face-to-face and online plagiarism (also known as digital plagiarism and cyber plagiarism, Blau & Eshet-Alkalai, 2017; Selwyn, 2008; Stephens et al., 2007; Trushell et al., 2013). The results of all these studies lead to one conclusion; plagiarism is a matter of personal beliefs; there is no difference found between conventional and digital plagiarism. Furthermore, deactivating the copy-paste function in online learning environments does not appear to contribute to reducing plagiarism (Akçapınar, 2015; Kauffman & Young, 2015; Kiili et al., 2020).

Most literacy frameworks encompass clear indications of ethical contribution (e.g., Gainer, 2013; Martin & Grudziecki, 2006; Spante et al., 2018). Curiously, in addition to playing down the importance of content, connectivism argues that students will continue to copy and paste regardless, and solicits students to confront controversial, unsolved and real-life problems (AlDahdouh, Osório, & Caires, 2015, Siemens, 2006). The evidence presented in this section suggests that,

Hypothesis 3

Students in FCACs will take part in plagiarism.

2.6. Knowledge sharing
By knowledge sharing (KS) we means not only the process of making one's own knowledge or resources available to others (Asterhan & Bouton, 2017), but also circulating and negotiating this knowledge (Al-Husseini & Elbeltagi, 2018; Ardichvili, 2008; Chao, Hwu, & Chang, 2011). KS is a complementary and preceding process of digital curation, where digital curation would never be feasible without people sharing their knowledge.

The existing literature on KS is extensive and is a major area of interest within the field of business (Ardichvili, 2008; Chennamaneni, Teng, & Raja, 2012b; Exline & Lobel, 1999; Hsu, Ju, Yen, & Chang, 2007). Although studying KS has recently gained momentum in the field of education (Al-Husseini & Elbeltagi, 2018; Chennamaneni et al., 2012a; Ma & Yuen, 2011; Teh et al., 2011; Yilmaz, 2016), it is still very much in its infancy.

Previous research into KS particularly focuses on its antecedents, with far too little attention being paid to its consequences. By way of illustration, KS is positively associated with adaptive consequences, such as innovation adoption (Al-Husseini & Elbeltagi, 2018), improvement in students' academic attainment (Chao et al., 2011), higher self-efficacy of sharing competences, enlargement of one's social network, attaining one's goals, and enhancing output quality (Lin, Lin, & Huang, 2008). In contrast, numerous published studies have highlighted a host of individual factors explaining why or why not people share their knowledge. Examples include perceived control—or a lack of control—of a sharing activity (e.g., the lack of language skills, Chennamaneni et al., 2012a; Rachel Zhou, Knoke, & Sakamoto, 2005), academic self-efficacy (Asterhan & Bouton, 2017; Hsu et al., 2007; Yilmaz, 2016), outcome expectations (Chennamaneni et al., 2012a; Hsu et al., 2007), the need to belong (Ma & Yuen, 2011; Yilmaz, 2016), personality traits (such as neuroticism, extraversion and openness, Teh et al., 2011), enjoyment of helping others (Chennamaneni et al., 2012a), mastery goal orientation (Asterhan & Bouton, 2017), and envy, whether being envious or being envied (Exline & Lobel, 1999; Nandedkar & Midha, 2014). In addition, studies reveal a set of contextual factors contributing to KS, including subjective norms (Chennamaneni et al., 2012a; Teh et al., 2011), trust of community (Hsu et al., 2007), collectivist value (Asterhan & Bouton, 2017), organizational climate (Chennamaneni et al., 2012a) and precaution of cultural differences (Rachel Zhou et al., 2005). Additional studies offer many other considerable reasons (e.g., channel richness, Kwok & Gao, 2005), but it is simply impossible to discuss them all here (for review, see Ardichvili, 2008; Chennamaneni et al., 2012b; Nandedkar & Midha, 2014).

An earlier criticism levelled at the information literacy framework was that it did not address the nature of participation and KS in the digital age. However, KS is now a cornerstone in most recent literacy frameworks (see Mackey & Jacobson, 2011; and Spante et al., 2018 for historical preview). In connectivism, KS is identified as the ultimate stage in the process of building personal learning networks (Downes, 2009; Kop et al., 2011). If nothing else,

Hypothesis 4

Students in FCACs are expected to comment on and recirculate others' works.

3. Methods
This study is exploratory in nature and was conducted remotely, where the researcher was located in different country than the participants. The approach to empirical research adopted for this study reflects a form of retrospective think-aloud protocols (RTA, also known as retrospective verbal protocol, prompted retrospective protocol and stimulated retrospective think-aloud; Ericsson, 2006; Ericsson & Simon, 1980; Kuusela & Paul, 2000; van den Haak, De Jong, & Jan Schellens, 2003; Van den Haak, de Jong, & Schellens, 2004). Studies comparing concurrent think-aloud protocol, unaided, and aided RTA have consistently shown that aided RTA and concurrent think-aloud provide comparable verbal reports in terms of quality and credibility (Beach & Willows, 2017; Nielsen, Clemmensen, & Yssing, 2002; Petrie & Precious, 2010; Peute, de Keizer, & Jaspers, 2015; Van den Haak et al., 2004). This method is particularly useful in eliciting rich data about ISB (for example, see the feedback on RTA in a study by Hofer, 2004). Three main phases characterize the procedures of the study (see Fig. 1). Participants were first invited and recruited by two academics working at Palestinian higher education institutes (HEIs). Upon arriving, each participant received a clear explanation of the experiment, was asked to sign an informed consent and to fill in a personal details form. The required software applications were then installed on the participant's devices accompanied by testing and training (see Table 1 in supplemental file for the list of software applications). In the second phase, each participant was individually given 10 tasks in succession. The participants were free to do whatever they wanted to solve the tasks at hand, but they had to record their activities thoroughly (e.g., video recordings of laptop/mobile screen while searching the Internet, voice recordings of conversations, screenshots of WhatsApp chats). After carrying out the tasks, the participants watched their documented activities and instructed to explain whatever was on their mind while performing those activities. In the last phase, participants received monetary gratification (US$26) upon completing the tasks of the experiment.

Data generated by participants in this current study contributed to studies reported elsewhere (AlDahdouh, 2018a, AlDahdouh, 2018b, AlDahdouh, 2019, AlDahdouh, 2020). However, we dedicated the current work to report on the results of ISB on the Internet, which are unique to this study.

3.1. Context
The latest list of FCACs issued by the World Bank (2020) encompasses 34 countries and territories, including Palestine from where the sample for this study was drawn. We believe Palestine was a good choice for various reasons. Firstly, Palestine is a country experiencing chronic aggression and long-standing conflict, classified as a FCAC in 1948 and has remained on the list ever since. Moreover, Gaza, the city in Palestine in which our sample resides, has been subject to several wars (Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, PCHR, 2018), long-lasting and harsh blockades (United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, 2017), and has experienced a severe electricity and fuel crisis (OCHA, 2015). To complicate matters, Gaza is an already overcrowded territory with a high fertility rate (4.5), and is highly impoverished, where 53% of people fall below the poverty line (Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, PCBS, 2019). Secondly, few studies in ISB have allowed the voices of Palestinian students to emerge while, in other studies, their voices were intentionally excluded (e.g., Asterhan & Bouton, 2017).

Despite the aforementioned hardships, Palestinians are achieving well in education, as is evident by the low rate of illiteracy (2.8%), defined as the inability to read and write among people aged 15 years and older (PCBS, 2019). Furthermore, there are 52 accredited HEIs in West Bank and Gaza, with 218,126 registered students (133,613 female) for the academic year 2018/2019 (Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, MHESR, 2019). The Palestinian education system has often been depicted as a victim of structural oppression (Traxler, 2018; Traxler et al., 2019). However, a thorough analysis of the context by Pherali and Turner (2018) reveals that this perception actually attracts more people to education in FCACs, simply because education is envisioned as a route to liberation.

3.2. Participants
Literature on online experiences gives evidence to support the purposeful selection of participants to those who are willing to generate rich data about the phenomenon (Limbu & Markauskaite, 2015; Sharpe & Benfield, 2012). Given the circumstances in FCACs and the difficulty in recruiting large samples for RTA study, only fifteen Palestinians singed the informed consent (see Table 2), of which nine completed the tasks of the experiment. Data generated from those nine participants is included in the analysis.

3.3. Tasks
Online reading studies (List & Alexander, 2019; Rouet et al., 2017) contend that there are several motives to read online. In academic settings, learners often read in response to others' requests (e.g., teacher, peers) and sometimes to satisfy their own needs and goals (e.g., entertainment, personal goals). Personal factors (e.g., prior knowledge, interest in the task) along with contextual factors (e.g., the authority of requester, audiences) determine the way learners proceed in reading online. Connectivism suggests that students be given controversial and unsolved tasks to motivate online reading (AlDahdouh et al., 2015). Taking the above into account, ten diverse tasks were created that were arranged based on their expected level of difficulty, from easy to difficult. The tasks are: (Q1) an information search, (Q2) the investigation of a person, (Q3) a question in their field of study, (Q4) a self-motivation question, (Q5) information validation, (Q6) a compound task, (Q7) writing an essay, (Q8) a design question, (Q9) a creativity question, and (Q10) a technical question (for task texts, see Table 2 in supplemental file).

3.4. Analysis
Literacy frameworks and connectivism guided the initial categorization process of ISB. Throughout the course of the experiment, the participants generated a large data corpus: 1364 files with a total storage size of 23 GB including 140 h of video recordings and 125 h of audio recordings. The data set of the current study encompasses only files pertaining to ISB on the Internet (183 files, 61 h of video recordings). Thematic analysis was conducted utilizing ATLAS.ti 7 (Braun & Clarke, 2006). The thematic analysis sought to provide a detailed account of ISB as outlined in connectivism and literacy frameworks (particularly the points of similarities and differences), rather than provide a rich thematic description of the entire data set. A prominence of a theme (whether it grasps important portion of ISB), not a prevalence of a theme was the analysis approach in this study (although we presented the theme prevalence in the results). The process of analysis involved reading the files and watching video recordings twice, extracting initial codes (although adopting a conservative open coding strategy, the list included 139 codes), searching for consistent themes (by allocating and re-allocating the similar codes, resulted in identifying 33 themes), grouping themes into nine categories, and fitting the categories into four general ISB phases known in the literature.

4. Results
Fig. 2 demonstrates how the participants flowed from one phase to another and shows the main categories under each phase. The themes under each category and their prevalence (M and SD of occurrence and the number of participants engaged) are summarized in Table 3.

4.1. Locating information
4.1.1. Formulating keywords
Table 3 shows that all participants in this study (N = 9) employed a variety of cognitive strategies to formulate their keywords for searching. Some examples include stretching the results (e.g., removing words), narrowing the results (e.g., adding words), using keyword synonyms, and changing the search language. Nowadays, formulating search keywords is no longer a mere cognitive process due to the advances in web browsers and search engines. The results indicate that the participants harnessed some cognitive heuristics (e.g., slowing down in typing a keyword to pick one from a search engine's popup list, writing generic keywords intentionally to pick one of the related links suggested by the search engine, and feeding search keywords found in previous searches). However, search customizations (e.g., restricting results to exact phrase, using the advanced search features, and limiting search results to specific category such as image, video, book and news) were underused.

Only one participant in the experiment, namely Amal, used meta-search (searching-about-searching) strategy throughout the experiment. When faced with the difficulty in Q09, she wrote the following keywords:

Amal: “How to search the Internet to find a text with missing parts”

4.1.2. Link choosing
As shown in Fig. 2, formulating keywords was usually followed by a link choosing phase. Closer inspection of the participants' responses reveals that they decided on which links to visit based on either logical reasons (eligibility evaluation) or their attitudes toward the contents of the links (personal propensity). Eligibility evaluation includes subthemes such as perceived usefulness, authority of the source, the newness, and the level of simplicity. Personal propensity comprises of preferring certain content over others (e.g., avoiding PDF files for HTML websites), satisfying curiosity, and following strange and attractive links. To fulfil their evaluations, the participants exercised a set of cognitive strategies (e.g., recall prior knowledge, detect out of scope content in links description, discover replications across different links, and keep links in mind, just in case they are needed later) and also made use of cognitive heuristics (e.g., taking heed of visited and unvisited links, paying attentions to lexical similarities between link descriptions and search keywords, and using links provided by trusted people). However, link choosing was not always a conscious act. Rather, the verbal reports disclosed that the participants sometimes chose links randomly (e.g., clicking the top link in the list without any further evaluation) and mistakenly clicking links.

Further qualitative analysis shows that some participants (Redaa and Amal) used more advanced skills in selecting links. Unlike other participants, they spent more time reading the links page thoroughly and treating it as a website of its own. They surfed the links page, (re)read it, and made use of the information presented to feed their searching keywords. For example, when Redaa and Amal noticed that their searching keywords had brought similar links, they did not just randomly open any link (as Neran did). Rather, they presumed their keywords were not formulated tightly enough. Therefore, they usually narrowed down their keywords without opening any link. The frequency of changing the keywords for Redaa and Amal started high and decreased over time as they refined more precise keywords.

In comparison, other participants changed keywords less frequently at the beginning of their search. They approached the links (sometimes in order) and spent a lot of time on their selected websites. As soon as they felt that their attempts to reach solutions were of little avail, they frequently began to change their keywords. The following excerpt from Neran, in Q03, clarifies this behavior:

Neran: I was going to open the link, but I said to myself: “No, I won't open it”.… it is all about the time. I mean, if I were at the beginning of the task, I might have opened the link.

4.1.3. Evaluating content
As the participants visited websites, they employed behavioral, cognitive, and metacognitive strategies to evaluate the content (see Table 3). Fast scanning of content, traversing the nested links, reviewing table of contents, checking interface validity (e.g., spelling, grammar and website design), and searching for practical examples were among the common behavioral strategies. Resourceful participants used somewhat sophisticated behavioral strategies to judge content by, for example, reviewing social cues (e.g., reading others' comments, and star ratings), and customizing searches (e.g., Redaa used image search to figure out that there were two persons with the same name in Q02). In contrast, cognitive strategies embodied recalling prior knowledge and experience, linking content across multiple documents/websites, detecting contradictions, and summarizing and memorizing content. Although less frequently, the participants did check website authors, publishers, and Universal Resource Locators (URLs). Metacognitive strategies were rarely observed (see Table 3). In this study, recognizing one's knowledge gaps and feeling the need to fill in those gaps, were the only metacognitive strategies found in the verbal reports. All the above-mentioned strategies were exploited to let participants give their final verdict on the content (e.g., useful, complex, detailed, concise, or not useful and unscientific). Based on this verdict, the participants either made use of information (the next phase) or left the websites.

4.2. Information use
The results, as shown in Fig. 2, indicate that a cycle of formulating keywords, choosing links, and evaluating content continued until the participants found useful content. In such cases, they either copy-pasted (plagiarized) the content or established a link to the source. Establishing a connection was infrequent and occurred only in classical forms (e.g., downloading files, keeping a reference in mind, and adding a bookmark) and ordinary forms (e.g., following Facebook page, installing mobile application, subscribing to a newsletter). More recent digital curation tools (such as those listed in Section 2.4) were not used, which indicates that the participants might have not been aware of the recent technologies in the field.

Plagiarism, in comparison, was the dominant step used among participants and took many forms. Mainly, the participants copied text or programming code from websites and pasted it to documents (word-processing document, code editor, paper), copied pictures (e.g., taking screenshots and photos, and downloading images), copied ideas (e.g., copying spoken words from video, paraphrasing), and forward messages on communication services (e.g., e-mail, Facebook, WhatsApp). In addition, the results of the current study corroborate the findings of much previous work (Akçapınar, 2015; Kauffman & Young, 2015; Kiili et al., 2020) in that deactivating the copy-paste feature does not contribute to limiting plagiarism, as it only induced the participants to think about how to plagiarize using other forms, thus moving from copying text to copying pictures or ideas. Below a brief scenario is presented on how plagiarism may compromise the learning process in ISB.

Amal, when asked in Q05 to investigate whether children under 5 years can read, found scientific evidence in support of this proposition. She plagiarized the content without fully believing it. The following conversation clarifies her point:

Amal: [I wrote, the child is] able.

Researcher: But you have just told me that you are not convinced that the child is able!

Amal: Yes.

Researcher: How it can be? [pause] Ok, Ok, did you comment [on your answer] that you are not convinced?

Amal: No.

This result should be of concern to teachers because it implies that student answers may not reflect their cognitive product. One suggestion is to enhance the formulation of the question so it explicitly asks students to make a comment on their answers (Coiro & Castek, 2011; Kiili, 2012; Leu et al., 2004). This procedure was followed in Q02 where the participants were asked to express their opinion about a given Palestinian activist after investigating his achievements. The results of this experiment showed, however, that plagiarism is not easily detected and controlled. The excerpt below illustrates this issue in Neran's own words.

Neran: There was a comment…. [brief pause] single bondI don't know for whom–but he [one of the commenters] wrote his opinion of Khaled Safi [the Palestinian activist] and you [the researcher] wanted me to write my opinion.

Neran: I will take this opinion, copy and paste it in the answer.

The previous excerpt exemplifies an extreme form of plagiarism among students. It may be impossible for teachers to track what students do at home, but using anti-plagiarism software to track such behavior might help (Akçapınar, 2015). However, even such solutions may fall short of expectations (McCabe, 2012; Stapleton, 2012). The following lengthy excerpt from Nawal's verbal report, in Q03, may help us to understand how students can manipulate the rules:

Nawal: I've already delivered [the answer in] one file containing 3 screenshots [mobile print-screens of some websites].

Researcher: So, are you satisfied with those screenshots?

Nawal: Yes, because if I am going to write by hand, I will write the same thing.

Researcher: Ok, let me ask you. If you were asked to deliver your answer to your professor at the university, would you deliver it as so?

Nawal: Certainly no, I will immediately write it again… And I can't also copy it as it is; I should paraphrase the sentences.

Researcher: You said that you will paraphrase the sentences. Can you tell me why?

Nawal: Because if they catch me … [pause with ‘hem’ sound]. First of all, and before they catch me, I don't like to be like others. Second, I would be like a thief. Third, if the professor found someone who copied-and-pasted the answer, he [the teacher] would give him [her] zero.

4.3. Remix and repurpose
Most participants created documents to collect what they found on the Internet. Their documents were, however, a collection of scattered sentences, images, links, and other items. In the remix phase, the participants purified their collection (e.g., reread and reevaluated items, deleted irrelevant and selected the best), formatted items (e.g., checked grammar and spelling, rearranged sentences, colored and aligned objects, and paraphrased sentences), and cognitively refined the text (e.g., detected contradictions, similarities, or missing information). There were a few instances across the data set showing that the participants engaged in writing text on their own (production).

The participants departed from the pattern outlined in the literature in call-to-action tasks (such as Q10, see supplementary file). Instead of storing and remixing information on a document, the participants imitated content found on the Internet on their devices (i.e., watching videos, reading tutorial, execute instructions, evaluate outcomes). Surprisingly, the imitation was done with no understanding, as the participants themselves acknowledged, while laughing and hoping that it would work out well for them (i.e., another form of cognitive offloading, Storm, Stone, & Benjamin, 2017). Reactions in case of failure varied between hypothesizing the causes, repeating the same steps, and randomly clicking on a website (a sign of confusion, AlDahdouh, 2020).

4.4. Knowledge sharing
It is apparent from Table 3 that only two participants (Weaam and Redaa) shared their learning outcomes (via e-mail and social media). In contrast, participants communicated with others to share and discuss the tasks, and the discussions followed a pattern of opening and ending (i.e., greeting and gratitude), requesting (e.g., ask question or ask for clarification and confirmation), receiving feedback (e.g., provide answer, give instruction, express opinion, demonstrate and modelling), and reflection (e.g., reread conversations, recall previous experience). In addition, a few disturbing inputs were spotted (e.g., mocking, disrespect others and swearword), which contaminated the conversations between the participants and others.

5. Discussion
5.1. Locating information
Formulating keywords is a poorly addressed and rarely investigated phase in the literature on ISB (e.g., Cho & Afflerbach, 2015; Kiili et al., 2008, Kiili et al., 2009). Furthermore, formulating keywords is commonly underestimated in online reading studies, that regard it as a low level behavioral skill (e.g., List & Alexander, 2019). We could not disagree more. As evident from the results of the current study, the failure to consider what to write in the search text box was one of the common reasons for participants to exclude the Internet altogether from their potential resources (see also previously reported results in AlDahdouh, 2019).

Part of the difficulty in formulating search keywords seems to be due to the participants' representations of the Internet. For most of the participants, the Internet is a big repository full of useful resources, where their only job is to formulate the right keywords to fetch those resources. While the Internet is indeed so, a more comprehensive view conceives the Internet as a means to develop one's searching skills. In this study, the term meta-search was coined to refer to searching-about-searching behavior. It is meta because it does not pertain directly to the subject matter. Rather, it resides in a higher level of searching which directs and manages how one should search. From this perspective, one does not need to teach learners digital competences (which are renewable, according to Leu et al., 2013); one needs to change their representations about the Internet.

Links evaluation is a cognitively demanding task as shown in Table 3. Apparently, learners resort to cognitive heuristics—also known as bandwagon heuristic (Sundar, 2008), endorsement heuristic (Metzger et al., 2010), social cue (Rouet et al., 2011), and recommended resources (AlDahdouh, 2018b)—to maximize information gain and to minimize cognitive consumption, especially under time pressure (Metzger et al., 2010; Rouet et al., 2017). These results coincide with those obtained by Metzger et al. (2010) who showed that individuals are increasingly relying on cognitive heuristics for credibility and evaluation online. Note that there is nothing wrong in using cognitive heuristics as long as they are used in harmony with cognitive strategies. Otherwise, cognitive heuristics become superficial cues (Rouet et al., 2011, Rouet et al., 2018), which are coded under unconscious acts in this study. Another important finding in choosing the links was that the difference in the frequency of changing search keywords over time between resourceful students and others. Further work is required to establish the viability of this discrepancy as a sign to distinguish those skillful students.

As expected (Hypothesis 1), the participants lacked the competencies to critically evaluate the relevance and the authority of the resources (Kammerer et al., 2013; Kiili et al., 2008, Kiili et al., 2012, Kiili et al., 2020; Ungerer, 2016; Wineburg et al., 2016). Some participants committed serious mistakes while interacting with online content (e.g., neglecting URL checking, Khaled W. entered his university username and password in another website). It is all too easy to wrongfully assume that the Internet is a safe environment. By any measure, the reported strategies by the participants were insufficient for evaluating online content (ACRL, 2015; McNicol, 2016; Spante et al., 2018) and did not even approach the deep analysis employed by adept Internet users. For instance, while our resourceful participants considered the top-rated items as valid resources (e.g., mobile application with five-star ratings), more adept users would consider it as a sign of deficiency, simply because nothing is perfect (Metzger et al., 2010).

5.2. Information use
Contrary to expectations (Hypothesis 2), none of the students used the digital curation tools. The participants counted mainly on the classical forms and the ordinary forms for content curation (see Jones et al., 2005 for comparable results). It seems possible that these results are due to the digital gap between developed and deprived countries. Given the positive effect of using curation tools on student performance (Antonio & Tuffley, 2015; Barton, 2012; Song et al., 2017), educators in FCACs may consider this finding in curriculum development.

Unlike previous studies (e.g., Akçapınar, 2015; Kammerer et al., 2013; Kauffman & Young, 2015; Kiili et al., 2020), this study did not impose any constraints on how the participants should act, especially about copy-pasting. The scenario presented in Section 4.2 clarifies that students are suffering from ethical dissonance (i.e. believing plagiarism is unethical and committing it anyway; Blau & Eshet-Alkalai, 2017; Stephens et al., 2007). The participants repeatedly justified their behavior by questioning the value of reinventing the wheel: if the answer was already there, why should they re-write (or paraphrase) them again? Nawal's report is a case in point. Although, the results were in line with our expectation that students in FCACs will take part in plagiarism (Hypothesis 3), it is somewhat surprising to witness such high level of plagiarism among participants (see the case of Neran). Overall, these cases present evidence in support of the connectivist proposal that students need to be confronted by unsolved and real life problems (see also previous work AlDahdouh, 2019, AlDahdouh, 2020).

5.3. Remix and repurpose
The findings in Section 4.3 are broadly consistent with connectivism (Downes, 2009, Downes, 2016; Kop et al., 2011), and literacy and online reading studies (List & Alexander, 2019; Martin & Grudziecki, 2006; Rouet et al., 2017; Spante et al., 2018) in that learners take part in generating cognitive product (most likely as written document) at the end of information searching sessions. These frameworks further contend that novelty and creativity will emerge by mixing information. This, however, does not appear to be the case in the current study. The mere aggregation with shallow processing and the lack of critical literacy did not encourage the participants to think beyond the obvious (Gainer, 2013; McNicol, 2016; Rutten et al., 2013; Stiller & LeBlanc, 2006).

Moreover, the findings of this study are contrary to previous studies, particularly regarding practical and call-to-action tasks (see Q10 in supplementary file). In this type of task, the participants did not generate a written document to reflect their cognitive product. Rather, they simply imitated content found on the Internet on their devices. To develop a full picture of ISB, additional studies will be needed to cover this type of tasks.

5.4. Knowledge sharing
The very low knowledge sharing is a rather unexpected result (Hypothesis 4). KS is the backbone of connectivism and literacy frameworks (Downes, 2009; Kop et al., 2011; Mackey & Jacobson, 2011; Spante et al., 2018). It was expected that the sample would participate in KS actively because it belongs to the new generation (Oblinger & Oblinger, 2005; Rosen, Whaling, Carrier, Cheever, & Rokkum, 2013) and to a collectivist community (Asterhan & Bouton, 2017; Traxler, 2018). While the possibility of individual inhibitors is not completely ruled out (e.g., a lack of control and being introvert, Asterhan & Bouton, 2017; Chennamaneni et al., 2012a; Rachel Zhou et al., 2005; Teh et al., 2011; Yilmaz, 2016), it is believed that contextual factors such as subjective norms (i.e., the nature of question-and-answer experimental context, Chennamaneni et al., 2012a; Teh et al., 2011) and distrust of public community (i.e., the fear of occupation and the doubt of online communication, Hsu et al., 2007) were behind the weak KS.

6. Conclusion
This study set out to examine whether ISB is significantly different in FCACs from those already known in western studies. The results of this investigation show that ISB of this sample overlaps with the expected behavior firmly outlined in connectivism and various literacy frameworks. Overall, this study strengthens the idea that ISB follows four interrelated phases: (a) locating information (i.e., formulating keywords, choosing links and evaluating content), (b) information use (i.e., plagiarism and establishing connections), (c) remix and repurpose (i.e., remixing and imitating content) and (d) knowledge sharing (i.e., sharing products and discussing questions). This finding will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in FCACs. Additionally, corroborated is the relevance of critical and cyber literacy as theoretical frameworks to mitigate the numerous flaws and defections that are witnessed in the ISB in FCACs (referring particularly to the extreme plagiarism and the lack of competencies to evaluate and remix online content ethically and innovatively). We argue that living under systemic oppression fairly justifies the low level of knowledge sharing in FCACs, but that does not exempt educators from the responsibility of finding ways to build a culture of trust among students. Although this study focuses on ISB in FCACs, the findings may well have a bearing on the broader understanding of ISB even in non-FCACs. In brief, data from the current study highlights the formulating of keywords as an important, yet under-researched and underestimated, stage in ISB. Further identified was meta-search (i.e., searching about searching) and the frequency of changing search keywords over time, as topics that may direct future works in the field of ISB. Being limited to nine participants, this study lacks the power to generalize its results to a wider scope. It is also unfortunate that the study did not analyze the outcomes of the students' search nor their initial digital competences. Despite its exploratory nature, this study offers some insight into ISB in FCACs.
