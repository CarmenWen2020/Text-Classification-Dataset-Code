Commercial social media are being increasingly adopted in formal learning settings even though they have not been conceived specifically for education. Whereas highly popular social services like Facebook and Twitter have been thoroughly investigated for their benefits for teaching and learning in higher education, other social media platforms which have been gaining considerable attention among youth have been largely overlooked in scholarly literature. The purpose of this study is to fill that vacuum by analyzing whether and how social media platforms like Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat and WhatsApp have become an integral component of teaching and learning in higher education. A total of 46 studies are analyzed in terms of what pedagogical affordances of these four platforms they identify (e.g., mixing information and learning resources, hybridization of expertise, widening of the context of learning) and the benefits for learning that the authors go on to investigate. Results show that although the use of WhatsApp is well documented in a plethora of studies, there is a dearth of research about Instagram, Pinterest and Snapchat. While more than half of the studies are carried out in the Middle East and Asian areas and investigate mostly benefits for second and foreign language learning, the overall geographical distribution of studies examining learning via social media reflects the preferences expressed for these services on the part of the general population. Moreover, it is found that the pedagogical affordances of social media are still only being partially implemented and that diverse social media exploit affordances to different degrees.

1. Introduction
The benefits that social media offer for learning in secondary and higher education have been extensively investigated for a number of years now, and significant research results have been achieved in different domains (Fox & Bird 2017; Greenhow & Askari 2017; Rodríguez-Hoyos, Salmón, & Fernández-Díaz 2015; Selwyn & Sterling 2016). Many authors consider social media as powerful drivers of change through which to accommodate learning needs into more social and open contexts, disrupting the traditional boundaries of teaching settings (Krutka & Carpenter 2016; McLoughlin & Lee 2010). Social media can also serve to reconnect the new generations of students to higher education institutions and support learning networks and social interaction in formal and informal learning (Junco 2014; Siemens & Weller 2011). With reference to e-learning, a meta-synthesis of studies pointed out that social media could facilitate deep learning and the creation of knowledge in e-learning at higher education institutions (Mnkandla & Minnaar 2018).

However, results of extensive surveys conducted in different countries demonstrate that, despite the positive attitude towards social media use for personal sharing and professional development, faculty staff are less prone to adopt them in teaching practices, due variously to cultural resistance, pedagogical issues and institutional constraints (Manca & Ranieri, 2016a; Manca & Ranieri, 2016c; Seaman & Tinti-Kane 2013; Willems, Adachi, Bussey, Doherty, & Huijser 2018). While resistance to instructional use of social media continues to be documented, a recent study on research trends in instructional design and technology journals show that social media studies, especially those focused on Facebook and Twitter, continue to attract scholarly interest (Bodily, Leary, & West, 2019). Not surprisingly, Facebook and Twitter have garnered the most attention in the literature reviews. Investigations of Facebook have tended to stress the benefits and challenges for general formal and informal learning (Chugh & Ruhi 2018; Manca & Ranieri, 2013; Manca & Ranieri, 2016b; Niu 2019) and for language pedagogy (Barrot 2018), whereas Twitter was found to encourage participation and collaborative learning transcending boundaries isolating the classroom setting (Gao, Luo, & Zhang 2012; Tang & Hew 2017b).

However, there remains a need to widen lines of research to include social media as yet little explored in educational science and that have progressively received considerable attention among youth. While the huge popularity of Facebook and Twitter has overshadowed the educational potential of other social media platforms, it is also important to investigate social media like Instagram and Snapchat since their rise has been documented as surpassing major platforms like Twitter and Facebook among younger users (Martin, Wang, Petty, Wang, & Wilkins 2018). In the United States, for instance, 46% of surveyed teenagers reported Snapchat as their favorite social platform and 32% identified Instagram as their favorite, while Twitter and Facebook collected only 6% and 5% respectively (Statista 2018a). When examining students' utilization preferences and their views on incorporating social media in higher education, for instance, Instagram is ranked higher than Facebook, Twitter and YouTube (Al-Bahrani, Patel, & Sheridan 2015). One particular study of multiple platforms (Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter) aimed at gaining a broad view of the social media landscape by exploring who is drawn to popular social media and why (Shane-Simpson, Manago, Gaggi, & Gillespie-Lynch 2018). This reported the popularity of Instagram among college students, women in particular, and identified a number of predictors for social media preference that include personal characteristics, such as gender and age, as well as the affordances of specific sites and privacy concerns.

It should be recognized that, as sociological studies point out, no single social media platform reflects the preferences expressed by the general population in regard to single platforms, especially given that age and socioeconomic status are factors driving engagement with many of these platforms (Blank & Lutz 2017). Nevertheless, the demographics they address are undoubtedly significant from an educational viewpoint. While research findings into global trends related to social media are available in the field of psychology (Zyoud, Sweileh, Awang, & Al-Jabi 2018), social media studies are underrepresented in the education literature, and a comprehensive overview of empirical research in this area is still lacking. This study seeks to fill this gap by providing a review of the literature specifically dedicated to the use of social media like Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat and WhatsApp in higher education. These four social media platforms were selected due to their huge popularity among the general population, specifically among youth (Statista, 2018a, Statista, 2018d), and because they offer diverse and distinct features for communication and sharing, thus reflecting diverse typology clusters. In this light, each of them may be considered representative of the service typology they belong to. The aim of this study is to present a preliminary evaluation of the platforms' potential for teaching and learning in formal education settings.

2. Theoretical background
Research has shown that social media have become significant in higher education for a number of reasons, such as their ubiquity and extensive use among a significant proportion of the population, their recent consolidated spread among those who were laggards, and, last by certainly not least, their widespread adoption among students and faculty (Rospigliosi 2019). Their pedagogical potential in teaching and learning has been theorized in many studies (Anderson 2009; Dede 2008; Duffy 2011; Greenhow 2011; Halverson 2011; Manca & Ranieri, 2013; Siemens & Weller 2011). Authors have emphasized social media potential in a number of areas: for supporting collaborative knowledge construction (Anderson 2009); contributing to hybridization of expertise and widening of learning settings (Manca & Ranieri, 2013); relational development and student support, especially in times of transition (Mazzoni & Iannone 2014); benefits for digital citizenship (Gleason & von Gillern 2018); and for blurring the boundaries between formal and informal learning (Greenhow & Lewin 2016). Other authors have stressed how social media can provide peer/alumni support and stimulate social and civic benefits (Greenhow 2011), not to mention how social networking serves the broad functions of socializing, sharing and sojourning in e-learning contexts (Anderson 2009). In this line, according to Duffy (2011), social media offer a set of affordances for the creation of online collaborative activities exceeding those provided by traditional Learning Management Systems (LMS), mostly because many students are already using them for socialization and communication purposes, and so would probably be willing and able to use them for learning as well.

Authors such as Dede 2008 have reported how social media practices implement social constructivist learning theories of knowledge as they are decentralized, accessible, and co-constructed learning environments involving a broad base of users. Also, the connectivist approach to learning has emphasized the cognitive and relational function of social media, as learners are encouraged to engage in peer-to-peer dialogue, to promote the sharing of resources, and to foster the development of communication skills (Siemens & Weller 2011). In this perspective, social media seem to blur the distinction between learning, social, and leisure spaces, thus providing a platform for mixing all sorts of activities together. However, to leverage the potential of social media such as Facebook, for instance, by widening the context for learning, information mixing, learning resource sharing, and hybridization of expertise, it is necessary for students and teachers to collaboratively review practices and arrive at a shared sense of responsibility that can facilitate the learning experience (Manca & Ranieri, 2013). As for the trade-off between formal and informal learning, Dabbagh and Kitsantas (2012) stress how social media have pedagogical affordances that can support and foster students' self-regulated learning through the creation of personal learning environments. Social media may encourage self-regulated learning processes such as goal setting and planning, and help to create personal or private learning spaces through self-generating content.

Along with potential and benefits, authors have also reported a number of challenges that emerge when social media use is combined with more established learning approaches in traditional learning settings. Halverson (2011), for instance, lists three major challenges when patterns of participatory culture enabled by social media are confronted with education needs. These include the need to protect students' privacy, the integration of goals established by learners in participatory culture patterns with those of schooling provided by instructors, as well as the construction of identity as a holistic framework versus institutional demands for learners to construct their identity as students. In addition, Siemens and Weller (2011) point out how educators should also be aware that ‘conflicts and tensions arise as the structure of networks clashes with the hierarchical structure of traditional education’ (p. 166). These considerations stress the need for awareness about the structures of power and tradition, which may be subverted, leading to unforeseen consequences. In this line of thought, Crook (2012) cautions about tensions related to the diversity between the closed boundaries of school classes or lecture halls and the openness of social media, while Merchant (2012) warns against positions that over-emphasize the popularity of social media among younger generations. Although many studies have reported young people's use of social media as a largely positive experience (Greenhow & Askari 2017; Manca & Ranieri, 2013; Manca & Ranieri, 2016b; Stewart 2015; Zachos, Paraskevopoulou-Kollia, & Anagnostopoulos 2018), the implications arising when the social media platforms that are popular among young learners are adopted for teaching and learning purposes still remain largely unexplored.

This brief overview of current thought on the pedagogical value of social media provides a theoretical background and reference point for examining the literature that inspired the author to undertake the literature review reported in this contribution; this literature is discussed in the following section.

3. Related literature
The educational research literature provides a variety of definitions of social media, positing them as being interchangeable with Web 2.0, social software, or the social web. The definition adopted in this study posits social media as Internet-based applications built on the technological foundations of Web 2.0, including social networking sites, blogs, wikis, multimedia platforms, virtual game worlds, and virtual social worlds (Kaplan & Haenlein 2010; Tess 2013). To present the various social services investigated in this study, the detailed classifications provided by Conole and Alevizou (2010) and Bower (2016) for grouping Web 2.0 technologies suitable for learning and teaching into type clusters was also used. In the following, the presentation of the investigated social media platforms is organized according to these type clusters: image-sharing services (Instagram); information organization services (Pinterest); photo messaging services (Snapchat); and instant messaging service (WhatsApp).

The first of the considered platforms, Instagram, is the most well-known image-sharing service, which enables users to asynchronously publish and share images; before posting, these can be edited with a native suite of digital filters. The service was launched in October 2010 and as of July 2018 was estimated to have one billion active users worldwide (Statista 2018f). In addition to its core image sharing functions, the platform now also offers video sharing and Instagram Stories, a function for time-limited content publishing. The country with the highest Instagram usership is the United States, with over 120 million monthly active users, followed by India (67 million), Brazil (63 million) and Indonesia (59 million) (Statista 2018b). The main educational use of Instagram is the sharing of study-related photos taken inside (or outside) the classroom for reference and analysis, and this can benefit from strong social integration with a variety of social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and Tumblr. The practice offers a number of educational affordances, like facilitating communication, supporting students' direct communication with instructors, improving the learning experience through posts about relevant articles or videos, and promoting collaboration among students inside and outside the classroom (Phillips 2013). Studies into Instagram for learning focus on aspects like its use in library contexts and in health and medicine (Boulos, Giustini, & Wheeler 2016; Messner, Medina-Messner, & Guidry 2016).

The second service, Pinterest, is a service for harvesting, organizing and sharing visual-based information on the web, and resharing it with updates or comments through republishing. The service, which has become the most popular in this typology, was launched in March 2010 and, as of July 2018, is reputed to have 200 million active users; the United States accounts for the largest national segment of Pinterest's user base, with 38.6% of desktop traffic (Statista 2018f). As a social platform geared towards the visual and the spatial, its pedagogical value mostly relies in organizing digitally abundant sources during the search process, in visualizing and spatializing findings and in incorporating images and other non-traditional sources into projects, thus offering unique capacities for revitalizing the commonplace book (Geraths & Kennerly 2015). Pinterest use is especially popular in marketing and advertising education (Cronin 2013), in nursing education (Mizelle & Beck 2018) and health information (Paige, Stellefson, Chaney, & Alber 2015). It has been also investigated in teachers' knowledge communities as an opportunity for sense-making and construction of instructional resources (Hu, Torphy, Opperman, Jansen, & Lo 2018).

The third service, Snapchat, is one of the more recent and popular social media platforms: its core demographic mostly consists of millennials. Snapchat is a mobile photo messaging and multimedia sharing app launched in September 2011 that enables users to send each other photos and videos. Users can also create Snapchat Stories combining visual and text elements, and these can be shared as a semi-public story or sent privately (Jeong & Lee 2017). As of July 2018, Snapchat counts 255 million active users, with 80 million daily active users in North America and 61 million in Europe; it is currently ranked as the most popular social media among teenagers and young adults in the United States (Statista 2018e). On Snapchat, text and image are integrated and work in concert making the service appealing for multimodal composition and literacy purposes (Bartels 2017).

The fourth and last social platform investigated in this study is WhatsApp, a cross-platform instant messaging service for mobile devices that was launched in January 2009. Since then, WhatsApp has become among the world's most popular mobile messaging apps, with 1.5 billion active users worldwide as of July 2018 (Statista 2018f). The app's reach is particularly strong in markets outside of the United States, where Facebook Messenger is ranked first with a 59.6% reach among mobile audiences (Statista 2018c). While Saudi Arabia and Malaysia have the largest share of their population to be the most active daily users (73% and 68%, respectively; Statista 2017a), in the USA only 22% of mobile users access the app on a daily basis (Statista 2017b). WhatsApp enables users to share text, image, video, voice messages and also video calls, and this versatility, alongside the app's pervasiveness, has attracted a range of studies in a number of educational research areas (Pimmer & Rambe 2018). Reported academic benefits include support for greater accessibility of learning materials, teacher availability, and the continuation of learning beyond class hours (Bouhnik & Deshen 2014). Further areas of interests are health education in resource constrained areas (Pimmer, Mhango, Mzumara, & Mbvundula 2017; Rambe & Mkono, 2019).

A common characteristic of all these platforms is that they are mostly used on mobile devices, Snapchat and WhatsApp being native smartphone applications. Mobile instant messaging (MIM) has been a topic of research investigation in the last ten years also in education (Bere & Rambe 2016). Recent studies reported educational benefits to supplement course content in dialogic activities with enhanced social presence (Tang & Hew 2017a), as well as inherent tensions of instant messaging for education (Pimmer & Rambe 2018). More generally, a number of studies have thoroughly investigated the impact on students' learning when mobile device use is integrated into teaching and learning, in and today mobile learning is a well-established and consolidated field (Sung, Chang, & Liu 2016). A branch of this field is mobile-assisted language learning (MALL), which in recent years has seen a shift from a content-delivery approach to supported collaboration, interaction and personalization for second and foreign language learning (Hwang & Fu, 2019; Kukulska-Hulme & Viberg 2018). In this light, mobile social media and instant messaging platforms have become emblematic for increasing levels of media convergence and for responsive pedagogy (Pimmer & Tulenko 2016; Ranieri et al., 2012).

Despite the plethora of studies reported above, the effects of social networking on language learning and the implications for instruction and curriculum development are still under explored. Except for a literature review on Facebook as a learning environment for language teaching and learning (Barrot 2018), there are no studies that have systematically analyzed other prominent social media for language learning in higher education. More generally, despite the number of research studies reported above that support the idea that these platforms are already situated in current practices in education, a systematic overview of these practices is still lacking.

This study aims at filling this vacuum by investigating how common actions like snapping, pinning, liking and texting have become an integral component of learning in higher education in diverse subject areas.

4. Rationale of the study
In this study a set of social media were selected for their popularity in different geographical areas and for their increasing pervasiveness, especially among youth and young adults. They were also chosen because they offer diverse and distinct features for communication and sharing, thus reflecting diverse typology clusters, and because current literature supports the idea that these platforms are already taking hold in educational practices in learning settings. All four social media platforms are analyzed as technology-enhanced learning environments either for formal or informal learning purposes in higher education and in terms of the pedagogical affordances they offer in pursuit of those purposes.

An operational definition of formal and informal learning that critically questions any clear-cut distinction between the two terms was adopted. As discussed in another study (Manca & Ranieri, 2016b), formality and informality need to be conceived as a continuum and as strictly interrelated. By contrast, actual learning experiences may be characterized in two distinct ways: by a prevalence of pre-structured learning content and pre-defined learning objectives, with mostly teacher-initiated or teacher‑lead learning activities (formal), or by ill-structured learning content and negotiated learning objectives (informal). In this sense, both approaches may occur within formal learning settings such as a classroom, a lecture hall or an online course delivered using a Learning Management System.

Use was also made of an analysis scheme for investigating social media pedagogical affordances which was originally conceptualized in previous research to investigate Facebook as a learning environment (Manca & Ranieri, 2013, Manca & Ranieri, 2016b). As this scheme proved to be operationally useful for analyzing Facebook studies, it was decided to test its viability for examining the pedagogical affordances of other social media. These affordances are thus defined as follows: a) mixing information and learning resources (the combination of instructional material with information and knowledge sources produced elsewhere and available through several channels); b) Hybridization of expertise (peripheral and emergent interactions occurring in the learning environment, including the participation of past students, experts and external professionals with different expertise); c) widening the context of learning (mixing different contexts of learning with social and personal life).

The aim of this study is to investigate to what extent academic studies analyze the educational value of Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat and WhatsApp, and in what areas of education. Specifically, the study pursues the following research aims: 1) to characterize the studies in terms of user population demographics (temporal and geographical distribution), disciplinary areas, research aims of the studies, usage typologies and research methods; 2) to examine the studies in terms of exploitation of social media pedagogical affordances and of different degrees of formality and informality.

5. Methodology
5.1. Materials and methods
The aim of this review is to provide a theoretically founded analysis of peer-reviewed papers that: 1) specifically investigate at least one of the four selected social media (Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat or WhatsApp) as a technology-enhanced learning environment; 2) were published in peer-reviewed English language academic journals; 3) focus on research and evaluation of learning or teaching activities; 4) reported empirical findings through qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-method designs, presented research questions and documentation of all procedures (Freeman et al. 2007).

The objective of the study is to analyze the use of the four social media platforms as digital learning environments for teaching and learning purposes. Therefore, studies that mainly focused on analysis of general attitudes or perceptions of college students with no prior educational use of social media, students' routines regarding their use of social media for socialization, or social media for interpersonal communication in academic life were excluded.

The methodological choice of selecting papers published exclusively in peer-reviewed journals implied that conference proceedings, unpublished manuscripts, research abstracts and dissertations, or conceptual studies were not analyzed for the review. Although conference proceedings and grey literature may offer documented research with supported findings, it was decided to exclude these sources because peer-reviewed academic journals generally grant better quality publications. It was also decided to limit the search to the Web of Science and Scopus databases as the broad search criteria adopted were likely to produce a very large number of results. Since the aim of the study was to investigate social media use in the various disciplinary areas, search terms like “education”, “learning” or “teaching” that might have excluded relevant results were not used. With this in mind, no further selection criteria like subject areas or categories were applied because disciplinary areas were an object of investigation.

The corpus of the study was collected through an extensive search using the keywords ‘Instagram’, ‘Pinterest’, ‘Snapchat’ and ‘WhatsApp’ applied separately. Distinct search criteria were used for each of the database sources queried. These were: (1) Web of Science (TOPIC, English articles, review); (2) Scopus (TITLE-ABS-KEY, English articles, review, articles in press). No specific time span was applied.

A first search was performed on the 22nd of March and a second was carried out on the 27th of August 2018 to identify any new articles published in the meantime. The searches yielded a number of articles distributed as follows: (1) Web of Science: 546 papers (Instagram); 127 papers (Pinterest); 82 papers (Snapchat); 300 papers (WhatsApp); (2) Scopus: 654 papers (Instagram); 148 papers (Pinterest); 105 papers (Snapchat); 361 papers (WhatsApp). The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) standards for systematic literature reviews (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altman, & The PRISMA Group 2009) guided the description of the eligibility criteria, information sources, data collection process, data items, and synthesis of results (Fig. 1). The final results comprised 46 papers: 3 for Instagram, 10 for Pinterest, 1 for Snapchat and 32 for WhatsApp.

5.2. Procedure and data analysis
The papers were analyzed according to a number of criteria that were adapted from (Manca & Ranieri, 2016b), while a further classification code – orientation of learning results – was derived from Hwang & Fu, 2019:

•
social media: Instagram; Pinterest; Snapchat; WhatsApp

•
author(s) and year of publication

•
geographical area

•
disciplinary area

•
aim of the study: evaluation of platform's efficacy when used as an instructional tool (focus on learning outcomes); exploration of social media as supportive and interactive learning environment (analysis of general learning benefits like social presence, collaboration activity, discussion, etc.); investigation of students' experience of use of social media as learning environments (evaluation of students' responses through self-reported measures)

•
research design and methods: quantitative; qualitative; mixed approach

•
usage: discussion and peer learning/assessment; content development; content delivery; resource sharing; support for self-organized learning (support of activities led by students although they were mainly teacher initiated)

•
orientation of results: positive; negative; ineffectual; mixed or conditional results

•
main findings

The studies were also analyzed to see whether they reported the leveraging of the pedagogical affordances that social media are held to offer: mixing information and learning resources; hybridization of expertise; and widening the context of learning (Manca & Ranieri, 2013; Manca & Ranieri, 2016b). In addition, they were classified according to the formal/informal character of the learning situation, defined as per the criteria mentioned in Section 3.

Finally, to classify studies dealing with second and foreign language learning, a partial categorization derived from Hwang & Fu, 2019 was used. The classification consists of the following coding scheme:

1. Language Acquisition

1.1 listening

1.2 speaking

1.3 reading

1.4 writing

1.5 vocabulary

1.6 grammar

1.7 pronunciation

1.8 integrated / whole language

2. Knowledge or Content Learning

2.1 subject-matter knowledge

2.2 language socialization /culture

2.3 other knowledge or content

3. Higher-Order Thinking or Competence

3.1 problem solving

3.2 critical thinking

3.3 creativity

3.4 communicative competence

3.5 other higher-order thinking

A preliminary test on a sample of 20 papers was conducted to verify whether the coding schemas were suitable for the corpus of papers. Since no change to the schema was required, the entire corpus of studies was analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively (Creswell 2014). The coding process was conducted individually by the author, who has developed a deep understanding of the coding scheme, which was employed in previous literature reviews (Manca & Ranieri, 2013; Manca & Ranieri, 2016b). In order to provide a level of reliability, in that qualitative data can be compared with coding criteria adopted by others, an iterative processes of data collection and analysis was carried out to lend rigor to the research and ensure that any bias (application of coding procedures) is consistent (Creswell 2014). Usually, codes developed by different researchers are cross- checked by comparing results that are independently derived. As an alternative to this process, here the studies were coded after the first search (22nd March) and then once again after the second search (27th August) to establish a measure of reliability. Different indices of reliability were calculated (Capozzoli, McSweeney, & Sinha 1999; Krippendorff, 2003, Krippendorff, 2004). These generated acceptable outcomes: percentage agreement was 0.98, while Krippendorff's α and Cohen's k were both 0.90.

6. Results
6.1. Study characteristics
Out of 46 studies considered in the review, more than half (N = 32; 69.6.0%) specifically investigated WhatsApp, ten (21.7%) were devoted to analyzing educational use of Pinterest, three (6.5%) of Instagram and only one (2.2%) of Snapchat. As reported in Table 1, temporal distribution shows a progressive increase in the number of published studies focusing on WhatsApp from 2013 to 2017, whereas for the other three services no particular increase or decrease in distribution was found.

In terms of geographical distribution (Fig. 2), more than one third (N = 17; 36.2%) of the studies was carried out in the Middle East, and to a lesser extent in Asia, Europe and North America (N = 8; 17.0% each), Africa (N = 4; 8.5%), South America and Oceania (N = 1; 1.3% each). Substantial differences among the four services were reported. While Instagram studies were concentrated in Asia (N = 3; 100.0%), Pinterest was investigated in North America (N = 8; 80.0%) and Europe (N = 2; 20.0%), and Snapchat study was carried out in South America (N = 1; 10.0%). WhatsApp was investigated mostly in Middle East (N = 17; 51.5.3%), and to a lesser degree in Europe (N = 6; 18.2%), Asia and Africa (N = 4; 12.1% each), with only one study (3.0%) for each country in South America and Oceania.

Fig. 2. Geographical distribution of the studies

As for disciplinary areas (Table 1), almost half of the studies (N = 20; 43.5%) regarded second and foreign language learning (SFLL), whereas the others are distributed across medical and nursing education (N = 8; 17.4%), social sciences (N = 7; 15.2%), ICT and educational technology (N = 4; 8.7%), teacher education (N = 2; 4.3%), and other subjects (N = 5; 10.9%).

With reference to the aims of studies, the majority sought to explore social media use as a supportive and interactive tool for learning (N = 20; 43.5%) or to evaluate their efficacy as instructional tools (N = 18; 39.1%). Only a minority investigate students' experience of use of social media as learning environments (N = 8; 17.4%). Detailed examination showed that Instagram, Pinterest and Snapchat were especially analyzed as complementary tools or in terms of evaluation of students' experience, whereas studies of WhatsApp centered on evaluation of its efficacy as an instructional tool.

Similar results emerged in terms of distribution of formal and informal use. Whereas the overall majority of the studies regarded use in formal learning (N = 25; 54.3%), for WhatsApp informal learning was the prevalent context (N = 20; 62.5%).

Analysis of how specific social media functions are used for learning reveals that the most common activities are discussion and peer learning/assessment (N = 25; 54.3%) and content development (N = 23; 50.0%), whereas delivery of content (N = 13; 28.3%) and resource sharing (N = 12; 26.1%) were less evident. However, notable differences were found among the four platforms: Instagram (N = 2; 66.7%), Pinterest (N = 9; 90.0%) and Snapchat (N = 1; 100.0%) were mostly used for students' content development, whereas a greater variation was observed in WhatsApp use, with a prevalence of discussion and peer learning (N = 21; 65.6%).

In terms of learning outcomes, the majority of studies reported positive results (N = 33; 71.7%) or mixed results (N = 11; 23.9%), whereas only one study returned negative results or no significant difference. When compared with the other platforms, WhatsApp studies reported the lowest rates of positive results (N = 21; 65.6%) and highest rates of mixed results (N = 9; 28.1%).

With reference to research design, the majority of studies adopted mixed method design (N = 22; 47.8%) or used quantitative methods (N = 19; 41.3%). The least commonly adopted of the three methods was the qualitative approach (N = 5; 10.9%). Among the studies that used quantitative methods, survey tools and pre-post test control group design or one group pre-post test were the main techniques. Mixed methods were mostly conducted with survey tools combined with interviews, focus group techniques, analysis of participation patterns and scoring rubrics. Qualitative studies mostly relied on interviews, analysis of patterns of participation and virtual ethnographic approaches.

Finally, as for social media affordances (Table 2), only 17 (37.0%) studies reported evidence of enriching learning resources with information and knowledge sources produced elsewhere. These studies were very unevenly spread across the four platforms, regarding all of the Pinterest studies but none of the Snapchat studies. The possibility of mixing learning, social and personal contexts was reported in a slightly higher percentage of studies (N = 17; 37.0%). Regarding the potential of widening the context of learning, Pinterest was the social media platform that was rated highest (N = 7; 70.0%) and WhatsApp the lowest (N = 8; 25.0%). The possibility of involving external professionals or other stakeholders was reported in only six (13.0%) studies, with a limited presence in Pinterest (N = 2; 20.0%) and WhatsApp (N = 4; 12.5%) studies.


Table 2. Social media affordances.

Instagram (N = 3)	Snapchat (N = 1)	Pinterest (N = 10)	WhatsApp (N = 32)	TOT (N = 46)
Mixing information and learning resources	0 (0.0%)	0 (0.0%)	10 (100.0%)	7 (21.9%)	17 (37.0%)
Hybridisation of expertise	0 (0.0%)	0 (0.0%)	2 (20.0%)	4 (12.5%)	6 (13.0%)
Widening context of learning	2 (66.7%)	0 (0.0%)	7 (70.0%)	8 (25.0%)	17 (37.0%)
6.2. Qualitative results
In the three studies that used Instagram, it was found that it encouraged expressions of thoughts and feelings creatively and with contextually-relevant content (Akhiar, Mydin, & Adi Kasuma 2017), it was effective in increasing willingness to communicate in the long term when compared to in-class activities (Chotipaktanasook & Reinders 2016), and in an out-of-the classroom the value of investigating forms of participation available to read-only participants and ‘lurkers’ was reported (Mikum, Suksakulchai, Chaisanit, & Murphy 2018).

Pinterest was used in a great variety of disciplinary areas, including social work education, architecture, accounting, fashion design, anthropology, psycholinguistics and nursing education. It proved to allow students to connect, interact, and share information also with professionals, governmental agencies, and nonprofit organizations (Baker & Hitchcock 2017) and to provide a source for problem-solving activities (Cimadomo 2014). Other studies reported increased student engagement and support for achieving learning objectives in a variety of subject matters (Holmes & Rasmussen 2018; Joyce 2017; Peterson-Ahmad, Stepp, & Somerville 2018; Shellenbarger & Robb 2013; Wagner 2014). In some cases, Pinterest provided hybridization of expertise and widening of the context of learning engaging external audience (Lapolla 2014; Pearce & Learmonth 2013; Song, Williams, Pruitt, & Shallert 2017).

The only study that investigated Snapchat use allowed students to review the content produced during the experiments and to answer the questions raised between two laboratory sessions (Lim, Ang, & Fung 2017).

While the majority of the reviewed studies of WhatsApp were related to second and foreign language learning (as reported below), some papers were focused on medical and nursing education to engage students in peer learning (Dambal et al. 2015; Dar et al. 2017; Khan, Siddiqui, Mohsin, Al-Momani, & Mirza 2017; Robinson et al. 2015), in clinical attachment (Raiman, Antbring, & Mahmood 2017), during their placements (Pimmer et al. 2018), and for integrating theory and clinical practice (Willemse 2015). Other studies investigated WhatsApp in ICT and educational technology classes for peer assessment (Güler 2017), for acquiring competences related to planning and organization (Pérez-Jorge, Barragán-Medero, Gutiérrez-Barroso, & Castro-León 2018), in pursuit of positive learning outcomes (So 2016), and for better time utilization and communication in distance education (Albers, Davison, & Johnson 2015; Hertzog & Swart 2018). However, one study pointed out student ambivalence towards the app due to competing after-hours family commitments (Rambe & Bere 2013) and another one reported minimal student engagement (Bridge et al. 2018).

6.3. Second and foreign language learning
Nearly half of the studies reviewed were related to English as second and foreign language learning (N = 20; 43.5%). Eighteen (90.0%) were conducted with WhatsApp and two (10.0%) with Instagram.

With reference to the categorization of learning outcomes, the majority (N = 15; 75.0%) fall into the category of language acquisition, while four (20.0%) studies investigated knowledge or content learning and five (25.0%) were dedicated to higher-order thinking or transversal competence development. With reference to language acquisition, as shown in Table 3, research on vocabulary ranked first with five (25.0%) studies (Alsaleem 2013; Bensalem 2018; Fageeh 2013; Shahbaz & Khan 2017; Taj, Ali, Sipra, & Ahmad 2017), whereas writing was in the next place with four (20.0%) studies (Akhiar et al. 2017; Alsaleem 2013; Andujar 2016; Awada 2016), as well as integrated/whole language (N = 4; 20.0%; Avci & Adiguzel 2017; Chotipaktanasook & Reinders 2016; Keogh 2017; Shariffuddin, Shaaidi, & Hashim 2017). The other ranked skill was speaking (Andújar-Vaca & Cruz-Martínez 2017; Han & Keskin 2016; Yavuz 2016) with three (15.02%) studies. No paper specifically investigated grammar and pronunciation, while one (5.0%) analyzed reading skills (Taj et al. 2017) and one (5.0%) was focused on listening skills (Yavuz 2016).

Regarding knowledge or content learning, it was found that one (5.0%) study investigated subject-matter knowledge acquisition in Dentistry education (Arani 2017). Two studies focused on language socialization/culture to promote dialect awareness towards different varieties of English in Turkey (Bozoglan & Gok 2017) and students' attitude towards teaching English as a Foreign Language (Alshammari, Parkes, & Adlington 2017). Metaphorical competence in language learning was another knowledge or content area investigated (Dehkordi & Hashemian 2017).

Finally, as for higher-order thinking and transversal competence as learning outcomes, three (15.0%) studies focused on communicative competence, two using WhatsApp (Almekhlafy & Alzubi 2017; Keogh 2017) and one Instagram (Chotipaktanasook & Reinders 2016). One study investigated critical thinking (Awada 2016) and one creativity (Avci & Adiguzel 2017).

7. Discussion
In this paper 46 empirical studies were identified and reviewed in order to provide a comprehensive picture of how social media like Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat and WhatsApp were used as technology-enhanced learning environments in higher education in diverse subject areas. The paper extends the results of previous literature reviews conducted on Facebook (Barrot 2018; Chugh & Ruhi 2018; Manca & Ranieri, 2013; Manca & Ranieri, 2016b; Niu 2019), Twitter (Gao et al. 2012; Tang & Hew 2017b) and mobile language learning (Hwang & Fu, 2019; Kukulska-Hulme & Viberg 2018; Pimmer & Rambe 2018; Tang & Hew 2017a), and provides a detailed picture of how the social media landscape and mobile collaborative learning are shaping teaching and learning process in higher education. The following two subsections discuss the two research aims of the study based on examination of the results concerning both social media use generally and specifically in second language learning, while the third one discusses exploitation of social media affordances.

7.1. Snapping, pinning, liking or texting: how and where?
The first research aim of this study was to characterize the articles in terms of user population demographics (temporal and geographical distribution), disciplinary areas, research focus, usage typologies, orientation of results and research methods. This is discussed below and in the subsequent subsection.

Temporal distribution of the reviewed studies confirms that research on social media continues to increase and investigation of their educational use still attracts scholarly interest (Bodily, Leary, & West, 2019). This seems especially true in the diverse geographical areas where a single social media platform is pervasive. The prevalence of WhatsApp studies over the other three services is probably linked to the worldwide popularity of this instant messaging service, which is ranked third after Facebook and YouTube among the most popular networks worldwide (Statista 2018d). The prevalence of studies in our review originating in the Middle East and Asia reflects the great popularity of WhatsApp among the general population, especially in rich and advanced non-English speaking countries like Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. As for the other three services, although Instagram is ranked sixth in terms of number of users worldwide (Statista 2018f) and despite rising academic interest in psychology studies (Shane-Simpson et al. 2018), Instagram seems to attract less interest in educational research; hence, further studies would be needed to validate the above-mentioned platform's educational potential. Pinterest, on the other hand, enjoys less overall popularity but has been attracting a higher number of studies, especially in the United States, which accounts for almost 40% of global traffic (Statista 2018f). The huge popularity of Pinterest in the United States is also leading to academic studies that examine the role played by this social service to support teachers' communities of practice based on knowledge building practices (Hu et al. 2018). The small number of studies on Snapchat can be explained by it being fundamentally a real-time visual service that involves greater reliance on graphics in communication (Jeong & Lee 2017), thus probably of limited potential relevance in disciplinary subject matters. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the future popularity and pedagogical potential for multimodal communication within ephemeral social media networks such as Snapchat for Generation Z (Rospigliosi 2019).

Analysis of disciplinary subject matters showed a strong presence of studies conducted in second language education, which confirms that mobile-assisted language learning continues to attract much scholarly interest (Hwang & Fu, 2019; Kukulska-Hulme & Viberg 2018). The wide usage of WhatsApp and Instagram in the teaching of English as a second language suggests that these services prove to be effective in learning environments where written and spoken communication is an intrinsic part of the learning process or where visual communication can provide effective support for the teaching process. Although this result is in line with previous studies reporting a propensity to use Facebook for second language learning (Barrot 2018), further investigation should be conducted with large samples of studies and with diverse populations (e.g., K-12 education). As for the other disciplines, the other results pertain to a diverse spectrum of disciplinary areas, with reference to a variety of social sciences, medical/nursing education, and educational technology and teacher education. These are also the disciplinary areas that have gained most interest in social media research in recent years (Fox & Bird 2017; Lantz-Andersson, Lundin, & Selwyn 2018), given that the related content and learning objectives involve much discussion and collaboration among learners. More generally, although these results seem to confirm that social media may be not suitable for teaching and learning in all disciplines, the scarcity of studies conducted on Instagram, Pinterest and Snapchat suggests that further investigation should be carried out to analyze which disciplines seem to be better suited to one particular platform or another.

When analyzing pedagogical potential, among the papers selected for review, more than half of the studies were found to be studies conducted into formal use, while the remaining studies were coded as based on informal use of social media. This means that the results of this review partially confirm the advocacy to value informal learning practices conducted with social media (Greenhow & Lewin 2016; Manca & Ranieri, 2016b) in so far as they implement purposes and processes of learning that are self-determined or not recognized as an intended outcome.

If we look at the corresponding usage typologies, our results seem to confirm that social media platforms tend to be used mostly to support discussion and peer learning/assessment, or to develop new content. These results may not be surprising, in so far as platforms such as WhatsApp mostly serve the purpose of facilitating interaction and exchange of information in several media formats, while Pinterest serves the need to create a “catalogue of ideas” and new ways to aggregate and organize content retrieved from the Web in original and new ways. However, the results also demonstrate that there is still some resistance to using social media to support self-organized learning (Dabbagh & Kitsantas 2012), or as a means through which to overcome the limits of traditional LMS use (Duffy 2011; Siemens & Weller 2011). On the one hand, some students and instructors seem to exploit social media to replace traditional digital learning environments and to implement implicit institutional, teacher and student pedagogies (Halverson 2011; Manca & Ranieri, 2013), a finding also reported in the discussion about poor overall exploitation of pedagogical affordances On the other hand, as highlighted in the prevalent use of Instagram to develop image-based content and to support self-learning, the results also show that each platform is considered as a specific socio-technical system with a particular range of user affordances and constraints (van Dijck 2013).

However, despite these indecisive results, the academic interest shown in the studies investigated probably attests to the notion that “the dust has [really] settled” (Selwyn & Sterling 2016) and that more mature research is progressively being made available. The majority of the investigated studies aimed at evaluating effectiveness of social media as instructional tools, or their exploitation to support complementary forms of teaching, rather than investigating students' reactions to their technology-enhanced learning experiences. Although the number of the studies that focused on evaluating students' response remains steady and comparable with results from a similar investigation conducted on Facebook (Manca & Ranieri, 2016b), we are witnessing an increasing diversification of social media uses and research aims, which is paralleled by a corresponding plethora of different research approaches.

In terms of research methods, it was found that studies conducted with quantitative and mixed methods mostly adopt (quasi) experimental design to test the efficacy of learning outcomes: survey tools and pre-post test control group design or one group pre-post tests were the main assessment techniques employed. On the contrary, a plethora of qualitative techniques like interviews, focus groups and analysis of participation patterns prevails in studies where measuring learning achievements calls for more dynamic assessment approaches. However, as reported in similar studies (Barrot 2018), the use of single design methods proved to be limited in unveiling other variables involved in the learning process, like implementation problems, the attitude of participants, and data collection bias. Future studies should seek to use multiple data sources or conduct in-depth probing during data collection, as well as adopting triangulation methods to ensure research quality.

Finally, as to learning outcomes, most of the studies report positive or mixed results. As reported above, diverse assessment methods were employed across the studies and pre-post test control group design or one group pre-post tests were frequently used to evaluate the efficacy of social media as an instructional tool or as a supportive and interactive tool for learning. In this line, the case of WhatsApp studies, which reported the lowest rates of positive results and highest rates of mixed results, comes as something of a surprise. This is because the service was mostly used to convey disciplinary content or to support discussion and peer learning/assessment, with limited active learning. The mixed results concern, for instance, appraising participation activity, which was evaluated with some self-reported activity, and learning outcomes measured through summative approaches in the same study. However, the diversity of results may also be due to theoretical underpinnings or to the assessment methodologies used in the studies, which resulted in a diverse global evaluation of the pedagogical practice. Finally, to explain the overall prevalence of positive results, we cannot ignore the presence of publication bias in scholarly literature, namely the tendency for journals and other outlets to publish studies that report positive results. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that studies reporting positive results are much more likely to be accepted for publication than those featuring inconclusive or negative outcomes (Tawfik, Rong, & Choi 2015). Further studies should also consider the quality of learning outcomes as an indicator of social media benefits in education.

7.2. Social media in second language learning
As for studies about language learning, it was found that English as foreign and second language was the target language. This confirms the results of Hwang & Fu, 2019, who conclude that whereas early studies were focused on fostering learners' individual language skills, in recent years addressing multiple language skills in authentic learning environments has become a prevailing trend. This seems especially true in some Asian and Middle East countries where the official language is English or where heavy investment is being made in improving English language proficiency to boost growing economies.

With regard to social media distribution, as already argued about general preferences for social media across the globe, the strong presence of studies conducted on WhatsApp in the Middle East and the Asia Pacific region reflects the massive popularity of this instant messaging service in these countries (Statista 2017b), along with massive mobile penetration (GSMA, 2017, GSMA, 2018). This result also confirms other studies conducted on mobile instant messaging (Tang & Hew 2017a) and on the use of Facebook for second language learning (Barrot 2018), which report a high concentration of studies carried out in Asia.

In term of typology of learning outcomes, unlike previous studies (Hwang & Fu, 2019), most of the studies in this review generally identified the effectiveness of mobile social media in terms of writing, vocabulary, speaking and integrated/whole language, while more evidence is needed to confirm their impacts on listening, grammar and pronunciation. In this perspective, mixed results about the unique communicative potential of WhatsApp (Rambe & Mkono, 2019) are found. On the one hand, the seamless integration of vocal communication, digital imagery and powerful internet searching capabilities still seems to be underused. On the other hand, limited screen size and the small size of virtual keyboards on portable devices like smartphones and tablets does not seem to prevent students from engaging in extended reading or writing.

Knowledge or content learning and development of higher-order thinking or transversal competences were little explored; specifically, there is a lack of literature investigating the development of problem-solving skills and little reference to critical thinking and creativity, as also reported in Hwang & Fu, 2019. Investigation of these aspects would contribute to mitigate the undermining of social media as incapable of supporting argumentation, discussion and knowledge construction due to their linear structure, as claimed by some authors (Kirschner 2015), despite promising results achieved in other studies (Tsovaltzi, Puhl, Judele, & Weinberger 2014).

Finally, although the reviewed studies provided evidence of the positive impact of social media on learners and language learning, a number of issue and challenges remain, such as distraction and technical difficulties. As pointed out in other studies (Barrot 2018; Tang & Hew 2017a), interference with learners' private lives seems to be a major critical issue. As suggested elsewhere (Tang & Hew 2017a), extra workload and disruption of the boundaries between student life and private life, especially for adult learners with families, are issues that demand caution and suggest the need to set certain ground rules prior to using MIM, like prescribed time windows for interaction, or explicitly elaborating on the purposes and advantages of learning activities prior to their implementation.

7.3. Social media affordances (under)exploited
The second research aim of this review is to examine the studies in terms of exploitation of social media pedagogical affordances and concerning different degrees of formality and informality.

The results show that the platforms are used in diverse teaching and learning situations, from strictly formal learning of curriculum subjects, including assessment procedures etc., to more informal contexts, where social media are used as tools complementing formal uses. This is in line with findings for Facebook use, where occurrences of formal and informal use within formal learning settings were largely equivalent (Manca & Ranieri, 2016b).

As for analysis of social media affordances, the findings are consistent with the two literature reviews concerning Facebook (Manca & Ranieri, 2013, Manca & Ranieri, 2016b), in that social media pedagogical affordances like mixing information and learning resources, hybridization of expertise, and widening the context of learning remain largely undervalued and underexploited. However, some noteworthy differences among the four investigated platforms emerge. Social media platforms like Pinterest seem to favor the inclusion of different types of learning material and to expand the traditional contexts of learning to accommodate external world resources. This is especially true of social media where users tend to establish connections with a wider network of contacts, unlike Facebook, which seems to orient users towards forms of bonding social capital and relationship maintenance (Ellison, Steinfield, & Lampe 2011; Ellison, Vitak, Gray, & Lampe 2014). Another explanation of the prevalence of social media affordances in Pinterest use is related to the disciplinary areas where the platform use was reported. Pinterest was used in a wide variety of social science fields, like social work education, architecture, accounting, fashion design, anthropology and nursing education. In this light, in those disciplinary areas where collaborative learning and involvement of external experts and resources strongly enhance the learning process, use of a single social media platform is prevalent.

However, in those studies where students' assessable work is made visible to other people, such as peers and external audiences, very little attention was paid to students' attitudes to the requirement of making their assessable work visible online to others. Further evidence would be necessary to explore possible conflicts between being part of an expanded cohesive learning community and the competitive and individual nature of university assessment in formal education (Waycott, Thompson, Sheard, & Clerehan 2017).

While some notable exceptions emerge concerning exploitation of the socio-technological affordances social media provide, these are counterbalanced by a general attitude of considering social platforms as closed spaces for delivering teaching and supporting learning. This seems especially true for services like WhatsApp, which are mostly used to reproduce the educational settings of the classroom or the lecture hall. In this light, while it is important to understand educators' and instructors' general attitude to social media and their pedagogical affordances, it is also vital to consider the socio-technical characteristics of different social platforms. While Facebook and WhatsApp are two-way services that require reciprocation, Pinterest and Instagram allow users to subscribe to their contacts' updates without automatic reciprocation. This is especially important to consider in educational settings where, for instance, sharing telephone numbers in WhatsApp raises privacy concerns. Indeed, each platform needs to be considered as a specific socio-technical system with a range of user affordances and constraints (van Dijck 2013) that demand proper consideration when designing learning experiences that employ social media.

8. Conclusion
This review was conducted with the aim of defining the contours of studies that have investigated use of Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat and WhatsApp as technology-enhanced learning environments in higher education. Hitherto, research on the educational use of these social media has been overshadowed by investigation of more high-profile platforms like Facebook and Twitter, about which a plethora of studies is available today; this is the first review that considers different cluster types of social media platforms. It is important to go beyond the more ‘iconic’ platforms like Facebook and Twitter and consider the educational benefits of other social media for higher education, not least because they are now surpassing the former in terms of use by young people. Most importantly, they offer a number of features that Facebook and Twitter provide at a less extent. For example, although Facebook and Twitter both offer features for image sharing, the predominantly image-based approach implemented by social media like Instagram and Pinterest may be beneficial for diverse subject matters in so far as they supply a real-time visual service that involves greater reliance on graphics in communication, or on spoken communication in the case of WhatsApp. Moreover, while social media platforms such as Facebook mostly orient users towards forms of bonding social capital and relationship maintenance with fewer opportunities to include external experts or learners, social media services like Pinterest and WhatsApp seem to support the formation of loose networks of contacts; these may well include externals experts and professionals active beyond the traditional boundaries of education settings. In general, the inclusion of different types of learning material and the expansion of the traditional contexts of learning to accommodate external world resources require educators and instructors to consider innovative approaches for teaching and learning that leverage the socio-technical features provided by the diverse platforms and services in a suitable manner.

Although current research has shown that the pedagogical affordances of social media remain only partially exploited, this study reports promising results in terms of subject matter learning outcomes, research methods, and the purposes of use in diverse educational settings. However, there is still a dearth of studies that contribute to provide a thorough picture of the state of the art in social media education worldwide. In this light, further social media need to be investigated to understand how their popularity for the general public in diverse geographical areas may be relevant and valuable in formal contexts of learning. Expansion of scholarly interest in these tools should be accompanied by more elaborated research design methods that can provide better conclusiveness and generalizability of results.

Further studies should also consider that certain social media and instant messaging services are precluded in some countries like China and Russia, which have their indigenous social media, such as WeChat in China (Luo & Yang 2018) and VKontakte in Russia and associated countries. Since culture affects both the design and use of social media platforms (van Dijck 2013), cultural patterns that are encoded in the design features of these platforms inevitably influence their educational usage. As suggested by some authors (Zhao, Shchekoturov, & Shchekoturova 2017), there is a need to consider platform differences while examining the impact of culture on usage difference in cross-country studies.

As for second language learning, more attention should be paid to second or foreign languages other than English, as well as to native languages. Greater understanding of the associated promotive factors, constraint conditions and applied strategies of mobile learning activities is also required (Hwang & Fu, 2019). Moreover, scholars should also consider the effects of using inexpensive, easy-to-use alternative technologies for supervision, engagement and general instructional support especially with low-income students and working professionals in countries struggling with high costs of network's provision (Rambe & Mkono, 2019).

While this study has provided some positive insights, a number of limitations need to be highlighted. First of all, the study sample generated for this review was selected from two major academic databases. Future studies might also include grey literature, education-specific databases like ERIC, general sources of academic work like Google Scholar, other prominent sources such as PubMed for specific biomedical and life science literature, as well as sources of non-English articles. Indeed, recent research shows that non-English languages are widely used in research and academic publishing, especially in the applied disciplines of sciences and social sciences (Liu 2016). This would be of particular importance for further elaboration on the geographical appropriation of social media for educational purposes in different learning settings.

In connection with this, a second limitation concerns the fact that the data analysis did not consider the publication venues of the studies. As reported elsewhere (Barrot 2018), it is important to consider the type of audience that studies have been reaching and how their regional or global relevance may be influential in expanding the field of research. If the aim is to further increase the awareness and interests of scholars in the use of social media in education, more publications in specialized and ranked journals should be considered for expanding the readership avenue. Lastly, future studies should also adopt analysis techniques based on meta-analysis and meta-synthesis to take stock of trends connected with social media in education.
