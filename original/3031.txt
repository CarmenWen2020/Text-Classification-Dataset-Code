This confirmatory factor analysis study examined the construct validity of the three presences of the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework (Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, 2000). The participants of this study were graduate students enrolled in fully online courses at a large Midwestern university. The results revealed that (a) the data fit very well with the thirteen item-three factor teaching presence model, (b) the data fit very well with the nine item-three factor social presence model, and (c) the data fit very well with the twelve item-four factor cognitive presence model. The results of this study empirically supported that each presence demonstrates a clear factor solution as proposed by the CoI framework. Theoretical and practical implications of the study results are discussed.

1. Introduction
Within the overall collaborative constructivist approach, the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework (Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, 2000) describes and measures the elements of collaborative online learning experiences (Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, 2010; Swan & Ice, 2010). According to this framework, the “online learning experience unfolds” through the interaction of the three key elements: social presence, teaching presence, and cognitive presence (Swan & Ice, 2010, p. 1). Since the development of the CoI, it has been the most widely used and cited framework as a theoretical context for research in both online and blended learning (Anderson, 2016; Befus, 2016; Swan & Ice, 2010). The CoI framework also provides both theoretical and methodological guidance for designing, teaching and learning in online learning environments (Swan, Garrison, & Richardson, 2009).

Arbaugh et al. (2008) from different institutions developed the self-reporting CoI instrument to operationalize the CoI framework and validated using multi-institutional data. Further studies examining the reliability and validity of the CoI instrument have also empirically supported the reliability of the CoI instrument and the construct validity of the CoI framework (Díaz, Swan, Ice, & Kupczynski, 2010; Garrison, Cleveland-Innes, & Fung, 2010; Kozan & Richardson, 2014). This indicates that teaching, social, and cognitive presence are the individual latent factors of the CoI framework. However, because of their multidimensional structure, previous research has highlighted the need for larger sample empirical studies concerning the construct validity of all three presences of the CoI (Arbaugh, 2007; Arbaugh & Hwang, 2006). For example, although previous research (e.g., Arbaugh & Hwang, 2006; Shea, Li, & Pickett, 2006) has attempted to validate the factor structure of teaching presence by using the Teaching Presence Scale (TPS) developed by Shea, Fredericksen, Pickett, and Pelz (2003), there is no agreement among studies about whether teaching presence has three or two dimensions or factors. The purpose of this study is to examine the latent factor structure of the three presences of the CoI framework to determine whether they demonstrate a clear factor solution corresponding to each construct proposed by the CoI framework as operationalized by the CoI instrument.

2. The Community of Inquiry Framework
The CoI framework is a process model that explains how deep and meaningful learning occurs within the community through the interaction of the three core elements. Social presence focuses on how participants socially interact in online learning environments and cognitive presence refers to higher-order thinking and critical thinking (Garrison et al., 2000). Teaching presence focuses on the design, facilitation, and direction of social and cognitive presence in order to achieve desired learning outcomes (Anderson, Rourke, Garrison, & Archer, 2001).

Early research on the CoI framework focused on assessing individual presences through content analysis (Anderson et al., 2001; Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, 2001; Rourke, Anderson, Garrison, & Archer, 2001). Later, Arbaugh and his colleagues from multiple institutions (2008) developed and validated the self-reporting CoI instrument with 34 items to measure the three presences in online learning environments. Arbaugh et al. (2008) deployed a principal component analysis (PCA) with 287 graduate students from multiple institutions in order to explore the factor structure of the CoI instrument. Their initial analysis yielded the possibility of an additional fourth factor with the eigenvalue > 1.0. However, this additional fourth factor caused a decrease in magnitude of the first and second factors' eigenvalues. Their results produced a clear three-factor solution aligned with the CoI framework. Over half (51.1%) of the total variance in this three-factor solution is attributed to the first factor, teaching presence. Their results also revealed that the instrument showed a high internal consistency for each presence with Cronbach's alpha values of 0.94 for teaching presence, 0.91 for social presence, and 0.95 for cognitive presence.

Díaz et al. (2010) used multiple rating measures to validate the CoI instrument. They differed from other validation studies by asking students to rate the importance of each CoI instrument item in addition to the degree to which teaching, social, and cognitive presence are manifest in their courses. They conducted PCA with oblimin rotation by specifying a three-factor solution. Aligning with the CoI framework, each item loaded on a corresponding factor. Cronbach's Alpha was 0.96 for teaching presence, 0.92 for social presence, and 0.95 for cognitive presence. However, they noted that when a number of factors were not specified, PCA resulted in additional fourth factor with an eigenvalue > 1. Similar to Arbaugh et al. (2008), they also concluded that teaching presence might measure more than one construct.

In a later factor analysis, Kozan and Richardson (2014) performed an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with promax rotation and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Different from previous studies, they utilized parallel analysis to determine the potential number of factors extracted in addition to scree plot and eigenvalue > 1. Their initial analysis also indicated a potential additional fourth factor. However, parallel analysis resulted in the three factors proposed by the CoI framework. Consequently, they ran their EFA analysis with three factors and results demonstrated the alignment of the three-factor solution with the CoI framework. Finally, their final CFA model confirmed the three-factor model aligning with the CoI framework (χ2 (514) = 1193.71; p < 0.0). Cronbach's Alpha was 0.96 for teaching presence, 0.91 for social presence, and 0.94 for cognitive presence.

In addition to the studies utilized the CoI instrument in English, previous research has also reported reliability and validity of the translated versions of the CoI instrument. For example, Öztürk (2012) conducted a CFA to examine the validity of the CoI instrument translated in Turkish by using a multi-institutional data (n = 140) from three universities. The final CFA model produced a clear three-factor solution aligning with the CoI instrument (χ2 (523) = 921.75; p < 0.01). Cronbach alpha value was 0.92 for teaching presence, 0.88 for social presence, 0.75 for cognitive presence, and 0.97 for the overall instrument. Likewise, Yu and Richardson (2015) performed both EFA and CFA to examine the reliability and validity of the CoI instrument translated in Korean. Their EFA results on 34 items produced a clear thee-factor model aligning with the CoI framework. However, since two items (i.e., “Getting to know other course participants gave me a sense of belonging” in SP and “The instructor clearly communicated important due dates/time frames for learning activities” in TP) cross loaded onto two factors, they were removed from the final analysis. The final EFA on the 32 items supported three factors model of the CoI instrument. They ran CFA with 32 items and the results produced a clear three-factor solution aligning with the CoI instrument (χ2 (461) = 1925.88, p < 0.001, IFI = 0.98, CFI = 0.98, GFI = 0.79, RMSEA = 0.084). Cronbach's Alpha was 0.95 for teaching presence, 0.91 social presence, 0.96 for cognitive presence, and 0.97 for overall instrument.

In all, previous validation studies have provided empirical support that all the items loaded significantly or converge on their corresponding factors aligning with the CoI framework as operationalized by the CoI instrument. Conversely, items showed small loadings onto the other factors, which are measured by different set of items. Respectively, such results provide empirical evidence of convergent and discriminant validity of the CoI instrument items as well as three-factor structure of the CoI framework (addressing a potential fourth factor).

Furthermore, some researchers have argued that the CoI framework does not reflect the full scope of possible components of online learning and have proposed additional presences (e.g., learning presence, emotional presence, autonomy presence, and agency presence). For example, Shea and Bidjerano (2010) proposed learning presence, suggesting that the current CoI framework is not enough to explain learner discourse in online learning environments. They first conceptualized learning presence as self-efficacy and effort regulation. Later, Shea and colleagues (e.g., Hayes, Uzuner-Smith, & Shea, 2015; Shea et al., 2014) continued to assess learning presence in online learning environments through content analysis and social network analysis. They found that the learning presence construct correlated with other presences and students' learning outcomes, such as course grades. As they have continued to work on learning presence, the definition and conceptualization has evolved. Shea et al. (2014) defined learning presence as “an iterative processes of forethought and planning, monitoring and adapting strategies for learning, and reflecting on results that successful students use to regulate their learning in online, interactive environments” (p. 10).

In a similar vein, Lam (2015) also asserted that the current CoI model does not reflect the learner discourse role in online learning environment and suggested autonomy presence, which is a social dimension of learning. According to Lam (2015):

Autonomy presence occurs when individual and social presences happen with two or more individuals. The sharing of ideas starts in autonomy presence and collaboration initiated from sharing continues in social presence. Autonomy presence initiates the discourse that leads to educational experience in social presence. It extends the discourse in the course, which is facilitated by the teachers (p. 55). He indicated that autonomy presence leads social and cognitive presence, and students replace the role of teacher in “deciding and sharing the content and initiating and directing the discourse” (Lam, 2015, p. 55). However, he further noted that autonomy presence can be complementary to learning presence and it needs to be further studied.

Anderson (2016) criticized whether the current CoI framework captures all the elements needed for successful online education and suggested agency presence, which captures the components mentioned by both Shea and Lam. Additionally, Cleveland-Innes and Campbell (2012) proposed emotional presence as a new construct in the CoI framework, defining it as “the outward expression of emotion, affect, and feeling by individuals and among individuals in a community of inquiry, as they relate to and interact with the learning technology, course content, students, and the instructor” (p. 283). In order to provide empirical evidence for emotional presence, they employed a PCA with 219 participants. Their results indicated, “the emotive experience does exist in combination with social presence, but it also clusters together as a unique presence” (p. 283). In a later study, Stenbom, Hrastinski, and Cleveland-Innes (2016) examined emotional presence in online one-to-one math coaching by using the data from a survey of online coaches and a transcript coding procedure from the online coaching service Math Coach. They found that emotional presence exists in online learning, and emotional presence exists as a separate element within the Relationship of Inquiry model, which is an adaptation of the CoI to one-to-one online coaching setting.

These additional presences are under investigation and have not been validated as part of the CoI framework (Kozan & Caskurlu, 2018). Therefore, in this study, the three-factor model proposed by Garrison et al. (2000) were used. Table 1 shows the proposed clustering of the dimensions for the three presences (Garrison et al., 2000). The following sections will describe the research related to the three presences and operationalization of each presence.

2.1. Social presence
Social presence refers to “the ability of participants in a community of inquiry to project themselves socially and emotionally, as ‘real’ people (i.e., their full personality), through the medium of communication being used” (Garrison et al., 2000, p. 94). Previous research on social presence has demonstrated that social presence is a significant determinant of students' satisfaction with the course (Arbaugh, 2005, Arbaugh, 2008; Gunawardena & Zittle, 1997; Richardson, Maeda, Lv & Caskurlu, 2017; Strong, Irby, Wynn, & McClure, 2012), students' satisfaction with the instructor (Richardson & Swan, 2003; Swan & Shih, 2005), and students' perceived learning in online courses (Richardson et al., 2017; Richardson & Swan, 2003).

Initially, Garrison et al. (2000) conceptualized social presence as emotional expression (now affective expression), open communication, and group cohesion. Later, Rourke et al. (2001) expanded these categories and identified 12 indicators of social presence within three categories based on Wiener and Mehrabian's (1968) work on immediacy to assess social presence in online discussions. Tu (2000) conceptualized social presence as social context, online communication, and interactivity. He also addressed privacy as a separate dimension or factor of social presence as it might impact the degree of perceived social presence. However, in Tu and McIsaac's (2002) factor analysis, privacy did not appear as a separate factor. Later, Sung and Mayer (2012) developed and validated the Online Social Presence Questionnaire (OSPQ) based on early measures of social presence, including Aragon (2003), Polhemus, Shih, and Swan (2001), Rourke et al. (2001), Tu and McIsaac (2002), and Yen and Tu (2011). Their operationalization included five factors: social respect, social sharing, open mind, social identity, and intimacy. Research on social presence has tried to address issues that arise because of its diverse definitions and conceptualizations (Kreijns, Kirschner, Jochems, & van Buuren, 2011; Lowenthal, 2010). For example, in a recent meta-analysis focusing on the magnitude of the relationship between social presence and student outcomes in fully online courses, Richardson et al. (2017) identified >10 different definitions of social presence and indicated that the commonality among these definitions is “is the ability to perceive others in an online environment” (p. 403). In that regard, Lowenthal (2010) claimed, “it is often hard to distinguish between whether someone is talking about social interaction, immediacy, intimacy, emotion, and/or connectedness when they talk about social presence” (p. 125). In this study it has been hypothesized that social presence dimensions include affective expression (“where learners share personal experiences of emotion, feelings, beliefs, and values”), open communication (“where learners build and sustain a sense of group commitment”), and group cohesion (“where learners interact around common intellectual activities and tasks”) (Swan et al., 2009, p. 52). Just as the conceptualization of social presence varies, there are a number of instruments measuring social presence in the literature (Richardson et al., 2017; Kreijns et al., 2011). However, as Richardson et al. (2017) found, the type of scale used to measure social presence is a significant predictor of the relationship between social presence and student outcomes, specifically student's satisfaction, and concluded that “psychometric properties of a scale used to measure a construct will also affect the correlation among constructs” (p. 414).

2.2. Cognitive presence
Cognitive presence is derived from critical-thinking literature and operationalized based on the cycle of Practical Inquiry Model (Garrison et al., 2001) and defined as “the extent to which the participants in any particular configuration of a community of inquiry are able to construct meaning through sustained communication” (Garrison et al., 2000, p. 89). Relevant research on the impact of cognitive presence on student outcomes in online environments suggests a significant relationship between cognitive presence and student's perceived learning (Akyol and Garrison, 2008, Akyol and Garrison, 2011; Arbaugh et al., 2008; Kyei-Blankson, Ntuli, & Donnelly, 2016) and satisfaction (Joo, Lim, & Kim, 2011; Roh, 2015).

According to the Practical Inquiry Model, learners move deliberately from understanding a problem or issue to exploration, integration and application (Garrison & Arbaugh, 2007). The four phases of cognitive presence include: (a) a triggering event where some issue or problem is identified for further inquiry, (b) students' exploration of the issue both individually and collaboratively through critical reflection and discourse, (c) integration, or constructing meaning from the ideas developed during exploration, and (d) resolution, where learners apply the newly gained knowledge to new educational contexts or workplace settings (Garrison et al., 2001). In addition, it is important to note that the Practical Inquiry Model is iterative and does not progress “sequentially or discretely” (Garrison & Anderson, 2003). Previous studies examining the distribution of cognitive presence in online environments indicated that students did not reach integration and resolution phases (e.g. Akyol & Garrison, 2008). In that regard, Garrison et al. (2010) asserted that most reasonable explanation could be “the design and expectations of the educational experiences” (p. 6). The authors also indicate that this could be a question about the validity of the cognitive presence as well.

2.3. Teaching presence
Teaching presence is defined as “the design, facilitation, and direction of cognitive and social process for the purpose of realizing personally meaningful and educationally worthwhile learning outcomes” (Anderson et al., 2001, p. 5). Teaching presence begins before the course starts as the course is planned and prepared, and it continues with the progression of the course implementation as the instructor facilitates the course (Anderson et al., 2001). Anderson et al. (2001) conceptualized teaching presence as:

•
design and organization which begins before the course starts and focuses on designing and planning the course,

•
facilitation discourse that occurs during the course and focuses on facilitating the course, maintaining learner's motivation, and encouraging learners for active learning, and

•
direct instruction that also happens during the course where instructor shares subject matter knowledge with students, and provides intellectual and scholarly leadership.

Research on teaching presence has demonstrated that it is a significant predictor of students' satisfaction (Arbaugh, 2008; Khalid & Quick, 2016; Kyei-Blankson et al., 2016) and perceived learning in online courses (Arbaugh, 2008; Shea, Li, Swan, & Pickett, 2005).

As there have been questions about a potential fourth factor for the CoI model, the teaching presence itself has encountered some questions about its conceptualization. It has been argued that if it has three factors (Arbaugh & Hwang, 2006; Miller, Hahs-Vaughn, & Zygouris-Coe, 2014) or two factors (Shea et al., 2005; Shea et al., 2006). For example, Shea et al. (2005) performed a factor analysis to explore the factor structure of teaching presence as measured by TPS. Their factor analysis results produced two factors namely instructional design and organization, and directed facilitation. They noted that direct instruction may not be a latent construct of teaching presence, but it is a discrete factor that contributed to facilitation. The authors concluded that teaching presence of the CoI model may need to be refined. Likewise, in a further study Shea et al. (2006) conducted a PCA to examine the factor structure of teaching presence by using the TPS. Their final model consisted of two factors: combination of facilitating discourse and direct instruction. Conversely, Arbaugh and Hwang (2006) used structural equation modeling to examine the construct validity of teaching presence by using the TPS with the sample of participants from MBA courses. The results supported a three-factor solution, including design and organization, facilitation discourse, and direct instruction as proposed by the CoI framework after removing three cross-loaded items from facilitation discourse and one non-significant loaded item from the direct instruction (GFI = 0.91; AGFI = 0.86; NFI = 0.98; χ2 (91) = 161.31; RMR = 0.04). As a summary, all these studies indicated the factor structure of teaching presence is still not clear and it might need to be refined.

2.4. Current study
Previous validation studies have provided empirical evidence for teaching, social, and cognitive presence as discriminant latent factors of the CoI framework (Arbaugh et al., 2008; Kozan & Richardson, 2014; Yu & Richardson, 2015; Öztürk, 2012). However, researchers addressed concerns regarding to conceptualization and operationalization of the individual presences because of their multidimensional structures (e. g. Arbaugh & Hwang, 2006; Garrison & Arbaugh, 2007; Kreijns, Van Acker, Vermeulen, & Van Buuren, 2014; Lowenthal, 2010; Shea et al., 2006). Early studies exploring the development and distribution of individual presences in online environments mainly used transcript analysis and utilized coding protocols. Addressing concerns about the diversity of coding protocols, Garrison and Arbaugh (2007) asked that “whether the elements have been well defined and if the categories are valid (representative of the element). Do the categories fully describe the elements (i.e., presences) of the community of inquiry?” (p. 160). Thus, more attention should be given into the factor structure of individual presences. A clear understanding of the multidimensional structure of individual presences is not only a theoretical issue, but also has practical implications as each presence directly or indirectly supports the development of other two presences, and each presence contributes the prediction of student outcomes (e.g., actual learning, perceived learning, satisfaction, etc.) in online (Arbaugh, 2013; Arbaugh & Hwang, 2006). Yet, to date, studies examining the construct validity of the individual presences in online learning environments have been limited to teaching presence as measured by the TPS developed by Shea et al. (2003), however, as previously, their findings were inconclusive (e.g., Arbaugh, 2007; Arbaugh & Hwang, 2006; Shea et al., 2006). Therefore, this confirmatory factor analysis study makes a significant contribution to the CoI literature by being the first study using the CoI instrument to examine the construct validity of each individual presence in online learning. Specifically, this study aims to examine the latent factor structure of teaching, social, and cognitive presences to determine whether they demonstrate a clear factor solution as proposed by the CoI framework. To achieve this, following research questions were posed:

1.
Does teaching presence demonstrate a three-factor solution aligning with the CoI framework?

2.
Does social presence demonstrate a three-factor solution aligning with the CoI framework?

3.
Does cognitive presence demonstrate a four-factor solution aligning with the CoI framework?

3. Methodology
3.1. Participants
The sample for this study came from 12 fully online graduate level courses offered in a Learning Design and Technology program at a large Midwestern University in the US. These courses are designed by fulltime faculty members but are taught by a number of limited term lecturers (LTLs) as well as fulltime faculty (Richardson et al., 2015). The common elements included in these courses were weekly overviews, interactive discussion forums with prompted questions, authentic learning activities that ask students to apply instructional design theories and principles to solve a real-world problem, and individual and collaborative group projects.

The data were collected from Fall 2011 to Summer 2015. The online questionnaire was accessed by 1017 people. However, 206 of the participants were enrolled in more than one online course. In order to control for the possibility of including these participants more than once, duplicate cases (n = 600) were identified based on the ID numbers provided by the participants. Only the initial response from each individual was included in the current study. Since 107 of the participants chose not to provide an ID number, they were removed from the sample. The final data set included 310 participants, of these (a) 155 (49.8%) were female, 59 (19%) male, and 97 (31.2%) did not indicate gender and (b) ages ranged from 23 to 65.

3.2. Measure
The CoI instrument (Arbaugh et al., 2008) was used for data collection. The survey instrument is v4 and downloaded from the CoI website (See Appendix A for the instrument). The instrument consists of 34 items including nine items measuring social presence (e.g., “Getting to know other course participants gave me a sense of belonging in the course”, “I felt comfortable interacting with other course participants”, “I felt comfortable disagreeing with other course participants while still maintaining a sense of trust”), 12 items for cognitive presence (e.g., “Problems posed increased my interest in course issues”, “Brainstorming and finding relevant information helped me resolve content related questions”, “Reflection on course content and discussions helped me understand fundamental concepts in this class”, “I can apply the knowledge created in this course to my work or other non-class related activities”), and 13 items for teaching presence (e.g., “The instructor provided clear instructions on how to participate in course learning activities”, “The instructor was helpful in identifying areas of agreement and disagreement on course topics that helped me to learn”, “The instructor helped to focus discussion on relevant issues in a way that helped me to learn”). Items ranged from 1 = “Strongly Disagree” to 5 = “Strongly Agree”.

3.3. Data screening
First, data were screened for missing data points. Since missing data points were <5%, missing values were replaced with the sample mean (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013). Second, data were checked data for univariate and multivariate outliers, and 40 cases were eliminated. Following, there was no multicollinearity or singularity issue among the items based on the 0.90 or above cut point (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013). Finally, data were checked for normality assumption. Unfortunately, the majority of items did not meet the normal distribution criteria. Different transformation methods (e.g., log transformation) were applied in order to check if the transformation could improve the distributional properties, but found that they did not. However, it is difficult to assume normality in rating scales (Clason & Dormody, 1994; Wu, 2007), and the sample size is large enough (>30) that the violation of the normality assumption is not expected to cause major problems (Pallant, 2007).

3.4. Data analysis
A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using LISREL 9.2 (Jöreskog & Sörbom, 2014) was conducted to test for significance of item loadings on each corresponding factor, and to evaluate fit of the data to the hypothesized factor model proposed by the CoI framework. A comparative fit index (CFI), an incremental fit index (IFI), normed fit index (NFI), and non-normed fit index (NNFI) above 0.95 and a goodness of fit index (GFI) above 0.90 are indicative of model fit (Hu & Bentler, 1999). Root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) value below 0.05 are considered excellent in terms of fit and below 0.10 are considered adequate (Browne & Cudeck, 1993). In addition to the model fit indices, convergent validity and discriminant validity were also used to test construct validity. Convergent validity is defined as” the degree to which measures are associated with corresponding construct”, and discriminant validity is defined as “the degree to which measures of constructs are distinct” (Deery, Iverson, & Erwin, 1999, p. 543). The convergent validity is tested based on factor loadings >0.5 (Fornell & Larcker, 1981). The discriminant validity was tested by calculating the chi-square difference between un-constrained model, which allowed the correlation between constructs to be free, and the constrained model, which the correlation between constructs to be constrained to 1.0 (Deery et al., 1999). This was performed for one pair of constructs at a time. When comparing models, a lower chi-square and expected-cross validation (ECVI) values indicate a better fit (Jöreskog & Sörbom, 1993).

4. Results
4.1. Descriptive statistics
To analyze the data, first, the internal reliability of each subscale was tested. Based on the current sample, internal reliability for overall instrument, teaching presence, social presence, and cognitive presence were 0.96, 0.96, 0.89, and 0.94 respectively indicating high internal consistency among the items. Table 2, Table 3, Table 4 show the means, standard deviations, and correlation coefficients of the categories of the all three presences. All correlation coefficients were significantly related to each other. Mean scores on the teaching presence items (see Table 2) ranged from M = 3.77 to M = 4.42, social presence items (see Table 3) ranged from M = 4.07 to M = 4.44, and cognitive presence items (see Table 3) ranged from M = 4.03 to M = 4.40.

4.2. Examining teaching presence
An initial teaching presence model was created with the three factors proposed by the CoI framework. However, based on the model fit values stated in the data analysis section, the initial model did not show an adequate fit for the data (χ2 (62) = 298.46, p < 0.001) due to high RMSEA value of 0.12 and low GFI value of 0.86. An examination of modification indices from the LISREL confirmatory factor model output revealed a need for estimation of error covariance between:

•
TP5 “The instructor was helpful in identifying areas of agreement and disagreement on course topics that helped me to learn” and TP6 “The instructor was helpful in guiding the class towards understanding course topics in a way that helped me clarify my thinking”,

•
TP12 “The instructor provided feedback that helped me understand my strengths and weaknesses” and TP13 “The instructor provided feedback in a timely fashion”.

Accordingly, a final model as represented in the Fig. 1 was tested in order to reach an acceptable RMSEA value and increase GIF value by estimating the error covariance between TP5 and TP6, and TP12 and TP13. After estimating these error covariances, the data fit the final model very well, (χ2 (60) = 127.30, p < 0.001) with an acceptable RMSEA value of 0.06. The obtained t values ranged from 12.07 to 19.51, indicating that all the items are significant at <0.001 (>3.29, Hatcher, 1994). Table 5 shows the other fit indices used to evaluate the model fit.

The factor loadings from the CFA provided evidence for convergent validity as all the items loaded sufficiently high, >0.50 (Fornell & Larcker, 1981) on their corresponding factors. On the other hand, the standardized covariance value between facilitation and direct instruction was >1.0. This might cause violation of the discriminant validity. The discriminant validity was tested by calculating the chi-square difference between the un-constrained model (See Fig. 3) and the constrained models.

Given the significant chi-square change (See Table 6), Model 1 is significantly better than Model 3 (Δ χ2 (1) = 51.17, p < 0.001) and Model 4 (Δ χ2 (1) = 202.24, p < 0.001) with a lower chi-square value. This indicated that design and organization is distinct from both direct instruction and facilitation. On the other hand, chi-square difference between Model 1 and Model 2 was not significant indicating that direct instruction and facilitation may not be distinct from each other.

Another model was tested with two factors, including design and organization, and combination of direct instruction and facilitation. Examination of the fit indices showed that the data fit the two-factor model very well (χ2 (64) = 165.13, p < 0.001) with an acceptable RMSEA value of 0.08.

The chi-square difference test was performed to compare three- and two-factor teaching presence models. Change in, chi-square between the models suggested that three-factor model is significantly better than the two-factor model with a lower chi-square value (Δ χ2 (4) = 37.83, p < 0.001). Furthermore, ECVI value was lower and other fit indices were greater for the three-factor model than two-factor model. Based on these results, three-factor teaching presence model (See Fig. 3) allowing two error covariances between TP5 and TP6, and TP12 and TP13 is considered the better model. The first factor, design and organization, had four items (TP1, TP2, TP3, and TP4) with loadings between 0.66 and 0.91. The second factor, facilitating discourse, had six items (TP5, TP6, TP7, TP8, TP9 and TP10) with loadings between 0.78 and 0.91. The third factor, direct instruction, had three items (TP11, TP12, and TP13) with loadings between 0.68 and 0.91. The final teaching presence model aligned with the CoI framework.

4.3. Examining social presence
An initial social presence model was tested with the three factors suggested by the CoI framework. However, based on the model fit values stated above, the initial CFA model did not show an adequate fit for the data (χ2 (24) = 265.46, p < 0.001) due to the high RMSEA value of 0.19, and low CFI of 89; IFI of 0.89, and GFI of 0.84. Modification indices recommended estimating error covariance between:

•
SP14 “Getting to know other course participants gave me a sense of belonging in the course” and SP15 “I was able to form distinct impressions of some course participants”, and

•
SP16 “Online or web-based communication is an excellent medium for social interaction” and SP21 “I felt that my point of view was acknowledged by other course participants”.

Accordingly, a final model was created in order to reach an acceptable RMSEA value and increasing CFI, IFI, and GFI values by estimating error covariance between SP14 and SP15, and SP16 and SP21. After estimating these error covariances, the data fit the final model very well, χ2 (22) = 56.49, p < 0.001 with an adequate RMSEA value of 0.08 (See Table 5 for the other fit indices used to evaluate model fit). The obtained t values ranged from 8.81 to 20.11, which indicates that all items are significant at <0.001 (>3.29; Hatcher, 1994).

The factor loadings from the CFA provide evidence for convergent validity as all items loaded sufficiently high >0.50 (Fornell & Larcker, 1981) to the corresponding factors. However, as seen on the Fig. 2, the high standardized covariance value of 1.01 indicates that affective expression and group cohesion may not be distinct from each other. The discriminant validity was tested by calculating the chi-square difference between the un-constrained model and the constrained models. Change in chi-square between the constrained and non-constrained models were significant for the Model 2 (Δ χ2 (1) = 28.06, p < 0.001) and 4 (Δ χ2 (1) = 49, p < 0.001), however, it was not significant for the Model 3. The results of the difference tests confirmed that open communication is distinct from both affective expression and group cohesion. However, the results indicated that group cohesion and affective expression might not be distinct from each other.

Following, another model was tested with two factors including open communication, and combination of affective expression and group cohesion. This model did not show a good fit (χ2 (26) = 137.49, p < 0.001) due to high RMSEA value of 0.15. Model indices suggested estimation of error covariance between SP14 and SP15, and SP16 and SP21. Accordingly, a final model was created in order to reach an acceptable RMSEA value by estimating two error covariances. After estimating these error covariances, the data fit the final model very well, χ2 (24) = 59.63, p < 0.001 with an acceptable RMSEA value of 0.07.

Chi-square difference test was employed to compare three- and two-factor social presence model. However, change in the chi-square was not significant (Δ χ2 (2) = 3.14, p > 0.05). When other model fitness indices were compared, ECVI value was equal for both models but three-factor model revealed higher GFI value than two-factor model. Since combining affective expression and group cohesion did not contribute a significant improvement on the hypothesized three-factor model, three-factor model allowing two error covariances between SP14 and SP 15, and SP16 and SP21 is considered as a better model. The first factor, affective expression, had three items (SP14, SP15, and SP16) with loadings between 0.53 and 0.72. The second factor, open communication, had three items (SP17, SP18, and SP19) with loadings between 0.86 and 0.94. Finally, the third factor, group cohesion, had three items (SP20, SP21, SP22) with loadings between 0.69 and 0.76.

Furthermore, the three-factor model also suggested a need for estimating the cross loading for SP20 “I felt comfortable disagreeing with other course participants while still maintaining a sense of trust” and SP22 “Online discussions help me to develop a sense of collaboration” on both affective expression and open communication factors. After estimating these correlations, the model showed a better fit but it was not significantly improved from the previous model. Consequently, the final model consisted of three factors with nine items, including the two error covariances, and aligned with the CoI framework.

4.4. Examining cognitive presence
An initial cognitive presence model was created with four factors as proposed by the CoI framework. However, the initial CFA model did not provide an adequate fit for the data (χ2 (48) = 201.91, p < 0.001) due to high RMSEA value of 0.11 and low CFI value of 0.89. Modification indices suggested estimating error covariance between:

•
CP28 “Online discussions were valuable in helping me appreciate different perspectives” and CP29 “Combining new information helped me answer questions raised in course activities”,

•
CP 32 “I can describe ways to test and apply the knowledge created in this course” and CP34 “I can apply the knowledge created in this course to my work or other non-class related activities”, and

•
CP33 “I have developed solutions to course problems that can be applied in practice” and CP34 “I can apply the knowledge created in this course to my work or other non-class related activities”.

The final model for the cognitive presence was created according to modification indices in order to increase all CFI, IFI, and GFI indices as well as to reach an acceptable RMSEA value by estimating the three error covariances. After releasing the error covariances, the data fit the final model very well (χ2 (45) = 119.84, p < 0.001) with and acceptable RMSEA value of 0.08. Table 5 shows the other fit indices used to evaluate model fit. The obtained t values ranged from 9.11 to 18.28 which indicates that all items are significant at <0.001 (>3.29, Hatcher, 1994).

Furthermore, the factor loadings from the CFA provide evidence for convergent validity as all items loaded >0.50 (Fornell & Larcker, 1981) on their corresponding factors. The discriminant validity was tested by calculating the chi-square difference between the un-constrained model and each constrained models. As shown in the Table 6, change in chi-square between the constrained and non-constrained models were significant for all of the models at p < 0.001. The results of the difference test confirmed the discriminant validity of the cognitive presence. The final cognitive presence model is aligned with the CoI framework. The first factor, triggering event, had three items (CP23, CP24, and CP25) with loadings between 0.81 and 0.89. The second factor, exploration, had three items (CP26, CP27, and CP28) with loadings from 0.54 and 0.76. The third factor, integration, had three items (CP29, CP30, and CP31) with loadings between 0.73 and 0.85. Finally, the fourth factor, resolution, had three items (CP32, CP33, and CP34) with loadings between 0.80 and 0.87.

5. Discussion
This study seeks to examine the construct validity of the three presences of the CoI framework using the CoI instrument. The results of this study empirically supported the conceptualization of all three presences as initially proposed by the CoI framework (Garrison et al., 2000) as well as the reliability and validity of the CoI instrument.

5.1. Does teaching presence demonstrate a four-factor solution aligning with the CoI framework?
The analysis of the teaching presence demonstrated a clear three-factor solution as proposed by the CoI framework, allowing two error covariances. Since these error covariances are between the items that belong to the same factor, it is not problematic. The CFA results affirmed the convergent validity of teaching presence. Theoretically, it is expected to have a significant relationship between each factors of teaching presence (Arbaugh, 2007; Arbaugh & Hwang, 2006). However, the CFA results yielded a high standardized covariance between direct instruction and facilitation indicating that these two factors may not be unique factors. This result raised the question whether teaching presence has three factors as proposed by the CoI framework or two factors as suggested by Shea et al. (2006) and Arbaugh and Hwang (2006). Therefore, both two- and three-factor models were tested in the current study. Examining the chi-square difference and other fit indices showed that three-factor model demonstrates a better fit with the current sample. Unlike the studies suggesting a two-factor solution for teaching presence (Arbaugh, 2007; Shea et al., 2006), this study yielded a three- factor solution aligning with Arbaugh and Hwang's (2006) findings. Garrison and Arbaugh (2007) asserted that the discrepancy among studies might be related to the participants' college level. For instance, Shea et al.'s (2006) participants included undergraduate students while Arbaugh and Hwang's (2006) study included MBA students. Further, Garrison (2007) claimed that “undergraduate students may not be sophisticated enough to distinguish between facilitation and direct instruction” (p. 68). Moreover, depending on the design and facilitation approach, students may not differentiate between design and direct instruction or facilitation (Garrison et al., 2010). Another possible explanation for the discrepancy could be related to how an individual instructor addresses the three elements of teaching presence, as addressing only one or two elements may not be enough to establish effective teaching presence (Arbaugh & Hwang, 2006). Yet, it still remains as a question whether the discrepancy among study findings are related to course participants or course design and facilitation, or structure of teaching presence. All in all, more empirical studies with the data from multiple institutions and different level of participants are needed to determine the three-factor structure of teaching presence (Swan et al., 2009) as well as refine teaching presence survey items based on further distinguishing the factors of teaching presence, and the design and sequence of course activities (Arbaugh, 2007; Garrison et al., 2010). Future research should also consider the integration of items from the CoI instrument with the TPS to examine the construct validity of the teaching presence.

5.2. Does social presence demonstrate a clear three-factor solution aligning with the CoI framework?
The analysis on the social presence demonstrated a clear three-factor structure aligning with the CoI framework, estimating two covariance errors. The conceptualization of social presence is an ongoing discussion in the CoI literature and there is no agreement among researchers on the conceptualization as well as the definition of social presence (Kreijns et al., 2014; Lowenthal, 2010). Corresponding with the previous research, the results of this study also addressed concerns about the factor structure of social presence. Examination of the discriminant validity of social presence test indicated that affective expression and group cohesion might not be unique factors due to the high covariance between these factors. Given this, both two- and three-factor social presence models were tested in the current study, and then chi-square difference test was employed to compare these two models. Since combining affective expression and open communication factors did not contribute significantly to the model fit, three-factor model allowing two error covariances was considered the better model. Another discussion on the conceptualization of social presence is whether social presence measures more than one concept. For example, in their validation study, Carlon et al. (2012) found that social presence items loaded on two different factors, namely social comfort and social experience. The first factor consisted of open communication and group cohesion items except SP22 “Online discussions help me to develop sense of collaboration” and the second factor included affective expression items and SP22. This current study did not confirm this structure. In addition to the conceptualization of social presence, the results of this study also addressed need for refining social presence survey items. For instance, model indices for the final three-factor model also recommended potential cross loading for the items SP21 “I felt that my point of view was acknowledged by other course participants” and SP22 “Online discussions help me to develop a sense of collaboration” on both affective expression and group cohesion. Estimating these cross loadings made the model better, but it was not significant. In their review paper, Lowenthal and Dunlap (2014) discussed the issues with measuring social presence. They asserted that while other items in the scale focus on students' perceptions about how they present themselves as a real person, item SP 22 “Online discussions help me to develop a sense of collaboration” focuses on students' perceptions about others' behaviors/actions. Further, they indicated that it is expected for this item to be more related to other categories. Reasoning that online discussion forums are not the only place where group communication occurs, they pointed out that this item should either be stated more broadly or broken down into multiple questions in order to address different media. Likewise, Kozan and Richardson (2014) also found SP22 to be problematic since it is loaded on both social and cognitive presence with the following values 0.379 and 0.546. However, their CFA did not suggest a cross loading for this item. They also tested another model by removing this item but ultimately determined that the model did not signify a remarkable change to the model fitness. They further claimed that this might be related to a language issue as some of the social presence items use present tense whereas others were written with past tense.

5.3. Does cognitive presence demonstrate a clear four-factor solution aligning with the CoI framework?
The analysis of cognitive presence demonstrated a clear four-factor solution corresponding with the CoI framework estimating four error covariance errors. Consistent with Akyol and Garrison's (2008) results, the results of this study also showed a clear distinction among the phases (factors) of cognitive presence. One primary issue pointed out in the previous research on assessing cognitive presence in online learning environments is that students may not reach the integration and resolution phase (Akyol & Garrison, 2008; Garrison, 2007; Garrison et al., 2001; Vaughan & Garrison, 2005). One explanation would be related to course design and facilitation (Akyol & Garrison, 2008; Arbaugh, 2007; Garrison, 2007). Garrison (2007) indicated it is important to design appropriate collaborative activities, which include problem solving, identifying solution, evaluating solutions, and acting solution to move students to a resolution phase. As Swan et al. (2009) explained that in some cases the lack of reaching the integration and resolution levels might lie with the nature of assignments; “students were challenged to resolve a problem and explicit facilitation and direction provided, students did progress to resolution” (p. 8). Similarly, sometimes “convergent thinking, hence resolution, is not the desired outcome” (Richardson et al., 2012, p. 7) (e.g. Literary understanding focuses on exploration and integration). Another explanation could be related to course duration; as Akyol and Garrison (2008) proposed, students may not have enough time to apply their final products and share the application results with others. It is also important to note that capturing cognitive presence can be problematic for studies using transcription analysis since it may not capture the whole cognitive inquiry process (Arbaugh, 2007; Swan et al., 2008). Arbaugh (2007) highlighted the need for using end of semester survey data to support transcription analysis. Future studies might focus on comparing how different course activities impact cognitive inquiry process by using both transcription analysis and end of semester survey data.

6. Conclusion
The literature on the conceptualization of the CoI framework has pointed out a need for examining the construct validity of each individual presences of the CoI framework. Yet, all the empirical studies have been conducted only focused on examining the factor structure of teaching presence by using the TPS instrument (Shea et al., 2003). By being the first study examining the construct validity of the teaching, social, and cognitive presences by using the CoI instrument, this study aimed to provide empirical evidence for the conceptualization and operationalization of each individual presence. In spite of the potential concerns with the conceptualization and operationalization of teaching presence and social presence, the results of this study confirmed the construct validity of the each presence as proposed by the CoI framework. The current findings also suggested refining teaching and social presence items distinguishing their factors.

There are limitations with the generalizability of the results. Data were gathered from online graduate students in a single program. Considering the highlights from previous research (e.g., Garrison, 2007), more empirical studies are needed to obtain data from learners across different student levels and disciplines. Thus, factor structure of the three presences should be examined with the data obtained from multiple institutions and different level of participants. In addition, future research focusing on the psychometric properties of the CoI instrument as well as the individual presences is also suggested.

The increasing validity of three dimensions of the CoI carries implications for researchers interested in the CoI framework, course designers, practitioners, and instructors. Researchers can use the results from this study for assessing the three presences of CoI in online learning environments as well as their influences on student learning outcomes. Furthermore, practitioners and course designers can use the results from this study in course design and as a program assessment tool. For example, by looking to the instrument one can reverse engineer the types of activities, the operationalization of the items that should be included to make a course align more fully with the CoI model. For designers looking to move to a more inquiry-based approach or to implement a more social-constructivist approach, the instrument item indicators, and thus the CoI model, are a means to do so.
