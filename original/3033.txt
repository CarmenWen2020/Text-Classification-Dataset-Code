This study used nationally representative data and employed multinomial logistic regression to examine the changing profile of online students in American higher education. Although online education continues to become an increasingly mainstream mode of instruction, certain student groups may engage disproportionately with computer-mediated instruction. Weighted descriptive statistics revealed that the proportion of postsecondary students who enrolled in online courses increased from 5.9% in 2000 to 32.1% in 2012, with 23.6% of students enrolled in some online courses and 8.5% of students enrolled in fully online programs. Empirical evidence suggested that student characteristics associated with the highest opportunity costs of engaging with residential education—such as being a full-time employee, parent, or married—were more likely to enroll in some online courses and online-only programs. In addition, economically and socially disadvantaged students were typically less likely to engage with online education.

1. Introduction
Although colleges and universities are typically slow to adopt change in any form, many higher education institutions throughout the United States (U.S.) face considerable pressure to incorporate online education into their institutional plans. By serving as a more convenient alternative to face-to-face instruction, online education has provided new and improved ways for postsecondary students to gain access to previously unavailable educational opportunities. Online education was previously considered a niche offering intended solely for time- and location-constrained students, but it has become an increasingly mainstream mode of instruction and the main source of enrollment growth in American higher education (Sener, 2012).

Despite the growth of online education in American higher education, minimal research has examined the various student populations and institution types of online learners. Because a variety of background characteristics can influence postsecondary students' academic achievement (Pascarella and Terenzini, 1991, Pascarella and Terenzini, 2005), online learners cannot be studied as a homogenous group. In addition, student patterns of online enrollment across different institution types may have changed over time given that the purpose of online education has expanded beyond solely providing outreach for non-traditional students, such as working adults and individuals from rural populations (Altbach et al., 2011, Dabbagh, 2007). Surprisingly, past research examining postsecondary online learners has failed to adequately address which types of students and institutions are most engaged in online education, how both student and institutional characteristics of online learners have changed over time, and whether student and institutional characteristics vary according to the level of engagement with online education.1 This study addresses the following research question: To what extent do student and institutional characteristics of undergraduate students relate to online course enrollment decisions? This paper also considers whether these characteristics vary according to students' level of engagement with online education.

In order to understand the importance of these questions, the financial and technological contexts associated with the rapid growth of online education in American higher education should be considered. Costs in higher education have continued to rise at a faster pace than costs in the overall economy (Bowen, 2013). In response to the financial challenges facing colleges and universities, higher education leaders have felt the pressure to increase their reliance on alternative revenue sources, such as online education. Many higher education leaders hope that online enrollments will continue to grow to the extent that new revenues exceed new costs in order to ‘bend the cost curve’ and potentially subsidize other parts of the institution (Deming, Goldin, Katz, & Yuchtman, 2015).

In addition, a variety of improvements in digital technology have allowed for a wider array of options for institutions of higher education considering online education. Online courses are no longer merely identical versions of classroom instruction delivered via the Internet. Technological advances allow for online courses to incorporate a variety of media and tools in their delivery, such as learning management systems, video lectures, interactive tutorials, animations, adaptive software, discussion boards, and so forth. Online courses serve as a natural response to higher education students' desire for convenience. Online alternatives to the residential classroom experience have decoupled learning and student services from time- and geographic-based constraints facing postsecondary students because online learners can be accommodated in ways that do not force them to align with rigid class times and office hours associated with the traditional collegiate experience at brick-and-mortar colleges and universities (LeBlanc, 2013).

By embracing non-traditional students, online education has been able to reach previously underserved learners whose life circumstances—such as work, family obligations, or other obstacles—precluded their pursuit of residential postsecondary education (Sener, 2012). The logic of this dynamic can be explained by the microeconomic concept of opportunity costs, which describes the cost of doing one thing as the consequent loss of any foregone alternatives (Mankiw, 1998). For example, face-to-face education has high opportunity costs for postsecondary students who would be forced to forego employment or caregiving responsibilities, but online education would provide a substantially lower opportunity cost for those non-traditional students. Despite the potential of online education to increase access for various student populations across institution types, the vast majority of research pertaining to online education in the U.S. is not generalizable beyond individual courses or community colleges2 and fails to differentiate between the residential student taking one online course and the non-traditional learner enrolled in a fully online program. As a result, the current state of research on online education has limited value for administrators and policymakers at the majority of American colleges and universities (Lack, 2013). Through an empirical analysis of national data from the U.S., this study addresses these issues by describing individual characteristics of online students, outlining how online enrollment choices vary according to institutional characteristics, and examining whether student and institutional characteristics vary according to the level of engagement with online education.

2. Literature review
The notion of providing course content from a distance is not a new development in American higher education. Before online education, colleges and universities attempted to reach audiences from a distance via radio and television, but these efforts generated only limited success (Bok, 2013). In 1995, only 9% of American adults accessed the Internet. By 2010, roughly 77% of all Americans had internet access in their homes (Moore & Kearsley, 2012). Due largely to this increased access to the Internet, the audience for higher education has expanded well beyond the confines of college and university campuses. Allen and Seaman (2014) reported that the percentage of students taking at least one online course has increased from 9.6% in 2002 to 33.5% in 2012, but the authors have deferred to federal government data since 2012 (Straumsheim, 2015). The recent growth of online education in the U.S. can also be explained by the Higher Education Reconciliation Act (HERA). In 2006, HERA overturned the “50% rule” that required higher education institutions to offer no more than 50% of courses online in order for their students to qualify for Title IV federal funds. Once online students could receive equal access to federal student aid, colleges and universities, particularly for-profit institutions, offered more online courses and the already-burgeoning industry of online education continued to grow at an even faster pace (Mettler, 2014).

2.1. Student and institutional characteristics
Pascarella and Terenzini, 1991, Pascarella and Terenzini, 2005 reported that student characteristics are significant predictors of postsecondary students' college experiences and learning outcomes. As calls to provide generalizable evidence of the quality of online instruction become louder (Bowen, 2013), the changing profile of online students in the U.S. has become increasingly important given that certain student populations and institution types may engage disproportionately with online education. Postsecondary online learners no longer appear to be a homogenous group of time- and place-bound students, but increases in access through online education may only attract a select group of postsecondary students (Jaggars, 2014a). For instance, Jaggars (2012) described that community college students who enrolled in at least one online course were typically older, more likely to be employed full-time, less likely to be minorities, less likely to be low-income, and less likely to be academically underprepared when compared to those who chose to enroll solely in face-to-face courses. These findings may give credence to the ‘digital divide’ referenced in previous literature, which alludes to the social and economic gap between underprivileged individuals who do not have easy access to computers and their peers who do (Hoffman and Novak, 1998, Hoffman and Novak, 1999, Strover, 1999, Norris, 2001).

In a national study of community college students in the U.S., Shea and Bidjerano (2014) provided some student and institutional characteristics of distance learners from 2004. For instance, among students enrolled in distance educations courses at community colleges, 65.8% of distance learners were female and 66.4% were White—which represented a larger majority than the proportion of female and White students who did not enroll in distance education courses. Xu and Jaggars, 2011, Xu and Jaggars, 2013a, Xu and Jaggars, 2013b also provided descriptive demographic characteristics for students enrolled in the state of Washington's community and technical colleges from 2004 to 2009. Previous research conducted by these authors has contributed to higher education scholarship, but the scope of their findings is restricted solely to community college students.

The convenience, flexibility, and self-paced workload of online courses have been referenced as beneficial components to the likelihood of success for older and working postsecondary online students. Online education has the potential to allow adult learners to continue their educational path without experiencing negative ramifications on their employment or family obligations (Yukselturk & Bulut, 2007). Although their study was restricted to first-year and senior college students at 45 American higher education institutions, Chen, Lambert, and Guidry (2010) found that minority and part-time students were more likely to enroll in online courses. Findings by Chen et al. appear to contradict Jaggars (2012) regarding the likelihood of minorities to enroll in postsecondary online courses in the U.S., but these discrepancies highlight the need for a generalizable, cross-institutional study of the background characteristics of postsecondary online learners.

Similar to student characteristics, institutional characteristics can also impact the college experiences and learning outcomes of postsecondary students (Pascarella and Terenzini, 1991, Pascarella and Terenzini, 2005). The proportion of American higher education institutions offering online education in some form has increased from 71.7% in 2002 to 86.5% in 2012. The motivation and growth of online education varies according to institution type, but a large percentage of the proliferation of online offerings can be explained by institutions moving from offering the occasional online course to providing complete fully online degree programs to their students. Specifically, the percentage of American higher education institutions offering fully online degree programs increased from 34.5% in 2002 to 62.4% in 2012 (Allen & Seaman, 2014).

Community colleges began offering online coursework in the 1990s (Mullins, 2007). After 2000, online enrollments in the U.S. increased more rapidly at community colleges relative to four-year institutions. By 2007, over 97% of community colleges offered online courses, but only 66% of all postsecondary institutions offered online education (Parsad & Lewis, 2008). When compared to students enrolled at four-year institutions, community college students are more likely to be older, working, part-time, and first-generation students who may not be able to afford the cost or time commitments associated with the traditional, four-year college experience (Attewell et al., 2006, Choy, 2001, Pascarella et al., 2004).

Due to the increasing demand for American higher education, online education has become an attractive business proposition for several prominent for-profit universities. Contrary to many prestige-seeking institutions in the nonprofit sector, for-profit institutions are often concerned with resources over quality and prestige. Although Bowen (2013) has referenced the cost crisis in higher education as a primary motivator for the proliferation of online education, Schiffman, Vignare, and Geith (2007) found several more nuanced and statistically significant differences among various higher education institution types in their analysis of administrators' reasons for engaging with online learning. Most notably, chief academic officers at public colleges and universities throughout the U.S. were more likely to implement online education to contribute to extension efforts, but administrators at private colleges and universities were more likely to use online education as a medium to return a surplus to the institution. Allen and Seaman's (2014) annual report on the opinions of higher education administrators also addresses the need to account for institutional characteristics when examining postsecondary online enrollment patterns. As noted above, previous studies reveal largely inconclusive and conflicting evidence pertaining to the student and institutional characteristics of online learners in the U.S., but this study provides empirical findings related to the profile of postsecondary online learners across a variety of student populations and higher education institution types.

2.2. Related studies using National Center for Education Statistics data from the U.S
Parsad and Lewis (2008) and the U.S. Department of Educations (2014) used institution-level data to describe distance education offerings and enrollments of American higher education institutions. Radford (2011) complemented their work by using student-level data to examine undergraduate enrollment in distance education courses and programs in the U.S. Although Radford advanced previous work regarding the profile of online learners in higher education, this study expands upon her line of research in three important ways.

First, this study distinguishes between distance education and online education, which is particularly critical when discussing enrollment patterns during earlier years. The conflation of these two teaching techniques is problematic as the broader category of distance education includes earlier technologies, such as correspondence courses, educational television, and videoconferencing. Second, this study also provides a more nuanced and advanced analysis to describe the changing profile of online learners and also examine the probability of multiple student populations and students at various institution types enrolling in some online courses or fully online programs over time. Although Radford's (2011) study provided a percentage of undergraduates who enrolled in distance education courses in 2000, 2004, and 2008, her work only examined student and institutional characteristics of distance learners in 2008. Third, the landscape of online education has already changed rapidly since Radford's study. According to Allen and Seaman (2014), the percentage of students enrolled in at least one online course increased from 24.1% after the 2007–2008 academic year to 33.5% after the 2011–2012 academic year. By incorporating National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) data from 2012, this study captures those students not examined during a burgeoning period of growth for online education in higher education.

3. Conceptual framework
The conceptual framework of this study provides a logical narrative to explain the rationale behind the inclusion of the identified hypotheses in order to examine the influence of various student and institutional characteristics on the decision to enroll in online courses. This study is guided in part by the microeconomic concept of opportunity costs, which highlights the cost of foregone alternatives such that the cost of doing one thing is all of the other things an individual will not be able to do as a result (Mankiw, 1998). For some postsecondary students, residential education has high opportunity costs. The time and geographic demands associated with face-to-face instruction would likely force these students to forego employment, caregiving, or other important responsibilities. Online education, particularly asynchronous online education, would then carry a significantly lower opportunity cost relative to residential education.

Hypothesis 1

Student characteristics associated with time or geographic constraints will be positively related to online enrollment.

Hypothesis 1 relates to many of the independent variables to be included in the empirical analysis. Students who hold a full-time job may have to resign their position and accept a lower-paid, part-time position if they were to enroll in a residential education program (Jaggars, 2014b). Students who are parents or married may have family responsibilities not amenable to the rigid class schedule of traditional higher education. Despite considerable progress toward gender equality over the years, roughly 53% to 68% of caregivers are female (American Psychological Association, 2015). As a result, female students may be more amenable to the convenience and flexibility of online education when compared to male students. Older students would also appear to be more likely to have work or family obligations relative to their younger peers. Finally, veteran students may need to engage in prohibitive travel or be stationed away from their home institutions (Hendrickson, Lane, Harris, & Dorman, 2013). To summarize, Hypothesis 1 suggests that online education will be positively related to the following variables: full-time employment, parent, married, female, age, and veteran.

Hypothesis 2

Student characteristics associated with historical underrepresentation in higher education will be negatively related to online enrollment.

In addition to time and geographic considerations, additional factors can also help to frame the decision to enroll in some online courses or fully online programs. According to Engle and Tinto (2008), students from disadvantaged backgrounds—such as minorities, low-income students, and first-generation students—have not received equal opportunities in their pursuit of higher education over the years. Hypothesis 2 suggests that this trend is only exacerbated when considering postsecondary online enrollment due to the expense of technology, limited internet access, weak support services, and various other considerations referenced in the digital divide literature (Hoffman and Novak, 1998, Hoffman and Novak, 1999, Strover, 1999, Norris, 2001). As a result, Hypothesis 2 proposes that online education will be negatively related to being a minority, low-income, and first-generation student.

Hypothesis 3

Institutional characteristics associated with missions more focused on access provision or revenue generation than status improvement will be positively related to online enrollment.

For selective institutions of higher education, the scarcity of their admitted students and degrees granted represent valuable currencies associated with the perception of their status (Ortagus, 2016). Although many colleges and universities are status-seeking entities, certain institution types, such as community colleges or for-profit institutions, are more motivated by increasing access or generating revenue than improving status. As open-access institutions, the missions of community colleges and for-profit institutions do not align with the pursuit of status improvement (Hendrickson et al., 2013). More specifically, community colleges typically engage the surrounding area to serve as an access point into higher education, while for-profit institutions seek to optimize their revenue in order to maximize the net profit accrued for their owners (Mullins, 2007, Kinser, 2007), both of which can be conducive to the implementation of online education. Hypothesis 3, therefore, suggests that online enrollment will be positively related to students attending community colleges and for-profit institutions.

4. Data and methods
This study used nationally representative data sources from the U.S. for student and institutional variables. Secondary data used to explain online enrollment patterns over time were drawn from NPSAS. More specifically, NPSAS data for 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012 were appended and merged to create a comprehensive, cross-sectional data set used to describe and examine how different student and institutional characteristics relate to online enrollment patterns. Although NPSAS is best known as a wide-ranging study of financial aid among postsecondary students, it provides extensive data pertaining to student and institutional characteristics. In addition, NPSAS also includes a variety of distance education variables, which can be manipulated to examine online enrollment over time. By examining four NPSAS surveys between 2000 and 2012, this study provides a rich description of how patterns of enrollment in online education in American higher education changed over this time period.

The NPSAS sample in 2000 (NPSAS:00) included all respondents to interviews conducted using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) procedure. After adjusting for institution non-response, the overall number of eligible sample members was roughly 29,370. This particular distinction is critical because the survey question pertaining to online enrollment was only a component of CATI data collection for NPSAS:00. After cleaning data to account for systematically missing cases, the final number of respondents for NPSAS:00 was 28,677. Similar procedures were carried out pertaining to the NPSAS sample in 2004 (NPSAS:04), but imputations3 increased the total number of undergraduate students included in the NPSAS:04 sample from 53,490 to 74,556. After imputing missing values from student and institutional data, the NPSAS sample in 2008 (NPSAS:08) increased from 95,360 undergraduate students to 108,848 undergraduate students to be examined. The NPSAS sample in 2012 (NPSAS:12) originally consisted of roughly 94,200 undergraduate students. After cleaning missing data for key variables to be included in the analysis, the final NPSAS:12 sample included 90,277 respondents. Sample weights for all NPSAS surveys were applied to ensure generalizability and the national population of undergraduate students was represented appropriately.

4.1. Variables
The dependent variable for this study captures whether the undergraduate student enrolled in online courses in 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012. Online enrollment is typically operationalized as a dichotomous variable indicating whether a student enrolled in no online courses or at least one online course. Unfortunately, this particular strategy confounds residential students who may take only one online course with students who enroll in fully online programs. In order to address this problematic confound, the dichotomous course-taking variables were manipulated to differentiate among respondents who took no distance education courses, some distance education courses, and all distance education courses.4 In addition, this analysis utilizes the course-taking variable that captured whether the distance education course used the Internet. This distinction is also important as previous studies have conflated students enrolled in courses at a distance and those enrolled in online courses, which is particularly problematic for earlier years of online offerings as computer-mediated instruction comprised a lower proportion of distance education courses (Allen & Seaman, 2014).

The independent variables include student and institutional characteristics that covary with online enrollment in 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012. After reviewing the literature, the following student and institutional characteristics were included as predictors of online enrollment over time: gender, race, age, major, class level, attendance intensity, employment, low-income, first-generation, parent, married, target institution distance from the student's home, institution control, institution level, institutional selectivity, and degree of urbanization.

Due to the structure of the multi-category dependent variable of online enrollment, this study employs a multinomial logistic regression model, which creates a logistic regression equation for the outcome variable categories minus one for the base outcome of student enrollment in no online courses. Multinomial logistic regression is the most appropriate analytic technique to employ, as it allows for the estimation of the pairwise comparisons of nominal or unordered categorical variables. For the purposes of this study, multinomial logistic regression models can describe online course-taking across a variety of student and institutional characteristics in order to outline trends and identify any disproportionate relationships among student characteristics, institution types, and online course-taking. The following general equation is used in the multinomial logistic regression model to display the log odds of membership in the identified category (enrolled in some or all online courses) relative to the reference category (did not enroll in online courses):
 

where j is the identified group, J is the reference group, and X is a vector of the student and institutional characteristics outlined as predictors within the models.

Multinomial logistic regression coefficients (b) were initially expressed in terms of log odds. A unit change in the independent variable was associated with a b unit change in the log of the odds of the identified outcome occurring. In order to simplify interpretation, the majority of these findings are reported in terms of odds ratios, which raise e to the power of b. The odds ratio represents the factor change in the odds of an outcome associated with a one-unit change in the independent variable. For continuous independent variables, a one-unit change will be one unit on its measurement. For dichotomous independent variables, a one unit change will move the variable from 0 (outside of the group) to 1 (within the group).

5. Results
The overall proportion of students taking no, some, or all online courses within these samples affirms previous literature describing the growth of online education over the past decade (Allen and Seaman, 2014, Radford, 2011). Table 1 and Fig. 1 show that the proportion of students taking some online courses has increased from 3.4% in 2000 to 23.6% in 2012. For students enrolled in fully online programs, the percentage of students taking all courses online grew from 2.5% in 2000 to 8.5% in 2012. The total proportion of postsecondary students who enrolled in at least one online course increased from 5.9% in 2000 to 32.1% in 2012.

Weighted descriptive statistics within this study focus primarily upon the changing student and institutional characteristics of online learners between 2000 and 2012. Although several interesting trends are described below, the complete tables for 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012 can be found in the Appendix (Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5). The vast majority of postsecondary students enrolled in some (72.0%) or all (69.6%) online courses in 2000 were White, but that proportion decreased over time. By 2012, White students represented 61.2% of students enrolled in some online courses and 63.0% of students in fully online programs. From 2000 to 2012, Business, Health, and Technical/Professional majors engaged with some or all online courses at a greater rate than their peers. For instance, Health majors comprised 9.5% of undergraduate students enrolled in some online courses in 2000, but that proportion increased to 19.5% in 2012. In addition, the proportion of part-time students who solely enrolled in online courses actually decreased over time, as exclusively part-time students comprised 49.0% of fully online learners in 2000 but only 23.3% of students enrolled in fully online programs by 2012.

Among students enrolled in fully online programs, the proportion of students at two-year institutions (or community colleges) decreased from 51.7% in 2000 to 29.4% in 2012. Conversely, the proportion of postsecondary fully online students enrolled at for-profit institutions increased substantially over the years, growing from 1.1% in 2000 to 33.8% in 2012. The percentage of online students enrolled at high-enrollment institutions also increased considerably. For students enrolled in fully online programs, the percentage of students at higher education institutions with enrollment numbers greater than 60,000 jumped from 0% in 2000 to 10.8% in 2008 and 19.4% in 2012. Although the proportion of students in some online courses at public institutions increased slightly from 2000 (73.9%) to 2012 (76.6%), the proportion of fully online students at public institutions decreased substantially from 74.4% in 2000 to 47.3% in 2012 (likely due in large part to the rise of for-profits during this period).

In order to examine the hypotheses outlined earlier, this study employs multinomial logistic regression to examine the relationship between each characteristic and online enrollment. All reported claims are statistically significant (p < 0.05) and have students enrolled in no online courses as the reference group. Results pertaining to all multinomial logistic regression models are presented in Table 6.

Hypothesis 1

Student characteristics associated with time or geographic constraints will be positively related to online enrollment.

To test Hypothesis 1, this study examined whether being employed full-time, a parent, married, female, older, and a veteran are associated with significantly higher odds of postsecondary online enrollment. The findings revealed evidence in partial support of this hypothesis. As expected, being a full-time employee, being a parent, and being married were positively related to enrolling in some or all online courses in 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012. For example, the estimated odds of enrolling in some online courses were 34.2% higher in 2000 (p < 0.05) and 10.9% higher in 2012 (p < 0.05) for postsecondary students who were married. Married students were even more likely to engage with fully online programs when compared to their unmarried peers, as the estimated odds of enrolling in a fully online program increased by 53.9% in 2000 and 44.0% in 2012 for married students. Being a female, older, and veteran were also positively related to enrolling in some online courses and fully online degree programs, but not every model was statistically significant. For instance, the estimated odds of enrolling in a fully online program were 29.9% higher in 2008 (p < 0.05) for veterans, but positive coefficients in 2000, 2004, 2012 were not statistically significant.

Hypothesis 2

Student characteristics associated with historical underrepresentation in higher education will be negatively related to online enrollment.

Evidence also supported Hypothesis 2 regarding the negative relationship between online enrollment and low-income or minority students. Although the proportion of minority students who engage with online education has increased over time, the estimated odds of minority students enrolling in some online courses were 18.3% lower in 2004 (p < 0.001), 21.0% lower in 2008 (p < 0.001), and 13.9% lower in 2012 (p < 0.001) when compared to their White peers. For minority students, the estimated odds of enrolling in all online courses were 19.4% lower in 2004 (p < 0.001), 25.8% lower in 2008 (p < 0.001), and 24.8% lower in 2012 (p < 0.001). These multivariate findings support previous claims that minority students are less likely to engage with online education (Jaggars, 2012) and contradict other research suggesting that minority students were more likely to enroll in online courses (Chen et al., 2010).

The estimated odds of enrolling in all online courses were lower in 2004 (p < 0.05) and 2012 (p < 0.01) for low-income students, but findings pertaining to the relationship between low-income students and enrolling in some online courses were not statistically significant. Hypothesis 2 also included first-generation students as a variable of interest, but the results were mixed. For example, the estimated odds of enrolling in some online courses were 0.5% higher in 2004 (p < 0.05) but 7.9% lower in 2012 (p < 0.01) relative to their peers.

Hypothesis 3

Institutional characteristics associated with missions more focused on access provision or revenue generation than status improvement will be positively related to online enrollment.

For Hypothesis 3, the analysis focused specifically on online enrollment patterns at community colleges and for-profit institutions. Regarding the relationship between community college students and online enrollment, Hypothesis 3 was partially supported. The estimated odds of students at community colleges enrolling in some online courses were 15.7% higher in 2008 (p < 0.05) but 48.8% lower in 2012 (p < 0.001) relative to students at four-year institutions. When compared to students at four-year colleges and universities, the estimated odds of community college students enrolling in fully online programs were 34.7% lower in 2004 (p < 0.001), 40.1% lower in 2008 (p < 0.001), and 78.1% lower in 2012 (p < 0.001).

To test Hypothesis 3 in relation to students at for-profit institutions, the institutional control variable was recoded to compare students at for-profit institutions to students at a combination of public institutions and private, not-for-profit institutions. After making this adjustment, Hypothesis 3 was only partially supported, as students at for-profit institutions were less likely to enroll in some online courses but more likely to enroll in fully online programs during certain years. The estimated odds of students at for-profit institutions enrolling in some online courses were 38.6% lower in 2004 (p < 0.001), 50.5% lower in 2008 (p < 0.001), and 63.3% lower in 2012 (p < 0.001). As expected, the estimated odds of students at for-profit institutions enrolling in a fully online program were 68.5% higher in 2004 (p < 0.001) and 216.8% higher in 2008 (p < 0.001) relative to students at not-for-profit institutions. Postsecondary students at for-profit institutions were less likely to enroll in an online-online program in 2000 (p < 0.001).

6. Discussion and conclusions
6.1. Summary of major findings
Using a nationally representative data source, this study provides generalizable evidence of the profile of online students in American higher education. Online education has become an increasingly prominent medium of instruction in American higher education, but little empirical research has examined the profile of postsecondary online learners at the national level. The findings show that postsecondary online learners are not necessarily confined by niche characteristics that require the convenient and flexible benefits of online instruction to gain access to higher education, particularly for students who supplement their residential education with some online courses. Over the period of this study, postsecondary students who were employed full-time, parents, married, older, or veterans represented a lower proportion of students who enrolled in some online courses relative to their peers outside of these student populations. Despite these weighted descriptive findings, the student characteristics associated with the highest opportunity costs of engaging with residential education—such as being a full-time employee, parent, or married—were often more likely than their peers to enroll in some online courses and fully online programs.5

Multinomial logistic regression findings revealed that historically underrepresented groups and students enrolled in certain majors appear to engage differently with online education relative to their peers. Although the proportion of minority and low-income students enrolled in online education increased over time, both minority and low-income students were typically less likely to engage with online education. As Chen et al. (2010) noted, students who major in certain academic disciplines may be more apt to engage with online education when compared to their peers. Findings from this study suggest that Business and Health majors disproportionately increased their reliance on online education over time. Business majors were more likely to enroll in some online courses and fully online degree programs (p < 0.001), but Health majors were only more likely to engage with some online courses (p < 0.001).

Among students enrolled in some online courses and fully online programs, the proportion of community college students decreased during the time period of this study. When compared to students at four-year colleges and universities, multivariate evidence offered conflicted findings pertaining to whether community college students were more likely to enroll in some online courses, as the estimated odds of community college students were engaging with some online education were higher in 2008 but lower in 2012. In addition, the estimated odds of students at community colleges enrolling in a fully online program were lower relative to their peers at four-year institutions. The proportion of students enrolled in fully online programs at for-profit institutions increased substantially over time, but regression results pertaining to the likelihood of students at for-profit institutions to enroll in fully online programs were conflicted depending on the year being examined.

6.2. Limitations
Although this study provides several contributions to existing research, these results are subject to limitations. First, respondents from NPSAS:08 were not asked about the way in which distance education courses were taught in 2008 (unlike NPSAS surveys from 2000, 2004, and 2012). As a result, online students were not differentiated from distance learners who may be engaging solely with correspondence courses, educational television, or videoconferencing. The conflation between online learners and distance learners was not as problematic in 2008 as it would have been in earlier years because the overwhelming majority of distance education courses in 2008 were offered via online instruction. To use NPSAS:04 as a reference, roughly 87% of the students who took their entire degree program from a distance were enrolled in fully online programs. Additionally, roughly 88% of NPSAS:04 respondents who enrolled in some distance education courses utilized online education as their medium of instruction (author's calculations). Because the proportion of students enrolled in online education increased from 13.5% in 2004 to 24.1% in 2008 (Allen & Seaman, 2014), one could reasonably expect the percentage of distance education courses delivered online to be substantially higher for NPSAS:08.

Second, online education has complexities that make large-scale studies of online enrollment patterns highly complex and potentially problematic. In this study, students who enroll in one or two hybrid courses can be grouped with online learners who took the majority (but not all) of their courses completely online. Despite manipulating the data to differentiate between postsecondary students who enrolled in some online courses and those who enrolled in a fully online program, respondents were only asked whether their distance education course used the Internet. Any further nuance related to online course-taking would require the use of transcript data. In addition, the comparison of a low-enrollment seminar with a high-enrollment introductory course introduces a host of complexities that go beyond the scope of this study.

Third, this study is restricted to undergraduate students, but the impact of online education on graduate and professional education has been substantial. This limitation could have an impact on the institutional characteristics of online learners, particularly given the disproportionate emphasis on undergraduate education at for-profit colleges and universities. Finally, any developments since 2012 are not captured in this analysis due to data restrictions. For example, national enrollment numbers at for-profit institutions have decreased since 2012 (National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, 2014). Most notably, the University of Phoenix, the largest for-profit institution in the U.S., saw its enrollment numbers drop from roughly 460,000 to 213,000 students within the past five years (Strauss, 2015).

6.3. Implications and future research
The relationship between student characteristics and online enrollment may have important implications for policymakers concerned about access to higher education. Online education in American higher education has served as an effective medium for access to previously unavailable educational opportunities for students facing high opportunity costs associated with residential education, but significant work remains in order to ensure equal opportunities for historically underrepresented postsecondary students. More specifically, the multivariate findings provide generalizable evidence to support previous claims that low-income and minority students are less likely to engage with online education (Jaggars, 2012) and thereby contradict other research suggesting that minority students were more likely to enroll in online courses (Chen et al., 2010).

One of the most frequently referenced benefits of online education is its potential to reach underprivileged students whose life circumstances may have previously precluded their pursuit of higher education (Sener, 2012). Arne Duncan (2012), the former U.S. Secretary of Education, once claimed that “technology can level the playing field instead of tilting it against low-income, minority…students” (p. 4), but these projections have not necessarily come to fruition given that low-income and minority students are actually less likely to engage with computer-mediated instruction. Findings from this study related to low-income and minority students and online enrollment appear to give credence to the aforementioned issues presented within the digital divide literature (Hoffman and Novak, 1998, Hoffman and Novak, 1999, Strover, 1999, Norris, 2001). Institutional leaders who seek to improve access and diversity efforts through online education can benefit from the nationally representative data presented within this study to identify specific populations who may not be leveraging computer-mediated instruction to the same extent as their more privileged peers.

Institutional findings also present some interesting trends beyond the technological and financial dynamics referenced previously as potential explanations regarding the growth of postsecondary online education. The for-profit sector, in particular, has played a significant role in the proliferation of fully online programs in American higher education. The growth of for-profit enrollment can be attributed in large part to policy changes in how financial aid was awarded during the time period of this study,6 which allowed for-profits to offer more online courses and online students to receive equal access to federal student aid (Mettler, 2014). This study only uses data from colleges and universities within the U.S., but the presented findings can offer several contributions across higher education contexts. Given the empirical findings outlined previously, higher education leaders and policymakers—both within and outside the U.S.—should examine trends at the individual and population level to identify the appropriate practices and policies to ensure equal opportunities and academic success for postsecondary online students.

National data pertaining to postsecondary online education in the U.S. have been very limited up to this point, but this study engages nationally representative data sources to supplement extant literature pertaining to the growing influence of online education in American higher education. Although this study distinguishes between levels of online enrollment, more nuanced studies in the future could leverage the use of transcript data to provide an in-depth analysis of how many courses are taken online and the impact of online enrollment on various academic outcomes. In addition, and perhaps most obviously, findings within this study are restricted to undergraduate students in the U.S., but future research examining online enrollment patterns in graduate school and other countries would be positive contributions to this growing body of literature.
