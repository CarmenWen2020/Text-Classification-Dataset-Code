Online distance learning at university level is growing in popularity. Learners are often faced with the dual demands of full-time work and part-time studying. The present study examines whether psychological capital predicts learner engagement and burnout and whether social support moderates these relationships. Method: Postgraduate distance learning students who work alongside their studies (n=465) completed measures of psychological capital, burnout, engagement, and social support. Results: Analysis showed psychological capital to significantly predict both burnout and engagement. Furthermore, social support was found to be influential. Conclusion: The findings indicate the benefit of psychological capital in an academic context. Implications of these findings and potential interventions are discussed.

1. Introduction
1.1. Distance learning context
Distance learning (DL) at university level is growing in popularity (Wan Yunus, Mustafa, Nordin, & Malik, 2015). This in part can be attributed to the convenience and flexibility it offers its learners in comparison to full-time face-to-face traditional learning. DL provides an opportunity and flexibility for individuals to grow and develop themselves whilst working full-time or looking to get back into education after a period away (Bailey, Ifenthaler, Gosper, Kretzschmar, & Ware, 2015; Ilgaz & Gülbahar, 2015; Lee, Choi, Cho, & H., 2019; Vanslambrouck, Zhu, Lombaerts, Philipsen, & Tondeur, 2018; Wan Yunus et al., 2015), due to reasons such as social, cultural, personal or economic (Brändle, 2017; Lee et al., 2019). It is typical for students to complete both their bachelor and master degrees in one go before commencing work. However, research has shown that it is also the case that some students take breaks from studying, and do not complete their degrees in one go (Lee et al., 2019). Therefore, this combination of convenience and flexibility is what makes DL (or online/ e-learning) an attractive proposition to prospective students.

DL students are often reported to be more independent and self-regulated in their learning approach (Hashim, Hashim, & Esa, 2011). This independence, remoteness and the lack of peer socialisation (often due to students not having time to socialise due to working full time alongside studying part time and other life commitments) may in part be responsible for feelings of isolation and the higher dropout rates common to this type of study (Borup, West, & Graham, 2012; Heidrich et al., 2018; Levy, 2007). Moreover, learners are often faced with the dual demands of work and studying, and this can outweigh the available resources of an individual (such as time and energy). This can have repercussions on both academic and workplace performance, as well as on personal wellbeing (Butler, 2007; Calderwood & Gabriel, 2017). Evidence has shown inter-role conflict between work and academic life can negatively impact an individual’s academic performance (Butler, 2007), leaving them dissatisfied, tired, and fatigued (Cheng & McCarthy, 2013; Park & Sprung, 2015). It can also affect their perception of the university (Creed, French, & Hood, 2015). Heavy workloads from job contexts are also often cited as a central reason behind course dropouts (Choi, Lee, Jung, & Latchem, 2013; Lee, 2017). This can be explained through the depletion model (see Creed et al., 2015). This model proposes we have set psychological and physical resources, and that when expending these in one role it reduces those available for another. In this context work initially reduces the resources available to the individual, leaving less resource for the academic role. This ties in with McPartlan, Rutherford, Rodriguez, Shaffer, and Holton (2021) who reported online learners with competing responsibilities (such as work) spent less time on academic activities and ultimately performed worse academically. Though there is an argument to be made that the dual demands may in fact produce synergistic benefits of studying enhancing work performance and vice-versa (e.g., Butler, 2007; Wang, Kong, Shan, & Vong, 2010).

The majority of previous research (Butler, 2007; Calderwood & Gabriel, 2017; Park & Sprung, 2015) focuses on undergraduate and college students’ work demands and engagement. However, the current study examines postgraduate DL students who are predominantly working and are studying alongside. This is an under researched population and reiterates the timeliness of this research. Workplace impacts are important not to underestimate, though the primary focus of the present research concerns academic outcomes. More specifically the main aim of this study is to examine the extent to which psychological capital (PsyCap – a composite construct originating from positive psychology made up from self-efficacy, optimism, hope and resilience) as a personal resource impacts on student burnout and engagement in postgraduate DL students who are working full-time and pursuing their education part-time.

The growing popularity of online learning has created a fast-evolving student population within the education sector. This has left some institutions and educators unsure of the best way to support students working alongside their studies and how to improve their learning experience (Calderwood & Gabriel, 2017). Yet the development and enhancement of areas such as technological infrastructure for DL offers the dual benefit of also improving the learning experience for campus-based face-to-face students (LSB, 2017). Furthermore, as DL numbers and online provision infrastructure develops, this mode of study looks set to become an attractive alternative to traditional face-to-face study. Beyond this, the recent Covid-19 outbreak resulted in many universities moving their studies online. It is therefore timely to identify the factors that could improve DL student experience. Hence, this study addresses postgraduate DL from a pedagogy standpoint, by investigating social support (an external resource) as an underlying mechanism for understanding the associations between PsyCap (a personal resource), burnout and engagement.

1.2. The role of demands and resources
To theoretically contextualise this research we, like Luthans, Luthans, and Palmer (2016), draw on the job-demands resource model (JD-R; Bakker & Demerouti, 2007). The JD-R model proposes that job strain develops as a result of high job demands (such as organisational, social, psychological, and physical) and low resources. The model comprises of two processes. The first part constitutes the demands strand, whereby sustained demands over time wears down employee mental and physical wellbeing and impacts on motivation, energy levels and burnout (Demerouti, Bakker, Nachreiner, & Schaufeli, 2001). The second strand is the resource part of the model, which has a motivational potential that buffers the impact of job demands and the associated undesirable physical and psychological costs. Accordingly, we propose that individuals having dual demands whilst working full-time and studying part-time as DL students would seek to maintain their resources to improve engagement and wellbeing. The resources can be split in to external (organisational/ job or social) and internal (personal or cognitive) factors (Bakker & Demerouti, 2017; Demerouti et al., 2001; Richter & Hacker, 1998). For example, social support and PsyCap represents an external and internal resource respectively.

Personal psychological resources have been identified as being particularly fruitful in enhancing engagement and promoting learning and development (Bakker, Demerouti, & Schaufeli, 2003; Hakanen, Bakker, & Schaufeli, 2006; Ouweneel, LeBlanc, & M., & Schaufeli, W.B., 2011). This coupled with Luthans et al. (2016) demonstrating psychological resources in the form of PsyCap to be influential in leading to undergraduate students’ engagement, provides a basis for the present research. The current research seeks to further extend Luthans and his colleague’s research on student engagement to postgraduate distance learners, as to the researchers’ knowledge, no previous study has been conducted with this sample. More specifically we looked to examine the relationship between PsyCap and engagement to establish whether the findings of Luthans and colleagues extends to this distinct student population. Moreover, given the dual demands often concomitant to this type of students we seek to establish the relationship between PsyCap and burnout. In addition, due to the remote nature of DL we look to examine whether the external resource of social support acts as a moderating buffer on these relationships.

The first contribution of this study is to extend the current literature that has researched in the context of education (e.g., Luthans et al., 2016: Nielsen, et al., 2017) and identify whether the above mentioned theory and previous findings extend to the DL population with respect to engagement. This links to our second contribution of extending these previous findings beyond undergraduate level students to postgraduate DL students and investigating the impacts of PsyCap on burnout; and identifying what leads to improved engagement and lower burnout in DL students. This is born out of the dual demands this population faces (work and academic) and the strain it places on their limited personal resources. Through identifying the influence of personal resources (PsyCap) and external resources (social support) findings from this study will create avenues to develop interventions to enhance personal resources (such as PsyCap) or develop support networks and systems to support DL students. With the increase in the number of DL students worldwide, this study is a timely contribution in pedagogical research. Our final key contribution relates to the role of external resources, and specifically social support of significant others, family and peer networks. This helps identify how support may buffer against burnout and enhance engagement, whilst answering calls of previous research to examine and identify possible factors that may moderate the relationship between PsyCap and its outcomes (Newman, Ucbasaran, Zhu, & Hirst, 2014).

In summary in the context of the dual demands distance learning students are often faced with; we seek to examine and clarify the relationship between personal resources (PsyCap) and (1) burnout and (2) academic engagement. Furthermore, we look to identify the moderating role the external resource social support has on these relationships.

1.3. Psychological Capital
Psychological Capital (PsyCap) is a composite construct that originates from positive psychology (Luthans, 2002). It consists of four distinct yet converging elements: self-efficacy, optimism, hope and resilience. It is considered an individual’s positive psychological state of development and is characterised by: having belief (self-efficacy) to input the required effort to succeed; being positive (optimism) about succeeding now and in the future; persevering toward goals and, if required, adjusting paths and plans to reach them (hope) to ensure success; and when beset by problems, sustaining effort and bouncing back (resilience) to achieve success Luthans, Youssef and Avolio (2007). PsyCap has been extensively researched and shown to link to desirable outcomes including positive attitudes, performance, engagement, wellbeing and organisational citizenship behaviour; as well as to negatively relate to undesirable behaviours including work stress and anxiety (see Avey, Reichard, Luthans, & Mhatre, 2011; Luthans, Avolio, Avey, & Norman (2007); Luthans, Avey, Avolio, Norman, & Combs, 2006; Luthans & Youseff-Morgan, 2017; Newman et al., 2014).

Similarly, in academia PsyCap has been associated to positive outcomes such as greater life satisfaction, higher academic performance, learning empowerment, adjustment and engagement in undergraduate and college students (Hazan Liran & Miller, 2019; Hee Woo & Young Park, 2017; Liao & Liu, 2016; Luthans et al., 2016; Luthans, Luthans, & Jensen, 2012; Martinez, Meneghel, Carmona-Halty, & Youseff-Morgan, 2019; Martinez, Youseff-Morgan, Chambel, & Marques-Pinto, 2019; Ortega-Maldonado & Salanova, 2018; Siu, Bakker, & Jiang, 2014; Won You, 2016). It has also been shown to bolster academic motivation, engagement and achievement (Datu, King, & Valdez, 2018). Given the often independent and lone working nature of online learning (Borup et al., 2012; Hashim et al., 2011) it can be argued PsyCap and its components take on an increased importance in this type of learner. This is further demonstrated whereby the sub-components of PsyCap have also been shown to have utility in student research on outcomes including burnout (Chang, Rand, & Strunk, 2000; Ching, Cheung, Hegney, & Rees, 2020; Valentine, DuBois, & Cooper, 2004), academic performance, course and life satisfaction (Hwang & Shin, 2018; Rand, Martin, & Shea, 2011; Richardson, Abraham, & Bond, 2012; Valentine et al., 2004). PsyCap is considered a personal resource that is “state like” and is consequently malleable and able to be developed through training interventions (Luthans, 2002; Luthans, Youssef, & Avolio, 2007; Luthans & Youssef, 2007). These interventions, including an example of a one-off two-hour session (Luthans, Luthans, & Avey, 2014; Luthans et al., 2006) designed to increase levels of hope, efficacy, resilience, and optimism individually (as well as the individual’s overall PsyCap level), has been shown previously to increase undergraduate student PsyCap levels (Ertosun, Erdil, Deniz, & Alpkan, 2015; Luthans et al., 2014; Luthans, Avey, Avolio, & Peterson, 2010). The implication in the present research is that if PsyCap is found to lead to higher engagement and lower burnout in DL students, then interventions can be designed to help develop PsyCap levels, and therefore personal resources, in this population.

The previous research has focussed on undergraduate and college students in the main. The focus here, however, is on the postgraduate DLs, in order to identify the utility of PsyCap levels in the context of preparing them for the dual demands of work and academic study. The potential to overcome these dual demands offers a prominent gap to fill in the literature and one that has both practical and theoretical importance. PsyCap has potential to positively impact students learning experience. To our knowledge research has not yet looked at the impact of PsyCap and whether its effects can be extended to DL students. This is one prominent gap this research will address. We propose that if PsyCap is found to be influential then the impact on DL students can be two-fold. Firstly, it can identify those individuals better suited to DL and the challenges concomitant to this type of learning. Secondly, it can help identify those students who may benefit from interventions to enhance their PsyCap levels and in turn enhance their chances of successful studying from an engagement and burnout perspective.

1.4. PsyCap and burnout
Burnout is characterised by emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and reduced feelings of personal accomplishment (Maslach & Jackson, 1981). A high workload has been consistently shown to predict burnout (Bakker, Demerouti, & Euwema, 2005). Burnout can occur due to the pressure of having to meet dual demands of differing roles and the perception of having too much to do in too little time (Schaufeli & Enzmann, 1998). DL students often work alongside their studies and this is an example of dual demands. This has been shown to be the prominent reason for drop out and non-re-enrolment (Choi et al., 2013). Students are also susceptible to burnout due to the long hours they study, the assignments they have to complete, and dealing with numerous submission deadlines (Law, 2007). In an educational context burnout has been shown to be detrimental and to link to reduced performance and engagement (May, Bauer, & Fincham, 2015; Richardson et al., 2012).

Academic burnout results from work and academic overload (Valero-Chillerón et al., 2019) with exhaustion linking to lower academic performance (Richardson et al., 2012; Stewart, Lam, Betson, Wong, & Wong, 1999). When employed work takes up a large portion of students’ time it affects their study time and leaves them feeling tired (Creed et al., 2015). DL students report getting up early to squeeze in studying before work or working late into the night. It is also commonplace for them to sacrifice weekends (Lee et al., 2019). These demands over time take their toll, whilst students who work alongside their studies are also reported to be at higher risk of burnout more generally (Benner & Curl, 2018). This coupled with having other time-consuming life commitments (Lee et al., 2019) has created a prominent gap in the research. Namely to consider what leads to lower burnout for this population who are more susceptible to its effects given the cocktail of dual demands against limited resources. These effects are further compounded by learners often having heightened anxiety due to lower support networks, lack of DL experience, and the financial cost of education (Pozdnyakova & Pozdnyakov, 2017).

PsyCap has been shown to be negatively related to burnout in students working alongside their studies indicating that some students are likely to feel less burnout from their studies and be less cynical about their goals (Chang et al., 2000; Valentine et al., 2004). In line with previous literature and theory (such as Luthans, Luthans, & Luthans, 2004) we propose that the higher levels of academic PsyCap would be negatively correlated with burnout.

1.5. PsyCap and engagement
Engagement is defined as ‘a positive work-related state of fulfilment that is characterised by vigour, dedication and absorption’ (Schaufeli, Salanova, González-Romá, & Bakker, 2002, p.74). This definition can be applied to academic work too. Engagement in university students has long been researched and shown to link to academic grades, achievement, persistence, learner satisfaction and performance (e.g. Carini, Kuh, & Klein, 2006; Chen, Gonyea, & Kuh, 2008; Ketonen et al., 2019; Fredricks, Blumenfeld, & Paris, 2004; Schaufeli, Martínez, Pinto, Salanova, & Bakker, 2002). Research on college students has shown those who work alongside their studies report limited engagement (Benner & Curl, 2018). However, given the more remote nature of DL, the frequent dual demands of full-time work, and the lack of a physical venue and structured sessions to be present at, it means that the challenge of DL engagement comes in a different form.

Research has shown full-time university students who work part time sacrifice reading and assignment preparation in order to engage with part time work (Richardson, Evans, & Gbadamosi, 2014). Consequently, distance learners who often have work as their ‘main focus’ and studying as ‘part time’ may find this balance even more one sided. One type of burnout entails study-related exhaustion whereby the student experiences feelings of strain, particularly chronic fatigue resulting from taxing studying (Schaufeli, Martínez, et al., 2002). Identifying what leads to higher student engagement in DL students forms a second aim of the present research. Identification of these antecedents can lead to the development of interventions to enhance student engagement.

Engagement and burnout are distinct but related constructs. They are negatively associated with reduced engagement resulting from feelings of being overwhelmed or exhausted by multiple commitments (Cazan, 2015; Langelaan, Bakker, van Doornen, & Schaufeli, 2006; Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004; Schaufeli, Martínez, et al., 2002; Zhang, Gan, & Cham, 2007). It is duly anticipated that through identifying what leads to lower burnout it will also aid in the quest for uncovering precursors to higher engagement. This research will also look to confirm whether burnout is negatively associated with engagement as demonstrated in the previous research.

1.6. Social Support as a moderator
Social support represents an external resource. In a context such as DL where students work remotely having a strong perceived support network is vital. This is both to ensure engagement but also to prevent burnout. Research has shown that social support can mitigate the effects of stress (Bolger & Amarel, 2007; Halbesleben, 2006). This study looks to examine the role of social support with respect to its ability to inhibit or enhance the relationship between PsyCap and burnout/ engagement respectively.

Social support is referred to as the provision of material and psychological resources that help a recipient cope with stressful events (Cohen, 2004). This construct differs from social presence, which is extensively researched in online learning communities and relates to an individual’s ability to convey themselves as real people. Social presence is the extent to which they are seen as being present and belonging to a group even though the communication is via technology (Borup et al., 2012; Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, 2000; Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, 2010; Picciano, 2002). The present paper focuses on the broader social network support of family, friends and significant others. This relates to Borup, Graham, West, Archambault, and Spring (2020) Academic Communities of Engagement (ACE) framework, which classes this type of social support as that of personal community support.

Social support can take many forms ranging from family and peer support (personal community), through to supervisor, teaching, or more general support services provided by the university (course community) (Borup et al., 2020). There are many definitions of social support (see Farajollahi & Moenikia, 2010). In line with Cohen’s classification, we believe support should help buffer against burnout and help enhance engagement in students. This is in part shown in prior research whereby social support from friends, family or a significant other has influenced the ability of students to cope with university demands and develop greater educational engagement (Alarcon, Edwards, & Menke, 2011). Furthermore, social support has been identified to help individuals cope with studying demands (Alarcon et al., 2011; Ouweneel et al., 2011).

Research has previously examined the role of instructor support, family support and PsyCap in relation to wellbeing in postgraduate students (Nielsen, Newman, Smyth, Hirst, & Heilemann, 2017). Similar to the present research they grounded their work on the job demands resource model (Bakker & Demerouti, 2007; Demerouti et al., 2001) and reported instructor support to directly impact wellbeing along with PsyCap. Family support was also influential in a moderate capacity. In the current study it is proposed social support will be especially influential in those with low PsyCap levels, whereby low personal resources enhance the importance of external resources to cope with the demands they are faced with. This is due to the significant role that personal community plays in online learners (Borup et al., 2020; Oviatt, Graham, Davies, & Borup, 2018; Roksa & Kinsley, 2018).

It could be argued organisational or employer support is another influential support mechanism to DL students (many of whom work alongside their studies). This is because work is one core demand creating the potential for burnout and hampering engagement, and a more supportive employer may alter workloads to improve the study success of their employee. However not all students tell their employers they are studying. Whilst some are studying to further their current career (in some cases being sponsored by their employer), others are doing it for themselves and may not tell their employer they are studying at all. Due to this lack of consistency the present research will not look at the role of the employer, however we encourage future research to examine this.

In the present study, we propose that DL students higher in the composite PsyCap (therefore with higher hope, efficacy, resilience and optimism) will demonstrate lower levels of burnout and higher levels of engagement. This is because students with higher optimism and hope are likely to approach their studies with a positive outlook, from an engagement view this may mean engaging in the material with a positive attitude and seeking alternative ways of working and achieving their set goals, even when obstacles are in their way (e.g., engage to find new ways of studying to adapt to DL). This may include seeking help and advice from peers or teaching staff. Coupled with this those higher in self-efficacy may have the belief and drive to adapt to online learning, engage in discussion topics and trust in their ability to work remotely. Finally, those higher in resilience will be able to bounce back from setbacks and seek ways to achieve their goals going forward.

In relation to burnout, those higher in optimism and hope are likely to be more positive in their approach to studying and able to focus on their enjoyment as opposed to their exhaustion. They will also be able to adapt their pathways to achieve their goals rather than faltering in the face of challenges and giving up. Furthermore, those higher in self-efficacy will have the belief to maintain their effort and prevent them from disengaging and burning out. Finally, those higher in resilience will be able to fend off burnout and withstand periods where they feel low on energy.

We further propose that social support will be influential. In the context of burnout this will be through buffering the effects to moderate the relationship and in the context of engagement it will help enhance it. See Fig. 1 for the model to be examined.

2. Method
2.1. Participants and procedure
The study received ethical approval from a University in central England. The participants came from a single institution which runs undergraduate and postgraduate programmes through both face-to-face and online distance learning methods. All participants were from postgraduate online DL programmes with no campus involvement. Four hundred and sixty-five DL students aged 18-72 (M= 38.01, SD= 10.24) were recruited with 43% male, 56% female, 0.2% gender-neutral and 0.8% did not state. Participants were recruited via email advert, which indicated those interested should be working full-time alongside their part-time studies. Average work tenure of those participating was 7 years, with 32% having previous experience of studying via DL. All participants gave informed consent prior to taking part and confidentiality was maintained through students providing a unique code to protect their identity but enable them to withdraw their data within two weeks after completion should they wish. Participants accessed the online survey site via the advert. The survey began with items relating to age, gender, course, previous experience of DL and work tenure. Participants then answered questions relating to Psychological capital, engagement, burnout and social support.

2.2. Measures
Psychological Capital was measured on six-point scales (strongly disagree- strongly agree) using the 12-item short form measure (Luthans, Avolio, Avey, & Norman, 2007) which has been previously validated in academic contexts (e.g. Martinez, Meneghel, et al., 2019). The composite measure study alpha was 0.90. An example item for Hope is “Right now I see myself as being pretty successful on this course” (α =0.85), for efficacy “I feel confident contributing to discussions about the course” (α = 0.84), for resilience “I usually take stressful things on the course in stride (α =0.76) and for optimism “I always look on the bright side of things regarding my course” (α =0.85). High scores indicate high levels of PsyCap. Burnout was measured using items from Malach-Pines (2005) self-report measure of burnout on seven-point scales (never-always), where high scores indicate higher burnout. Responses were given to the question “When you think about your studies overall, how often do you feel the following”, 10 items were presented including tired, hopeless and trapped (α = 0.90). Engagement was assessed via Schaufeli and Bakker (2003) student work engagement scale on a seven-point scale (never-always), high scores indicate higher engagement. An example item is “I am enthusiastic about my studies” (α = 0.90). Social support was assessed via Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet, and Farley (1988) on a seven-point scale (very strongly disagree-very strongly agree). The scale measures perceptions of support from 3 sources: Family, friends, and a significant Other. Example items include “My friends really try to help me” and “I can talk about my problems with my family” (α =0.92). High scores indicate higher support.

2.3. Analyses
Prior to the analysis, the data was examined for normality and multi-collinearity to ensure the assumptions for running the moderation analysis were met. The outcome variables were centred. The observed model consisted of PsyCap as a predictor variable, social support as a moderator and burnout and engagement as outcome variables. Analysis proceeded in three stages: Firstly, we conducted a correlation to assess how the variables within the research related to one another. Secondly, we conducted hierarchical linear regressions. This involved entering control variables at step one (Gender, age, tenure at work) and PsyCap at step two. Thirdly, we conducted moderation analysis to establish the role of social support on the PsyCap-burnout and PsyCap-engagement relationships. All analyses were performed in SPSS version 26, with the moderation analysis utilising Hayes (2017) Process version 3.5.

3. Results
The main aim of this study was to examine the effects of PsyCap on postgraduate DL students’ burnout and engagement. Means, standard deviations and correlations amongst these variables are presented in Table 1. The table shows the sample to have relatively high levels of engagement and social support. Beyond this, mean burnout levels fell within the 2.5-3.4 range indicating risk of burnout (Malach-Pines, 2005). All the correlations were in the expected directions. The correlations show PsyCap to have a significant negative and positive association with burnout (r = -0.52, p<0.01) and engagement (r = 0.56, p<0.01) respectively, supporting hypotheses 1 and 2. Engagement had a significant negative association with burnout (r = -0.46, p <0.01) lending support to hypothesis 5.

The left-hand side of Table 2 shows the model to be significant in predicting burnout. Age (β= -0.11, p<0.05) and PsyCap (β= -0.50, p<0.001) were significant predictors of burnout. The model accounted for 27% of variance. This supports hypothesis 1 that PsyCap will negatively associate and predict student burnout.

The right-hand side of table 2 shows the model to be significant in predicting engagement. The final step shows PsyCap alone to be the significant predictor of engagement (β= 0.55, p<0.001). The model accounted for 32% of variance. This supports hypothesis 2 that PsyCap would positively associate and predict student engagement. In both models, the introduction of PsyCap led to a significant increase in the explanatory variance (R2 change = 0.24, p<0.001) for burnout and (R2 change = 0.29, p<0.001) for engagement respectively.

Following the significant role PsyCap was found to have in predicting student burnout and engagement; moderation analysis was conducted to establish whether social support moderated the relationship between PsyCap and burnout (PsyCap-burnout) and PsyCap and engagement (PsyCap-engagement) as hypothesised. Results showed social support did not significantly moderate the PsyCap-burnout relationship, therefore hypothesis 3 was rejected. However, it was found to moderate the PsyCap-engagement relationship (β = .08, 95% C.I. (.01, .15), p < .05) supporting hypothesis 4 and this is shown in Table 3, and Fig. 2 displays the slopes analysis.

Fig. 2. Slopes analysis of the moderation of social support on the PsyCap-engagement relationship.

Table 3 shows a significant interaction effect on the relationship. Figure 2 demonstrates that when perceived social support is low and PsyCap is low then engagement levels are lower. Whereas if the individual has high PsyCap, engagement remains higher irrespective of the low support experienced. Furthermore, when perceived support is high this effect is replicated but with the slope being less steep. This shows when an individual has low PsyCap social support takes on increased importance, whereby high support can increase student engagement. This is in line with hypothesis 4.

4. Discussion
The main aim of this study was to examine the effects of PsyCap on postgraduate DL students’ burnout and engagement. In addition, it was examined whether social support acts as a moderator on these variables. The present research found that PsyCap significantly predicts burnout and engagement in postgraduate DL students supporting hypotheses 1 and 2. Furthermore, social support was found to moderate the PsyCap-engagement relationship indicating high levels of social support could buffer the effects of low PsyCap levels. This lends support to hypothesis 4. Beyond this, burnout was found to negatively associate with engagement in line with hypothesis 5. However social support was not found to moderate the PsyCap-burnout relationship as expected and therefore hypothesis 3 is rejected.

The finding of PsyCap negatively relating and predicting burnout fully supported previous research findings (Chang et al., 2000; Luthans et al., 2004; Valentine et al., 2004). Our results suggest that DL students who have a more positive psychological state of development are less likely to experience burnout. More specifically this relates to the combined effects of the PsyCap components of hope, efficacy, resilience and optimism. Those who are more positive in their approach, have the belief to put in the required effort to succeed, persevere towards their academic goals, and are able to overcome any setbacks they are faced with are in turn better equipped to be less susceptible to burnout. This finding is one of the key contributions to both literature and practice through identifying those distance learners susceptible to burnout based on their individual differences.

This evidence can be strongly supported by the job-demands resource model (JD-R; Bakker & Demerouti, 2007) illustrating those with higher levels of PsyCap possess higher levels of internal resources from which to counteract the effects of the dual demands they are experiencing via full-time work alongside studying. This also ties in with the depletion model (see Creed et al., 2015) that states we have set psychological and physical resources, and that when expending these in one role it reduces those available for another. The findings would suggest full-time work is leaving insufficient resources available for individuals with low PsyCap for studying, leading them to experience burnout. However, those with higher PsyCap resources are able to overcome this.

Higher PsyCap levels predicting lower burnout is an especially important finding given the developmental capacities of PsyCap (Luthans et al., 2006; Luthans et al., 2010; Luthans et al., 2014). Research by Luthans et al. (2014) demonstrated how a one-off two-hour intervention targeted at the four components of PsyCap in undergraduate students, led to significant pre-post enhancement to PsyCap levels. It also showed significant enhancement when compared to a control group receiving a non-PsyCap focussed session. This indicates that short- and long-term interventions could be developed and implemented to enhance student PsyCap. The implication being helping to reduce burnout and related non-desirable outcomes in DL students.

PsyCap predicting learners’ engagement supports previous research (Luthans et al., 2016; Martinez, Youseff-Morgan, et al., 2019; Siu et al., 2014; Won You, 2016), and this finding is extended to the newly explored postgraduate DL population. Given the dual demand of full-time work alongside part-time study, this is an important replication of established associations. This shows those with higher psychological resources will report higher engagement with their studies. Engagement is a desirable construct in academia, with links to academic grades, achievement, persistence, learner satisfaction and performance (e.g., Carini et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2008; Fredricks et al., 2004; Ketonen et al., 2019; Schaufeli, Martínez, et al., 2002). DL students who have to balance dual demands need to be able to adapt and redirect their plans as these fluctuate (hope), be resilient to setbacks (resilient), and have a positive belief they can succeed (optimism and efficacy). The present study shows those who possess the resources to do this will be more engaged in their studies.

As with burnout the findings can be contextualised by theory in line with the JD-R model, whereby those with higher resources are better equipped to overcome the demands they face and have higher engagement levels. This provides further evidence to support the need to look at implementing PsyCap development interventions for DL students to ensure they maximise their potential in their studies whilst also safeguarding their wellbeing from burnout.

Social support was found to impact engagement in DL students by enhancing levels for those lower in PsyCap, i.e., those students who have low self-belief, possess less ability to persevere and redirect plans to achieve their goals, and having greater difficulty to bounce back from setbacks. The finding suggests that those with a lower psychological state of development, benefit from perceiving they have strong social support. This may be because DL student social support networks positively impact their ability to cope with university demands and in turn develop greater educational engagement (Alarcon et al., 2011; Ouweneel et al., 2011). Therefore, in the presence of low personal resources (PsyCap), external resources (social support) play a vital role in engagement. It is surprising therefore that the role of social support was not replicated in relation to burnout, which is contrary to previous works (Bolger & Amarel, 2007; Halbesleben, 2006; Nielsen et al., 2017). This could however be explained by Halbesleben (2006) who examined social support as a resource in relation to burnout and found the source of the social support (work vs. nonwork) impacted on the moderation effects. Indicating it might be a specific type of support that is influential with respect to burnout. The present research examined support of family, friends and significant others, and in doing so falls in line with Borup et al. (2020) definition of personal community sources of social support. Future research could examine the role of different types of social support, such as course community support (Borup et al., 2020), in more depth than was possible here to identify whether the effects differ. Hence, our findings further contribute to previous literature (Newman et al., 2014) by identifying social support as a moderator of PsyCap-Engagement. However, the current study suggests the role of the moderator will vary in significance depending on the outcome variable of interest.

A key implication of this research is to identify postgraduate DL students who are more susceptible to burnout when working alongside their studies. This study provides an opportunity to design strategies and interventions to support these individuals. One way is by enhancing PsyCap levels through developmental interventions akin to the one-off two-hour session of Luthans et al. (2014) (see also Luthans et al., 2006; Luthans et al., 2010) as this would reduce the burnout experienced, whilst providing the dual benefit of enhancing engagement in line with this study’s findings. Therefore, the benefits of enhancing the PsyCap of DL students is twofold: lower burnout and higher engagement. However, interventions should involve longitudinal assessment to observe the positive impact of PsyCap on student academic engagement and on negative outcomes like burnout (Datu & Valdez, 2016).

Another strategy could be the pre-screening of applicants during the admissions process. This would enable identification of those individuals who are lower in PsyCap, and therefore are at a higher risk of burnout and lower engagement. This would enable early intervention to support those students in their studies. Higher education institutions could look to develop PsyCap intervention sessions which could be implemented during induction and welcome weeks for students in order to enhance their PsyCap levels. This would be beneficial for individuals undertaking this mode of learning. Having lower levels of burnout and more engaged students would also be beneficial for higher education institutes more broadly.

Further to this, course instructors could also help contribute to the development of PsyCap. For example, to strengthen self-efficacy instructors could verbally provide constructive feedback, and to increase hope they could help with goal setting, which would help create paths to the individual’s goals. This would further contribute to developing an optimistic attitude towards succeeding, and the support offered has potential to help develop student resilience. A further implication could be the embedding of developmental tasks that aim to develop the four PsyCap dimensions throughout the academic programme. This would be especially effective for courses that are multiple years in length where the benefits can be carried forward into subsequent years of study. However, this longitudinal approach may be less effectful for shorter courses. Developed measures of PsyCap could be used by universities and teaching staff to assess and track student PsyCap development throughout the programme (Luthans, Avolio, et al., 2007; Martinez, Meneghel, et al., 2019; Siu et al., 2014).

Social support enhancing engagement levels is also an important finding. It demonstrates the importance of a perceived support network for DL students. Many of whom are balancing the dual demands of work and study in a remote location away from the physical support networks universities can offer. More specifically our findings indicate that social support from friends, family and significant others (e.g., partner) improves the relationship between PsyCap and academic engagement in distance learners. Therefore, to promote social support the following practical measures could be taken. It could be suggested to students that they ask family members to assist them by taking on extra household responsibilities on their behalf (e.g., household chores, childcare, wider family and community commitments) (Aryee, Luk, Leung, & Lo, 1999). In line with this additional support could be provided to them around assignment deadlines. Other practical recommendations that family, friends or significant others could implement include helping to arrange a quieter study place, providing support and encouragement throughout the individual’s studies (especially when things may be challenging or not going as hoped), looking to organise and celebrate minor successes to increase efficacy, or by reminding them to seek help from their tutors when needed (Simpson, 2000). These strategies would help to increase the perceived social support of the individual. These recommendations could be suggested to learners as part of a study skills session during induction. This would make them aware of these benefits ahead of commencing studying, maximising the potential benefits it can have. This is especially important for a largely independent, asynchronous mode of learning. Additionally, as part of induction, posters could be created and shared by the institution’s admission team detailing to students ways their personal community can support them during their studies.

Looking to implement strategies such as peer networking, effective onboarding, and developing a sense of community amongst learners (e.g., through setting cross-peer working tasks) is a proactive way to try to further develop friendships within their cohort. This in turn links to the development of a core source of social support (friends) examined within the social support construct within this research. This will help to enhance the support one perceives they have (by developing their personal community through friendships). This is an external resource that can be proactively influenced to mitigate against low PsyCap (internal) resources. This does however overlap to a degree with course community support (Borup et al., 2020), which is another branch of support and a strategy that could be investigated further in future research. This type of community support was not examined within this research and could partly explain the conflicting role support was found to have between engagement and burnout. It may be that the support of friends, family or a significant other is significant in encouraging and enhancing engagement, whereas it is the support of peers, tutors and the institution that can have an influence on burnout. It indicates that it may be that depending on the outcome of interest, depends on the source of support that individuals benefit from. For example, if course content is the source of stress and burnout, then it might be the course community that is be better placed to offer support, opposed to one’s personal community (Borup et al., 2020). This was not captured in the present study but does offer an avenue for future research. Creating the perception of a strong support network can also result in other beneficial outcomes such as increased motivation (Dupont, Galand, & Nils, 2015).

We acknowledge several limitations to the work. Firstly, the cross-sectional nature makes it hard to fully establish cause and effect relationships. Secondly, although from distinct areas of study all students resided within the same university. Thirdly, the inclusion of retention rates would have provided a further dimension to examine beyond burnout. Fourthly, due to participants responding to an email alert we cannot report a response rate. Finally, the research was conducted within the Covid-19 pandemic and therefore burnout and engagement levels may have been impacted by this. However, in the future, a similar model could be tested on a larger scale by involving DL students from a variety of higher education institutes from around the world. Future work should also look to replicate the effects established here longitudinally and consider wider sources of support (such as community). A strength of the present study is it has examined a unique population in postgraduate distance learners who work full-time alongside their studies. In doing so it has enabled identification of the influential role PsyCap has on two important academic factors of burnout and engagement. Finally, it is the first study of its kind to test the proposed model involving social support.

5. Conclusions
In conclusion, we found that PsyCap predicts burnout and engagement in distance learning students. Furthermore, social support was identified as a significant moderator to enhance engagement levels in those with lower PsyCap. Implications of this research are that an individual’s PsyCap should be considered by higher education institutes, and methods offered to develop and enhance it.
