As they transition from a face-to-face to an online learning environment, online students are likely to feel anxious about their ability to succeed in what could be an unfamiliar learning environment. To ease this transition, online learning orientations are intended to defuse students' feelings of anxiety by clarifying course expectations and requirements while boosting their self-confidence and preparedness. This study examined how various factors associated with the online learning experience – students' demographics, prior online learning experience, satisfaction, and sense of preparedness for the course after completing an online learning orientation – influence online students' feelings of anxiety. Using a binary logistic regression, our findings confirmed that demographics (i.e., female, full-time, first-year online student), prior online learning experience, and sense of preparedness predicted online students' feelings of anxiety. Student age and student satisfaction were less conclusive. Overall, our study reiterates the need to address factors associated with online students' feelings of anxiety, in order to boost their confidence, motivation, and preparedness to succeed in online courses.

Faced with an unfamiliar learning space, online students are often pressed to unlearn longstanding learning habits and to engage in new ways of learning. Using a learning management system, online students interact with their instructor and peers while engaging with the course content and the assignments at their own time, pace, and space. As this transition from a face-to-face to an online learning environment unfolds, online students are likely to feel anxious about their ability to succeed in an unfamiliar learning environment. Without a clear course roadmap and orientation on where to start and what to do, inexperienced online students are prone to feel anxious, particularly if one considers that online students are predominantly non-traditional students who are juggling family, work, and study (Zembylas, 2008). This sense of unease and apprehension is often exacerbated by students' lack of academic and technical skills, and by feelings of isolation and writing anxiety (Müller, 2008; Zembylas, 2008). Online students are often apprehensive about communicating their ideas in writing (Autman & Kelly, 2017). Furthermore, past studies show that online students are more anxious than traditional students in courses deemed complexes, such as Statistics and Research Methods (DeVaney, 2010; Hedges, 2017; Rapp-McCall & Anyikwa, 2016). Negative emotions and beliefs appear to form a significant roadblock to online students' academic persistence and success (Tempelaar, Niculescu, Rienties, Gijselaers, & Giesbers, 2012), especially at the beginning of the course (DeVaney, 2010; Zembylas, 2008).

To lessen these feelings of anxiety among online students, higher education institutions (HEIs) are increasingly offering self-paced Online Learning Orientations (OLOs) as a proactive support strategy. Intended to ease students' transition into online learning, OLOs clarify course expectations and requirements while building students' self-confidence and preparedness (Bawa, 2016; Clay, Rowland, & Packard, 2008; Gilmore & Lyons, 2012; Russo-Gleicher, 2014). By offering an early positive encounter with the online learning environment, use of an OLO can allay online students' anxiety, even as it increases their confidence and readiness to learn online (Gilmore & Lyons, 2012; Kanuka & Jugdev, 2006; Motteram & Forrester, 2005; Vaill, 2014).

Given the interaction of beliefs, emotions, and achievement in student learning (Linnenbrink, 2006; Marchand & Gutierrez, 2012) and the role played by prior online learning experience in students' success (Hachey, Wladis, & Conway, 2014), the need to examine the interplay of online students' feelings of anxiety with their level of preparedness is critical. As one of the strongest emotional predictors of success in online learning, anxiety plays an influential role in online students' success and retention (Berenson, Boyles, & Weaver, 2008). Hence, exploring the influence of an OLO on students' feelings of anxiety is likely to support institutional efforts to bolster students' retention and, ultimately, their success.

However, despite the importance of student preparedness in reducing their feelings of anxiety, none of the reviewed studies examined the influence of OLO on online students' feelings of anxiety. To fill this gap, this paper examines the influence of several variables – students' demographic factors, their prior online learning experience, their satisfaction with the completion of online learning, and their sense of preparedness after completing an online learning orientation – on their feelings of anxiety.

This paper is divided into five sections. First, we review the theoretical framework underpinning this study. Second, we conduct a thorough analysis of the influence of anxiety on students' motivation and performance, and we follow this by a review of numerous studies on the influence of an OLO on students' performance. Third, we clarify the purpose of our study. Fourth, we describe the context of our study and our methodological approach. Fifth, we outline our statistical analysis protocol, and we present and discuss our findings. We conclude by a) discussing the limits of our study and b) offering few recommendations and concluding remarks.

1. Theoretical framework
Informed by Bandura's social cognitive theory, this study is framed around the interplay of self-efficacy and anxiety. Defined as belief in one's capacity to perform tasks successfully (Bandura, 1977), self-efficacy is closely related to anxiety. As a result, the lack of confidence in one's ability to complete specific tasks is a potential source of anxiety, especially for online students. To this end, Wäschle, Allgaier, Lachner, Fink, and Nückles (2014) argued that an increase in academic self-efficacy (ASE) has a positive impact on students' motivation to tackle new tasks. Students' self-confidence to complete tasks will enhance their self-efficacy, which in turn will increase their motivation and will reduce their feelings of anxiety. In contrast, a low ASE is associated with negative emotions, such as anxiety, and with lower performance (Marchand & Gutierrez, 2012). By influencing students' judgment about their own ability to succeed, ASE predicts and mediates students' achievement, motivation, and learning (Elias & MacDonald, 2007; Shea & Bidjerano, 2010; van Dinther, Dochy, & Segers, 2011). Students with a higher level of academic self-efficacy are more motivated to perform well academically than those with a lower level of academic self-efficacy. Likewise, Shen, Cho, Tsai, and Marra (2013) found that, as a multidimensional construct, students' self-efficacy and confidence to complete an online course predicted their overall online learning satisfaction. Therefore, ASE is a powerful construct capable of exerting a considerable influence on students' motivation, as well as on their willingness to learn, to persist, and to succeed. Understanding the interaction of an OLO with an online students' feelings of anxiety can inform and guide support efforts aiming to boost their confidence, motivation, and success.

2. Review of the literature
2.1. Online learning anxiety
Students' anxiety, or their short-term worry triggered by uncertainty, is inversely correlated with their learning effectiveness. Since they impede students' disposition to learn online (Marchand & Gutierrez, 2012), feelings of anxiety influence students' motivation and self-efficacy, while decreasing their self-regulated learning strategies and emotional engagement (Sun & Rueda, 2012). Ranging in format from disciplinary anxiety (in disciplines such as Statistics, Research Methods, and Foreign Languages) to computer and online learning anxiety, students' anxiety can often be attributed to a variety of factors, including a lack of clear instructions and/or feedback from the instructor, inability to manage the course workload, feelings of isolation, a lack of self-confidence, and negative past experiences (Bates & Khasawneh, 2007; Conrad, 2002; Motteram & Forrester, 2005; Piccoli, Ahmad, & Ives, 2001; Saadé, Kira, & Nebebe, 2013). Unprepared online students, especially those with a low computer confidence, often display a distinctive level of online learning anxiety. In contrast, online students with high computer confidence are likely to thrive, since they do not foresee a negative online learning experience. Much like their students, unprepared and inexperienced online faculty can exhibit feelings of fear and anxiety. These can influence their self-efficacy and their ability, both to teach and to develop robust online courses (Kidd, 2017; Kidd, Davis, & Larke, 2012).

Moreover, past studies have underlined the prevalence of a feeling of anxiety among online students at the beginning of courses. DeVaney (2010) reported that online students taking statistics courses express a high level of anxiety, particularly at the beginning of the course. These results were corroborated by Zembylas (2008) and by Bolliger and Halupa (2012), who reported that online students' anxiety levels decrease as the course unfolds. For their part, Sun, Tsai, Finger, Chen, and Yeh (2008) concluded that learner computer anxiety is one of the seven variables that influence online learners' satisfaction. In the same way, Bates and Khasawneh (2007) found anxiety to be one of the predictors of online learning self-efficacy. The other predictors included prior online learning success, instructor feedback, and pre-course training.

These conclusions underscore the importance of using an online learning orientation as a proactive strategy, both to engage students early and to lessen their feelings of anxiety. Helping students to navigate the unfamiliar terrain of online courses safely is expected to defuse their feelings of anxiety and to foster their success and retention. In the next section, we will examine the influence of the use of an online learning orientation on students' overall academic achievement and persistence.

2.2. Online learning orientation
Use of an online learning orientation is widely viewed as one of the most effective proactive strategies for easing students' transition into online learning, while fostering their readiness. Used as a readiness assessment of students' skills and knowledge, OLOs are intended to clarify course requirements and processes (McGee, Valdes, & Bullis, 2016). Having said this, let us examine more carefully how an OLO can influence students' preparedness and retention, and ultimately, their success.

As a preparedness tool, Bozarth, Chapman, and LaMonica (2004) proposed that all online students complete a mandatory one-credit orientation. To ease students' transition, reduce their misconceptions, and increase their chances of success, the authors proposed an orientation that is focused on developing students' attitudes, technical skills, knowledge, and (such as time management and personal commitment). In the same vein, Bawa (2016) recommended that an online orientation be made mandatory for all online students. However, the researcher cautions against imposing the orientation on overconfident students, who might perceive this requirement as an unwarranted exercise. Instead, Bawa (2016) encouraged institutions to explore alternative enforcement strategies, even as they invite instructors both to reflect upon and to update their own technological and facilitation skills. For their part, Wozniak, Pizzica, and Mahony (2012) suggested finding creative ways to engage students throughout the semester, while keeping the interplay of the technological, interpersonal, and reflective dimensions that underpin the online student learning journey in perspective. This approach – one of extending the orientation throughout the semester – is beneficial for students new to online learning, students who are often pressed to digest a vast amount of information at the beginning of the semester (Smyth & Lodge, 2012).

As a retention strategy, completion of an OLO increases students' likelihood to persist by reducing their confusion and by addressing their misconceptions early in the process (Morris & Finnegan, 2008; Smyth & Lodge, 2012). To this end, Russo-Gleicher (2014) recommended the inclusion of an online orientation as a powerful retention strategy, offered alongside the screening of students and the support and empowerment of the faculty. Using qualitative data from semi-structured, in-depth faculty interviews, Russo-Gleicher (2014) suggested using a mandatory orientation not only to clarify students' online learning misconceptions but also to provide a realistic purview of course expectations, as well as to discuss time management skills.

As a success strategy, Hachey et al. (2014) contended that offering targeted support to students taking their first online course is a critical factor in their success in future online courses. Wojciechowski and Palmer (2005) identified orientation completion as the “second greatest factor,” following a student's Grade Point Average (GPA), in predicting his or her success in an online course. Altogether, as reported by Cho (2012) and by Lee and Choi (2011), the completion of an online orientation increases online students' persistence. However, to soften this conclusion, we must note, along with Dray, Lowenthal, Miszkiewicz, Ruiz-Primo, and Marczynski (2011), that students' success in online programs hinges partially on the complex mesh of their learner characteristics and their level of engagement with the technology.

In summary, the use of an online learning orientation increases the likelihood of students' persistence and success by clarifying, early on, their course expectations and requirements, by dispelling their misconceptions, and by easing their transition into online learning. By enabling students to develop online study skills and by building their confidence, an online learning orientation is likely to reduce their feelings of anxiety and to help them to progress successfully.

Having looked at the some of the benefits of an OLO on fostering online students' readiness and success, let us turn our attention to the impact of prior online learning experience on students' feelings of anxiety.

2.3. Prior online learning experience
Inexperienced online students are likely to use more effective learning strategies, which in turn can lead to a higher level of motivation and better grades (Wang, Shannon, & Ross, 2013). Indeed, Hachey et al. (2014) found that prior online experience is strongly correlated with students' success and retention, regardless of their GPA. Later, Hachey, Wladis, and Conway (2015) concluded that prior online experience predicted subsequent online courses outcomes, even after controlling for GPA. After reviewing 26 online learning orientation programs, Scheitler (2015) showed that participation in online programs boosted students' self-efficacy for online courses. By improving the skills and attributes needed for online learning, online students gain self-confidence – a confidence that transforms their disposition towards online learning.

By and large, self-confidence and the belief in one's ability to succeed are critical in self-regulating online learning study habits. In addition to influencing students' cognitive processes and actions, academic self-efficacy fuels students' motivation and ability to succeed while reducing their feelings of anxiety. In this respect, an online learning orientation plays a critical role in defusing students' feelings of anxiety. Thus, we argue for the need to further explore the influence of an online learning orientation on students' feelings of anxiety. In the next two sections, we discuss the purpose and the research questions examined in this study, followed by the methodological approach used to address these questions.

3. Purpose of the study
As shown in the literature review, past studies have presented ample evidence that students completing an OLO are less prone to be anxious, which, in turn, improves their persistence and performance. By increasing students' preparedness to complete online courses, an online learning orientation may reduce students' (particularly new online students') frustrations and apprehensions.

Taking into account evidence from the literature, this study examines the influence of several variables – student demographics (gender, age, academic year, and enrollment status), their prior online learning experience (number of courses taken before), their satisfaction with taking an online learning orientation, and their sense of preparedness to take an online course after completing the orientation – on their feelings of anxiety. More specifically, we attempt to answer the following research questions (RQ):

RQ1.
How do students' demographics (gender, age, academic year, and enrollment status) influence their feelings of anxiety?

RQ2.
How does the number of online courses taken before (students' prior online learning experience) influence their feelings of anxiety?

RQ3.
How does students' satisfaction with the online learning orientation influence their feelings of anxiety?

RQ4.
How does students' sense of preparedness, after completing the online learning orientation, influence their feelings of anxiety?

In agreement with past research, we anticipate that students' demographics are likely to be predictive of their feelings of anxiety. More specifically, we expect that female students are more prone to feel anxious than male students. Similarly, we believe that younger students are more disposed to feel anxious than older students. Likewise, freshmen (first-year students) are more likely to be anxious than junior and senior students. As for enrollment status, full-time students are more inclined to feel anxious than part-time students.

Second, we foresee that a student's prior experience with online learning, measured by the number of online courses taken previously, will be positively related to his or her feelings of anxiety. Third, we expect that a student's satisfaction with the online learning orientation will be positively associated with his or her feelings of anxiety. Fourth, we anticipate that a student's sense of preparedness to take online courses will predict his or her feelings of anxiety. A higher level of preparedness will yield a lower feeling of anxiety.

By conducting this study, we aim to accomplish three goals: 1) to better understand several factors associated with online students' feelings of anxiety; 2) to explore ways to boost students' preparedness and readiness to ease their feelings of anxiety; and 3) to reiterate the role of an online learning orientation in easing students' transition into online learning. We attempt to show that the inclusion of a customized online learning orientation, as part of comprehensive student support approach, is an effective proactive strategy in reducing online students' feelings of anxiety. Altogether, in addition to filling the literature gap about the role of OLO in defusing online students' anxiety, the added value of this study lays into unpacking the demographic factors influencing their feelings of anxiety. Unlike past studies, our large sample spanning across multiple semesters (three semesters, 358 courses and 4333 students) is likely to yield stronger findings.

In the next section, we discuss the background of our study followed by our research instrument.

4. Method
4.1. Background
This study was conducted in a moderate-sized, urban, public university that has been involved in distance learning since the mid-1980s. During the academic year of 2016–2017, >1300 courses were offered in an online format. Of these courses, 28% were offered through its Personal Learning Environment (PLE), a proprietary learning management system designed to provide a student-centered learning environment. PLE courses are developed following a team-based approach that involves the collaboration of several specialists (subject matter, instructional, and technical). Using various templates and rubrics, course designers follow an iterative quality assurance design process (Abdous, 2009, Abdous, 2011).

Recognizing the need to engage online students early their coursework, we developed an online learning orientation to enhance students' readiness and confidence in taking online courses. Designed and positioned as the first assignment and embedded as a part of each course offered via the PLE, the OLO was created to ease students' transitions into becoming self-directed learners by clarifying both course expectations and their roles and responsibilities as online learners. To this end, the orientation offers students multiple opportunities to (1) acquire online study and time management skills; (2) familiarize themselves with the learning environment (both PLE and Blackboard); (3) assess their computer and technology skills in a risk-free environment, and (4) learn how to seek help and to access resources, all while reflecting on their online learning readiness. Additionally, the orientation raised many of the misconceptions associated with online courses, such as easiness, lower faculty expectations, and lower time requirements (Li & Akins, 2005; Mortagy & Boghikian-Whitby, 2010).

4.2. Instrument
4.2.1. Dependent variable
Our survey included one single-item measurement for the dependent variable (feelings of anxiety): Has taking an online course increased your feelings of anxiety? According to Fuchs and Diamantopoulos (2009), single-item measurement use is a widespread practice in the psychological and social sciences. Davey, Barratt, Butow, and Deeks (2007) concluded that a one-item question can adequately measure anxiety. Similarly, Núñez-Peña, Guilera, and Suárez-Pellicioni (2014) found that measuring math anxiety with a single-item showed evidence of “validity and strong test-retest reliability.”

To better understand the factors associated with their feelings of anxiety, we asked students to select from a multiple response list of the common triggers of online learning anxiety (see Fig. 2), with an option to add “other” factors of anxiety. This list was gathered from a number of studies about traditional online learning roadblocks (Ali, Uppal, & Gulliver, 2017; Bolliger & Halupa, 2012; Lehman & Conceição, 2014; Motteram & Forrester, 2005).

4.2.2. Independent variables
For the independent variables, our survey included the following questions:

1.
Demographic information about gender (i.e., male and female), age (i.e., ≤21, 22–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, & ≥65), academic year (i.e., freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, or graduate), and enrollment status (i.e., full-time, part-time)

2.
Online learning experience: Number of online courses taken before, with the options of 0, 1–5, 6–10, and >10

3.
Satisfaction with the online learning orientation: How useful, comprehensive, and worthy of their time they deemed the orientation to be; how satisfied with it they were; what worked best and least; and how the orientation could be improved

4.
Sense of preparedness after completing the online learning orientation: whether students felt more prepared, clearer about expectations, less isolated, more confident to keep up with course assignments

5.
To ensure our survey validity, we adapted the questions from previously validated surveys for measuring preparedness and satisfaction (Dray et al., 2011; Holder, 2007; Parkes, Stein, & Reading, 2015). In addition to this methodological step, we requested feedback from a peer group of professional educators heavily involved in designing, facilitating, and supporting online courses. Their feedback cross-validated our survey and led to some minor tweaking of the survey questions.

6.
To measure the items' homogeneity of student satisfaction and students' sense of preparedness scales, we conducted an internal consistency analysis. For the student satisfaction with the online learning orientation (5 items with a one-to-five Likert scale), Cronbach's alpha value was very high (0.952). For the students' sense of preparedness (six items with a one-to-five Likert scale), the coefficient is very high, as well (0.933). These coefficients confirm the reliability of our survey questions.

5. Data analysis
All the data analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics 25. The alpha level was set at 0.05 in all significance tests. For open-ended questions, QDA Miner 5, a qualitative data analysis tool, was used to identify the most frequent words used by the students. To analyze the data, we first conducted a descriptive analysis to describe the demographic profile of the respondents, followed by a multiple response frequencies to characterize the factors associated with anxiety. Second, we used cross tabulation to explore the interaction of our dependent variable with various independent variables. Third, we conducted a binary logistic regression to examine the influence of each predictor on its own, followed by a full model including only significant predictors.

5.1. Participants
Between Fall 2016 and Summer 2017, 4333 students from six different colleges at the same university completed a survey about a) their satisfaction with the completion of their online learning orientation, and b) their sense of preparedness and feelings of anxiety. Of this diverse population, 4117 cases with complete data were included in our analysis. Among these respondents, there were more female students (n = 2704, 66.6%) than male students. Half of them were between 22 and 34 years of age (n = 2079, 51%), self-identified as traditional part-time college students (n = 2157, 53.4%). 45% of the students reported having taken 1 to 5 prior online courses (n = 1835), while 16% (n = 660) of the respondents reported that they had never taken an online course before this one. As to their academic year, participants were typically seniors (n = 1668, 41%), followed by juniors (n = 1245, 30.6%), and then graduates (n = 477, 11.7%). More detailed background information is presented in Table 1.

6.1. Descriptive statistics
As shown in Table 2, with a 4.09 mean on a 5-point Likert scale, participants expressed a high level of satisfaction with the OLO. The open-ended questions related to students' satisfaction reinforced this conclusion as well. Students expressed their satisfaction with the OLO content's helpfulness, ease, visual layout, and use of video content. Some of the most frequent words used included “video content” (864, 9.4%), “helpful” (198, 2.15%), and “easy” (195, 2.12%).

Likewise, students expressed a high level of preparedness to take online courses. On a 5-point Likert scale, the mean was (M = 3.98/5). Students felt that the online learning orientation prepared them to complete their online courses. This self-confidence was reflected in the open-ended questions' comments as well. Students reaffirmed their readiness to complete their online courses, after completing the OLO.

To complete this descriptive analysis section, students were asked to identify various factors triggering their feelings of anxiety. As shown in Fig. 2 below, more than half of the student population (n = 2127, 60.3%) placed the lack of clear guidelines at the top of their worry list, followed by technical difficulties (n = 1789, 50.9%) and lack of face-to-face time with faculty (n = 1791, 50.7%). Interestingly, the lack of interaction with classmates as a potential cause of anxiety represented 23.1% of all cases. Furthermore, anxious students identified technical difficulties (63.6% of all cases) followed by the risk of online distraction (59.7%), lack of feedback from faculty (58.4%), and lack of clear guidelines and explanations (56.5%) as possible sources of anxiety. The remaining factors were equally listed by anxious and non-anxious students.

These results were slightly cross-validated by students' responses to the open-ended questions in the survey. The most common reasons given by students for feelings anxious included poor time management skills, course workload, group work, technical difficulties, and fear of missing assignments.

6.2. Contingency tables
To provide initial insights into our data, we conducted a 2 × 2 contingency table analysis to look for associations between the feelings of anxiety and the explanatory variables: gender, age, academic year, enrollment status, prior online learning experience, satisfaction with the online learning orientation, and sense of preparedness to complete an online course.

As we examine Table 3, we note several interesting points. In terms of gender, of the 36.9% (1451) of online students who report themselves as anxious, 70.6% (1025) are female. However, within the female student subgroup, 39.1% report being anxious, compared to 32.5% of the male students. Overall, 70.64% of the anxious online students are female; this proportion is higher than the global female student population (65.7%). The feelings of anxiety fluctuate among age groups, between 39.7% for those 21 and under, 37.5% for those 22 to 34 years old, and 45.5% for those 65 and over. Reporting the least anxiety is age group 45 to 54 with 31.6%, followed by age group 34 to 44 with 31.9%. If we consider the number of students per age group, we observe that 76.7% of the anxious students belong to the first two age groups (21 and under and 22 to 34).

As to the students' academic year, of the 49.2% of anxious students, first-year students are far more anxious than the rest of the groups. Junior students (37.7%), senior students (36.6%), and graduate students (36.6%) have nearly the same percentages of anxious students. Sophomore students are the lowest reported anxious group, with 33.2%. In the same way, the percentage of full-time students (50.1%) is almost identical to that of part-time students (49.8%). If we factor in the total number of students per subgroup, the number of part-time students increases by 5.2% (65.7% for part-time online students versus 60.72% for full-time students). Unsurprisingly, with 51.5%, inexperienced online students (those who have taken no online courses) are the largest anxious group. In contrast, only 22.4% of the students who had taken more than ten courses felt anxious. Between these two groups, 40.2% of students who had completed one to five courses were anxious, followed by students who had completed between six and ten courses (33.6%).

Finally, as predicted, only 1.1% (16) of anxious students reported that they were strongly dissatisfied with the online learning orientation. In contrast, 18% (265) of strongly satisfied students were anxious. Between these two groups, 48.4% (712) of anxious students were satisfied, whereas 29.4% (432) were neutral. In the same manner, only 1.0% (14) of anxious students felt strongly unprepared to take an online course after completing the online learning orientation. In contrast, 17% (250) of the strongly prepared students were anxious. Between these two groups, 46.4% (676) of the anxious students felt prepared, whereas 31.3% (460) were neutral.

In summary, both a descriptive analysis and the two-way tables show a strong relationship between the feelings of anxiety and the various explanatory variables. In the next section, we use binary logistic regression to examine more closely the association between feelings of anxiety and the five potential predictors.

6.3. Binary logistic regression analysis
Using binary logistic regression, we examined the relationship between the feelings of anxiety (the dependent variable) and the following covariates: gender, age, academic year, enrollment status, prior online learning experience, satisfaction with online learning orientation, and sense of preparedness to complete an online course. More specifically, we modeled the effect of each predictor separately, then included all the predictors in one model.

Binary logistic regression is deemed suitable for dichotomous dependent variables and categorical predictors (Cohen, Cohen, West, & Aiken, 2003; Norusis, 2008; Peng, So, Stage, & St. John, 2002). For regression models with a categorical independent variable, we used dummy coding to recode the categorical predictor data so that the regression coefficient(s) of the newly created dummy variable(s) would be meaningful, between-group differences (Cohen et al., 2003).

6.3.1. Dummy coding
In regression models with categorical independent variables (i.e., gender, age, academic year, enrollment status, and prior online learning experience), the following groups – male students, 21 years old and younger, freshmen, full-time students, and no previous online experience – were used as the reference groups. In our research assumptions, these subgroups were likely to express a high level of anxiety.

6.3.2. Unadjusted effect of predictors
To examine the unadjusted effect of each predictor, we began by including one single explanatory variable at a time into the model (Landau & Everitt, 2004). For the sake of brevity, the individual models are summarized in Table 4.

As reported in Table 4, the influence of gender on students' feelings of anxiety was significant (OR = 1.333, p < .000). When compared to online male students, the odds of feeling anxious were 33% higher for online female students. In contrast, when compared to the age group “21 and Under”, the effect of age was not significant. Except for the age group 35 to 44 (OR = 0.712, p < .003) and the age group 45 to 54 (OR = 0.702, p < .015), the rest of the groups were significantly different from that of the reference group “21 and Under.” The odds of feeling anxious decreased by 29% for students aged between 35 and 44 years (OR = 0.712).

For the academic year, results indicated that sophomore students (OR = 0.514, p < .002), junior students (OR = 0.624, p < .013), senior students (OR = 0.590, p < .005), and graduate students (OR = 0595, p < .011), were less likely to feel anxious when compared to first-year students. The odds of feeling anxious were 38% lower for junior students, followed by 41% for graduate and senior students and 49% for sophomore students.

The influence of the students' enrollment status was very significant as well (OR = 1.264, p < .000). Using full-time students as a reference, the odds of feeling anxious decreased by 26% for part-time students. Hence, full-time students were more prone to feel anxious than their part-time counterparts.

Similarly, our data suggested a strong influence of the amount of online learning experience on students' feelings of anxiety (OR = 0.498, p < .000). Inexperienced online students were 51% more likely to feel anxious than experienced online students. When disaggregated, the odds of feeling anxious among inexperienced students decreased with the number of online courses taken by the student. Students who had taken one to five online courses were 37% less likely to feel anxious (OR = 0.634, p < .000). In contrast, students who had completed more than ten online courses were 73% less likely to feel anxious (OR = 0.272, p < .000) than inexperienced online students.

Regarding the influence of students' satisfaction with the OLO, the odds ratio for any one unit's increase in “satisfaction” was given by OR = 0.870 (p < .002). This means that the risk of feeling anxious decreased by 13% for each one-unit satisfaction increase. Similarly, for preparedness, a one-unit increase entailed a 16% reduction in the odds of feeling anxious (OR = 0.848, p < .000).

In sum, with few minor variations, the individual models reveal that gender, age, academic year, enrollment status, online learning experience, satisfaction, and preparedness are strong predictors of feelings of anxiety among online students. While a lower level of online learning experience appears to be strongly associated with a feeling of anxiety (OR = 0.498, p < .000) followed by gender (OR = 1.333, p < .000), age seems to be weakly associated with online students' feelings of anxiety.

6.3.3. Full model
As a follow-up to the individual models, we built a full model with all of the predictors. A first run of the model showed that student age (OR = 0.934, p < .106) and satisfaction (OR = 744, p < .974) with OLO did not influence their feelings of anxiety; as a result, we excluded both variables from the final model.

In the full model (Table 5), gender (OR = 1.436, p < .000), online learning experience (OR = 0.4999, p < .000), and student preparedness (OR = 0.852, p < .000) were significant predictors of whether students felt anxious about online learning. Being a part-time student (OR = 1.201, p < .009), or a sophomore (OR = 0.561, p < .009) also predicted students' feelings of anxiety. More specifically, looking at the full model in Table 5, we note the following:

6.3.3.1. Gender
Gender is strongly associated with online students' feelings of anxiety. The odds ratio for a female online student to feel anxious increases by 43% when compared to male students. In line with our initial assumption, female students are more prone to feel anxious than their male counterparts.

6.3.3.2. Academic year
Except for sophomore students (OR = 0.561, p < .009), the rest of the academic year categories were not significant. When contrasted with freshman year results, the odds ratio of feeling anxious is 44% lower for those in their sophomore year. This finding supports our initial assumption: that online freshmen and sophomores are more disposed to feel anxious.

6.3.3.3. Enrollment status
Being a full-time student predicted feelings of anxiety among online students (OR = 1.201, p < .009). In comparison to full-time students, the odds of feeling anxious were 20% lower for part-time students. This finding aligned with our research assumption.

6.3.3.4. Online learning experience
Prior online learning experience was the most influential predictor of feelings of anxiety among online students (OR = 0.499, p < .000). The odds of feeling anxious among inexperienced online students decreased from 60% for students who had taken one to five courses to 44% for students who had completed between six and ten courses. In agreement with our research assumption, our analysis showed that online students who had completed more than ten courses were 24% less likely to feel anxious than those who didn't have any past online learning experience.

6.3.3.5. Online student preparedness
Online student preparedness was strongly associated with students' feelings of anxiety (OR = 0.852, p < .000). Consistent with our research assumption, unprepared students were 15% more inclined to feel anxious than prepared students.

To sum up, the full model reinforced the individual models' findings, while slightly strengthening the predictive ratio of gender and academic year. In contrast, the odds ratio for the Enrollment Status predictor went down slightly, from 1.26 to 1.20, while those for Online Learning Experience and Preparedness stayed the same.

7. Discussion
Knowing that feelings of anxiety divert students' cognitive resources from learning and task performance, even as they influence their motivation and self-regulation (Liaw & Huang, 2015), we examined the influence of students' demographics, prior experience, satisfaction, and preparedness on their feelings of anxiety. More specifically, we attempted to answer the following research questions:

7.1. How do Students' demographics (gender, age, academic year and enrollment status) Influence their feelings of anxiety?
The first question explored the predictive utility of students' demographics (gender, age, academic year, enrollment status) on online students' feelings of anxiety.

7.1.1. Gender
Our analysis shows that female students are more likely to feel anxious about taking online courses. These findings echo past studies in reaffirming female students' propensity to feel anxious about online courses (Conrad, 2002). This feeling of anxiety is probably due to the fact that female students, who outnumber male students in online courses, often juggle multiple roles and responsibilities (employee, mother, and wife). As a result, Zembylas (2008) argues that females taking online courses struggle to respond adequately to the demands and pressures exerted by these multiple roles and responsibilities. Along the same lines, prior studies report that female students are more anxious when using computers, and present a lower level of computer self-efficacy (Cai, Fan, & Du, 2017; He & Freeman, 2010), particularly when using certain Web 2.0 applications (Huang, Hood, & Yoo, 2013).

However, the technology gender gap is far from being conclusive. To the contrary, several studies highlight the overall advantage of female students when it comes to online learning. Hung, Chou, Chen, and Own (2010) suggested that gender does not influence online students' readiness, including their attitudes and behaviors towards self-directed learning and computer self-efficacy dimensions. Exhibiting a stronger self-efficacy than their male counterparts (Shen et al., 2013), female students are not only more receptive to online learning (Selwyn, 2007), but are also more engaged with content (Ekwunife-Orakwue & Teng, 2014) and are more active and satisfied with the online learning process than their male counterparts (González-Gómez, Guardiola, Martín Rodríguez, & Montero Alonso, 2012).

7.1.2. Age
Although descriptive statistics show that younger students are more prone to feel anxious (76.7% of anxious students belong to the first two age groups: 21 and under and 22 to 34), our regression model shows that age failed to predict feelings of anxiety among online students. Empirical support for this conclusion comes from Ke and Xie (2009), who found that age did not predict online “adult students' self-reported time or effort spent on learning tasks.” Along the same line, Ekwunife-Orakwue and Teng (2014) reported that age did not predict student learning outcomes and satisfaction. For their part, Chung, Park, Wang, Fulk, and McLaughlin (2010) pointed out that age did not influence either perceived ease of use and usefulness or intention to take part in online learning communities.

With these mixed conclusions in mind, it is safe to argue that any feelings of anxiety and emotional distress associated with online learning tend to diminish as one grows older. The academic, social, and emotional pressures felt by online students are likely to be lower among online adult learners, who leverage their experience to manage the emotional pressure associated with online learning.

7.1.3. Enrollment status
As a heterogeneous group, part-time online students increasingly outnumber traditional students in online programs (53.4% in our sample). Our data suggest that part-time students are less anxious than full-time students. The fact that part-time students are typically older and more experienced may explain their resilience against anxiety. Nevertheless, this conclusion does not align well with Osam, Bergman, and Cumberland's (2017) literature review which stressed that traditional adult learners are often anxious and fearful to return to school, because of their lack of low self-efficacy and their low self-esteem. However, one could argue that online adult part-time learners are often acknowledged for their self-efficacy and preparedness to succeed. They are more likely to find ways to adapt and to overcome their feelings of anxiety.

7.1.4. First-year students
As expected, freshman students were more prone to feelings of anxiety. Being ‘at risk’ for non-completion in traditional face-to-face courses (O'Keeffe, 2013), first-year students are more likely to feel anxious in online courses. As they struggle to transition to a new socio-cultural learning environment, first-year students' challenges are often compounded by feelings of anxiety associated with online learning. As our data showed, feelings of anxiety decreased significantly (44%) for sophomore students when contrasted with freshman students. This finding is plausible if one weighs in the academic, non-academic, and socio-individual factors that shape first-year students' experiences. Faced with competing demands and expectations, freshman students often struggle to navigate their first year successfully. Hence, providing adequate support will not only help first-year students confidently ground themselves into the new learning environment, but more importantly, it will enable them to establish sound learning strategies.

7.2. How does the number of online courses taken before (students' prior online learning experience) influence their feelings of anxiety?
The second question explored the influence of prior learning experience (number of online courses taken before) on feelings of anxiety. As predicted, past online learning experience is a strong predictor of diminished feelings of anxiety among online students. In agreement with existing literature, our study shows that prior online learning experience fosters students' confidence and preparedness to take online courses. Zimmerman and Kulikowich (2016) and Jan (2015) stated that students with prior online learning experience express a high online learning self-efficacy. Likewise, Scheitler (2015) concluded that participation in online programs boosted students' self-efficacy for online classes. In the same vein, Hachey et al., 2014, Hachey et al., 2015 suggested that prior online experience is strongly correlated with students' success and retention, regardless of their GPA. Moreover, Wang et al. (2013) found that students with past online experience are likely to use more effective learning strategies, which in turn can lead to a higher level of motivation and better grades. In sum, this finding is self-explanatory, as prior online learning experience boosts students' confidence and preparedness, which in turn defuses their feelings of anxiety associated with online learning.

7.3. How does students' satisfaction with the online learning orientation influence their feelings of anxiety?
The third question examined the influence of students' satisfaction with the online learning orientation on their feelings of anxiety. Descriptive statistics show a high level of student satisfaction with the online learning orientation, meaning that the orientation met students' needs and expectations. However, while the individual regression model of student satisfaction predicted students' feelings of anxiety, the global model was not significant. Surprisingly, once accounting for other predictors such as preparedness, students' satisfaction with the online learning orientation did not influence their feelings of anxiety. This finding is probably due to the collinearity of satisfaction with the feeling of preparedness. Students' preparedness and satisfaction are often positively associated with each other, especially for students who are confident in their abilities to take an online course. However, the overall influence of anxiety on online student satisfaction is well documented in the literature. On one side, as a short-term, subjective attitude (Cheng, Taylor, Williams, & Tong, 2016), students' satisfaction plays a decisive role in their persistence and success (Levy, 2007; Müller, 2008; Park & Choi, 2009). On the other side, Sun et al. (2008) argued that computer anxiety negatively influences their satisfaction with online learning. In the same way, Bolliger and Halupa (2012) noted that students' feelings of anxiety are negatively associated with their satisfaction with online learning. More recently, Lu, Hu, Gao, and Kinshuk (2016) reported a negative relationship between test anxiety and computerized adaptive testing performance and training satisfaction; likewise, Gupta (2017) found a strong correlation between anxiety and learning outcomes.

7.4. How does students' sense of preparedness after completing the OLO influence their feelings of anxiety?
The fourth question examined whether students' sense of preparedness after completing the OLO influenced their feelings of anxiety. As predicted, taken together, the descriptive analysis and the individual and full regression models showed a strong influence of students' sense of preparedness on their feelings of anxiety. This strong relationship reinforces the conclusions of past studies while underlining the importance of preparing students to take online courses. This is especially true when we know that online students are often unprepared for a range of e-learning competencies such as time management, critical thinking skills, and collaborating with others (Parkes et al., 2015). Kanuka and Jugdev (2006) contended that a course orientation reduces students' level of tension and anxiety, while it prepares them to complete the program successfully. Similarly, Holder (2007) concluded that preparedness is predictive of online students' persistence and retention. As expected, students' sense of preparedness is negatively associated with their feelings of anxiety. As they feel more confident and skilled in taking online courses, students' feelings of anxiety and frustration fade away.

In sum, in addition to filling the literature gap about the role of OLO in lessening online students' anxiety, the added-value of this study lays in two contributions: 1) identifying various factors that triggers students' feelings of anxiety will allow HEIs to better support them in their learning journey; 2) confirming past studies' findings with a large sample. Unlike past studies using small number of students, our study used a large sample over multiple semesters.

8. Limitations
Despite our research findings, we must acknowledge at least two limitations.

First, by relying exclusively on a single-item self-reported data, we run the risk that participants are likely to underrate their feelings of anxiety. Capturing situational emotions is difficult especially when dealing with multidimensional constructs such as online students' anxiety (Yoshida et al., 2016). However, self-reported data has been widely used and is trusted in institutional research (Gonyea, 2005). Similarly, as we have mentioned, single-item measurement use is not only a widespread practice in psychological and social sciences (Fuchs & Diamantopoulos, 2009), but it also considered adequate to measure anxiety (Davey et al., 2007), yielding strong test-retest reliability (Núñez-Peña et al., 2014).

Second, measuring emotional and affective behaviors, such as feelings of anxiety, requires repeated measurements over time. This can be difficult to implement. Although our data collection process has provided a snapshot of students' feelings of anxiety over multiple semesters, further research should track individual students' feelings of anxiety over time. Conducting a longitudinal study to gain an in-depth understanding of how students' feelings evolve should inform online course design and support.

9. Recommendations
One of the key insights of this study is that certain online students are prone to feelings of anxiety. As concluded by other studies, feelings of anxiety are likely to impede online students' ability, persistence, and overall performance. Helping students to transition to online learning, while reducing their feelings of anxiety, is an effective strategy to increase their preparedness and persistence down the road.

At the institutional level, our conclusions reiterate the need to provide students with a comprehensive online learning orientation to ease their transition into online learning, particularly for first-year students with no prior online learning experience. By doing so, administrators can boost students' self-confidence and readiness to persist, succeed, and take future online courses (Artino & Jones, 2012).

At the faculty level, recognizing the emotional dimensions affecting students' learning should inform faculty's efforts to guide students and should create a favorable online learning environment. To this end, faculty can show interest and empathy towards students as individuals by following up with those who are struggling, by encouraging them, and by directing them to support services capable of helping them learn how to learn online. Also, faculty should give students meaningful and timely feedback, to lessen their feelings of isolation, disengagement, and anxiety.

At the course design level, instructional designers and others involved in a course's design should build in activities and tutorials to boost students' study skills, time management, and computer self-efficacy, since each of these exerts a strong mediating influence on students' preparedness and readiness. Likewise, course designers should attend to course organization and assignment expectations and clarity. Disorganized courses and unclear assignments can impair online students' motivation and confidence to learn independently.

10. Conclusion
Keeping in mind that negative learning emotions are likely to impede online students' learning (Tempelaar et al., 2012), it's critical to mitigate these negative experiences before they interfere with students' readiness, motivation, and self-regulated learning strategies. By exploring the interplay of anxiety with various demographics, prior online learning experience, and sense of preparedness, we hope to uncover effective ways to boost students' confidence and ease their feelings of anxiety. Taken together, findings from this study provide insights for institutional decision-makers regarding the importance of promoting a positive online learning experience by alleviating students' anxiety to complete online courses. Enabling students to complete an online learning orientation should increase their sense of preparedness, defuse their feelings of anxiety, and ultimately contribute to their persistence and their success in their online courses. Indeed, exploring the influence of students' affective experiences (both negative and positive) on their performance and persistence warrants further investigation. Regarding performance, more research is needed to explore the influence of any anxiety and frustration experienced by online students on their learning outcomes. In terms of persistence, there is merit in understanding how feelings of anxiety influence a student's decision to withdraw, to continue, or even to enroll in future online courses. In so doing, we should be able not only to unpack the influence of emotions on online students, but, more importantly, to lessen their negative impact and to pave the way for increased student satisfaction, achievement, retention, and enrollment in future online courses.
