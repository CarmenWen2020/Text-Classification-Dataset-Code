Instructors' discussion design and facilitation have critical influences on online learning community development. Emerging network analysis methods were used to examine the development of an online learning community within a graduate-level course, the variations of an experienced instructor's discussion design, and the dynamics of her discussion facilitation. Results indicated that students gradually formed an interactive online learning community. The instructor, overall, played a facilitator role in this community; yet her participatory roles varied within different discussions during different time frames. Her participatory role evolved from a guide in the first class discussion, to varying roles, i.e., a facilitator, an observer, and a collaborator within different group discussions at the middle stages of the course, and to an observer in the course's later stages. Methodological implications for using social network analysis in online learning community research, and practical implications for designing and facilitating discussions that foster online learning communities were proposed.

1. Introduction
With the development of information and communication technologies, the concept of community extends to online contexts, such as online communities of inquiry (Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, 2000), online communities of practice (Wenger, White, & Smith, 2010), and online knowledge-building communities (Zhang, Scardamalia, Reeve, & Messina, 2009). Although an online community is defined in many ways and relevant studies have different research and practice foci, learners' communication, interaction, and participation are critical factors for community development (Lock, 2002). Particularly, anchored in the sociocultural perspective of learning (Vygotsky, 1978), online discussions stress the influences of learners' active interaction and participation on the development of effective online learning communities.

In the community development process, an instructor's discussion design and facilitation have critical influences on fostering learners' interaction and participation (Hewitt, 2005, Palloff and Pratt, 2007, Rovai, 2007). Relevant studies have documented the importance of instructors' group arrangements (Zhang, Scardamalia, Reeve, & Messina, 2009), online presences (Shea, Li, & Pickett, 2006), and interactions with learners (Jaggars & Xu, 2016) for online learning community development. However, instructors have faced challenges to foster online learning communities in practices. A low sense of connectedness (e.g., Ritter, Polnick, Fink, & Oescher, 2010), a lack of reciprocal interaction among learners (e.g., Tsiotakis & Jimoyiannis, 2016), and a low level of participation (e.g., Kim, 2013) were found in online learning. There is a need to provide practical strategies for instructors to use in order to engage learners within online learning communities.

In addition, there is a methodological gap in studying the influences of an instructor's discussion design and facilitation have on online learning community development. Most research studied instructors' involvement within the whole community (e.g., Fidalgo & Thormann, 2012) and the overall attributes of the whole community (e.g., Sing & Khine, 2006). The generalization resulted in unclear relationships between an instructor's involvement and the development process of online learning communities. Some studies showed that an instructor's active participation facilitated student engagement (e.g., Tsiotakis & Jimoyiannis, 2016), while other studies indicated that an instructor's active involvement did not necessarily lead to increased student interaction and participation (e.g., Zhao & Sullivan, 2017). Therefore, it is necessary to study this topic from a process-oriented perspective (Kabat, 2014, Reimann, 2009, Xin, 2012); that is, to examine how an online learning community develops over time, and how the instructor's discussion design and facilitation change throughout the whole duration of a course.

This study filled these research and practice gaps. Using emerging social network analysis methods, we examined (a) the development process of an online learning community in terms of different time frames, groups, and discussions within an online course, and (b) the variations of an experienced online instructor's discussion design and dynamic changes of her discussion facilitation during the community development process. Our research purposes were to provide (a) methodological implications for using emerging social network analysis methods in online learning community research, and (b) practical implications for designing and facilitating discussions that can foster online learning communities.

2. Literature review
2.1. Attributes and development processes of online learning communities
Empirical research has shown that learners' reciprocal interaction and continuous participation are critical indicators for online learning community development. For example, using statistical analysis and social network analysis, Shen, Nuankhieo, Huang, Amelung, and Laffey (2008) found that learner interaction was strongly associated with their perceived sense of community. Tang and Lam (2014)’s qualitative case study revealed that learners' high-level quantity of participation, and high-level quality of interaction were key factors that led to a sustainable online learning community. Using a three-dimensional analysis framework, Tsiotakis and Jimoyiannis (2016) revealed that critical factors for the development of an online learning community included learners' engagement, participation, and interaction. Therefore, learners' continuous participation and reciprocal interactions are likely to result in an interactive, cohesive, and equally-distributed network, which is a critical indicator of the formation of an online learning community.

In addition, learner interaction, participation and engagement in a community change over time, and an instructor's discussion design and facilitation strategies vary (van Leeuwen, Janssen, Erkens, & Brekelmans, 2013). The development of an online learning community may go through three basic stages (Palloff & Pratt, 2007). At the beginning, a group of learners may experience some level of interaction and communication, while most learners tend to observe rather than proactively interact with peers. In this stage, instructors often get involved in participating in discussions, interacting with learners, and modeling ways of online communication. As the community evolves into the second stage, learners have more chances to interact and collaborate with their peers through collaborative learning activities, and they begin to commit to the community through continuous participation. Instructors in this stage usually provide facilitation, guidance, and support to help learners generate shared interests, topics, and goals. As the community matures in the third stage, learners continue participating in discussions or collaborating in projects. Instructors in this stage tend to relinquish some guidance and instruction and give learners more independence and autonomy. Importantly, the community development process may not follow a sequential order and multiple stages may intertwine. Overall, learners' interaction and participation in an online learning community is a development process, where the changes and shifts of an instructor's facilitation play an important role.

2.2. Influences of instructors' discussion design on online learning community development
Instructors' discussion design has important influences on the ways that learners interact with each other and engage in discussions. Major considerations include group size, group composition, and discussion structure. For example, discussion group size has influences on the level of students' interaction and participation. Kim (2013) showed that learners in small-group discussions had a higher level of interactivity than they did in large-size discussions. Group composition and structure also have influences on learners' interaction and participation patterns. Learner interaction could be enhanced through more distributed and opportunistic collaboration grouping (e.g., Zhang et al., 2009). Learners' characteristics, backgrounds, and interests are also important factors to consider. A largely-homogeneous group might be counter-productive on forming an interactive community (e.g., Dawson, 2010), while small heterogeneous cooperative groups could be helpful for fostering active interaction (e.g., Fernández, 2007). Finally, peer moderation and role-playing can also be used to foster online community development (e.g., Ng et al., 2012, Stuetzer et al., 2013). In summary, discussion design strategies have influences on the ways in which learners interact with each other and engage in discussions, which in turn impacts the formation of online learning communities.

2.3. Influences of instructors' discussion facilitation on online learning community development
Discussion facilitation strategies can make a major difference in the extent to which students interact and collaborate with peers and how they participate and engage in the learning process (Rovai, 2007, Shea et al., 2006, Thormann and Fidalgo, 2014). An instructor's online presence and participation (Shea et al., 2006) and interaction with learners (Jaggars & Xu, 2016) are critical factors for fostering online learning communities. Previous research illustrates unclear relationships between an instructor's participation and involvement on students' interaction and participation. Some studies found that continuous facilitation from an instructor was necessary to promote learners' active participation in the online community (e.g., Fidalgo and Thormann, 2012, Tsiotakis and Jimoyiannis, 2016). These analyses also showed that the community of learners was centralized and evolved around the facilitator's rather than the learners' initiatives. Learners exhibited moderate or low rates of interaction and participation. In contrast, many other studies indicated that an instructor's active interaction and participation did not necessarily lead to more student interaction and engagement (e.g., An et al., 2009, Zhao and Sullivan, 2017). These studies found that less instructor presence and instructor-student interaction were observed in the discussions where students had more discussion initiation and peer interaction. Overall, the relationship between an instructor's participation and involvement and students' interaction and participation level is rather complicated.

2.4. Researching online learning communities
Due to the complex interplay of learners' interaction and participation, and the instructor's discussion design and facilitation, researching online learning communities is complicated. Although multiple research methods have been used, most research has approached online teaching and learning as a summative endeavor. For example, many studies used quantitative methods (e.g., the number, length, frequency of posts and comments) to summarize student participation for an entire course (e.g., Sing & Khine, 2006) or examine the instructor's frequency of interactions with students for the entire discussion (e.g., Mazzolini & Maddison, 2003). Other studies used qualitative methods (e.g., survey, interview) to explore students' perceived sense of community during online learning (e.g., Overbaugh & Nickel, 2011), to generalize instructor's facilitation behaviors (e.g., Mazzolini & Maddison, 2007), and to identify community-building guidelines (e.g., Yuan & Kim, 2014). This research provided high-level snapshots of online teaching and learning, but overshadowed important details of learning and facilitation that could change and shift within the timeframe of courses. In contrast, researchers can use a process-oriented perspective to examine the development process of an online learning community, including the changes in students' interaction and participation, and the variations of instructors' discussion design and changes of discussion facilitation.

Due to the importance of interaction and participation, we argue that social network analysis is an appropriate research method for analyzing online learning community development. Moreover, social network analysis can be used from a process-oriented perspective to uncover the changes of student interaction and discussion participation in an online learning community, and to examine variations of an instructor's discussion design and dynamic changes of discussion facilitation. In the following section, we review relevant literature using social network analysis methods to research online learning communities.

3. Social network analysis in online learning community research
3.1. Brief introduction
Social network analysis (SNA) has served as a primary research method for analyzing relations among entities, characteristics of relations, and influences of these relations on online teaching and learning (de Laat et al., 2007, Gruzd and Haythornthwaite, 2011, Oliveira and Gama, 2012). A social network is represented in graphics with entities (e.g., individuals, groups, resources, events) denoted as nodes with sizes, and relations between entities denoted as ties, with strengths and directions (Cohen, Manion, & Morrison, 2013). Conceptually, a social network can be structured as the one-mode network with one set of nodes, and the two-mode network (also referred to as affiliation or bipartite network) with two different sets of nodes, and ties existing only between nodes belonging to different sets (Opsahl, 2013). For example, the concept of one-mode network can be used in network analysis that only involves people (e.g., learner interaction network) or information (e.g., article citation structure), while the two-mode network can be used to analyze networks that involve both people and information (e.g., learners' resource use) or people and activities (e.g., learners' discussion participation). For both one-mode and two-mode networks, SNA offers a set of node-level and network-level measures to describe entity relations and network attributes (e.g., da Silva et al., 2014, Jimoyiannis et al., 2013, Rabbany et al., 2013).

3.2. SNA measures in online learning community research
Research has shown that SNA measures are important factors for evaluating the formation of online learning communities, community attributes, and participants' engagement and role change in the communities. In the node-level measure, degree represents total number of connections a participant has in the network. Degree includes indegree and outdegree, the number of ties pointing to or away from a participant (Freeman, 1978). Betweenness explains how a participant serve as a mediator in the shortest paths between two participants; closeness explains how close one participant is to others on average, measured along the shortest path (Opsahl, Agneessens, & Skvoretz, 2010). Betweenness reflects the intermediary effect a participant exerts over others in the network, and closeness reflects the efficiency a participant has in exchanging information to others (Butts, 2008). Closeness can be further divided into incloseness and outcloseness, reflecting the efficiency a participant has on receiving and spreading information, respectively.

In the network-level measures, density is the ratio of the number of actual relations to the number of all possible relations in a network. Average path length (APL) is defined as the average number of the shortest paths for all possible pairs of nodes. Reciprocity and transitivity can reflect participants' connection level within a network (Stepanyan, Mather, & Dalrymple, 2014), while centralization can illustrate the distributional characteristics of a network (Butts, 2008). Centralization values range from 0 (most evenly-distributed network) to 1 (most centralized network). Network cohesiveness can be illustrated by connectedness and Opsahl's global clustering coefficients (GCC) (Opsahl, 2015, Opsahl and Panzarasa, 2009), ranging from 0 (completely unconnected network) to 1 (most connected network).

In addition, the Detection and Support of Participatory Roles (DESPRO) method can be used to examine participatory roles in a network, in terms of the range of participants' participation (reflected by outdegree and outcloseness), influence (reflected by indegree and incloseness), and mediation (reflected by betweenness) (Marcos-García, Martínez-Monés, & Dimitriadis, 2015). In summary, SNA is an appropriate research method to represent online learning communities in graphic means (Cohen, Manion, & Morrison, 2013), to analyze relations between participants (Haythornthwaite, 2005) and relations between participants and learning activities (Opsahl, 2013), and to identify participants' participatory roles (Marcos-García, Martínez-Monés, & Dimitriadis, 2015).

3.3. Improving SNA in online learning community research
SNA can be improved in several ways for online learning community research. First, combining one-mode and two-mode network analysis can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of learner interactions and discussion participations. According to a systematic literature review, most SNA research has merely focused on analyzing the one-mode network namely learners' interaction network (Cela, Sicilia, & Sánchez, 2014). To date, there are relatively few studies focusing on two-mode network analysis (e.g., Hecking et al., 2014, Rodríguez et al., 2011, Stuetzer et al., 2013). Opsahl (2015)’s development of a R-package called tnet, used for the analytics of weighted one-mode networks and weighted two-mode networks, can help facilitate a more comprehensive network analysis.

Second, primary SNA measures used in previous studies originate from Freeman's (1978) binary network measures, which only consider the effect of the number of ties, and generalized measures for weighted networks, which only consider the effect of tie weights (Barrat et al., 2004, Brandes, 2001, Newman, 2001). The limitation of these measures leads to less accurate research conclusions. Opsahl's network measures that combine both the effect of the number of ties and the effect of tie weights (Opsahl, 2009, Opsahl, 2013, Opsahl et al., 2010, Opsahl and Panzarasa, 2009) can offer a more robust method to analyze online learning communities that stress interaction and participation.

Third, a combination of Opsahl's (2015) centralities and Marcos-García et al.'s (2015) participatory role method can improve the accuracy of participants' role examination. In previous studies, researchers usually approached a learner's participatory role from the perspective of their network position (e.g., central, peripheral position) (Rabbany, Elatia, Takaffoli, & Zaïane, 2013) or their activeness level (e.g., high, low interaction/participation frequency) (Hrastinski, 2008). These perspectives help to describe the learners' interaction and participation level to some extent, but they are not very accurate in describing a participant's role in an online community (Abnar, Takaffoli, Rabbany, & Zaïane, 2015). Marcos-García et al.’s (2015) DESPRO method, using centrality ranges to detect participatory roles, can be combined with Opsahl's (2015) centrality measures to make the results more accurate.

In this study, we proposed and applied an integrated network analysis framework to analyze the online learning community from the perspectives of one-mode and two-mode networks (i.e., attributes of interaction and participation networks, participants' centralities and positions within the networks). Further, from a process-oriented perspective, we analyzed interaction networks of different discussions during different time frames, and the dynamic changes of instructor's participatory roles in these discussions. DESPRO method (Marcos-García et al., 2015) was used to examine instructor's participatory roles in different discussions. Using emerging network analysis methods, we examine the development process of an online learning community, the variations of the instructor's discussion design, and dynamics of her facilitations in discussions.

4. Methods
4.1. Research purposes and questions
This study's purposes were to examine (a) the development process of an online learning community within a graduate-level online course, and (b) the influences of an experienced instructor's discussion design (e.g., group arrangement, discussion structure) and facilitation (e.g., interaction with students, participation in discussions) on the development process of an online learning community. There are three primary research questions:

1)
What were the attributes and development processes of the online learning community?

2)
Whether and how did the instructor's discussion design influence the development of the online learning community?

3)
Whether and how did the instructor's discussion facilitation influence the development of the online learning community?

4.2. Research context and participants
The research context was a completely online, graduate-level course offered at a midwestern university. This online course focused on theories of online learning communities and practices of building online learning communities. Twenty graduate students (16 females and 4 males) enrolled in this course during a 14-week semester of spring 2014; one of the researchers was enrolled as a doctoral student within this course. The instructor (Danielle, pseudonym) has 15 years of online teaching experience within higher education contexts and has received national attention for her masterful online pedagogical skills. Danielle designed various forms of online learning activities (see Table 1) for this course and hosted it on a social networking website called Ning. Learners were required to participate in at least seven discussions (three class-level discussions, one base group discussion, one small team discussion, one article-focused discussion, and one learning team facilitation discussion) within specific time frames. No maximum and/or minimum participation frequencies were required by the instructor.

4.3. Dataset
The original data included all topic-related and text-based discussions (41 posts, 1088 comments) from the course's asynchronous online discussion forum. These original data were transformed into two categories of network datasets: (a) directed and weighted one-mode participant-participant network dataset and (b) directed and weighted two-mode participant-discussion network dataset. In the one-mode networks, the direction represented who replied or mentioned whom in discussions (i.e., bi-directional), and tie weight represented the number of replies and mentions a participant made to others (i.e., interaction frequency). In the two-mode networks, the direction represented who participated in which discussion (i.e., uni-directional) and tie weight represented the number of times that a participant participated in a discussion (i.e., participation frequency). In addition, the two-mode participant-discussion network was projected into a one-mode network, where a node represented a participant, and the weight of a tie represented the number of participant's co-occurrence with others in discussions (i.e., co-participation frequency).

4.4. Analysis processes and strategies
We first analyzed network-level attributes and node-level centralities for the overall one-mode participant-participant interaction network, the overall two-mode participant-discussion network, and the projected one-mode network (the one-mode version of a two-mode network) (see Table 2). It should be mentioned that some measures (e.g., degree, closeness, betweenness, APL) are significantly influenced by measure principles they are grounded upon. For one-mode network analysis, we use Opsahl's tuning parameter α values (0, 0.5, 1) to calculate indegree, outdegree, closeness, and betweenness (Opsahl et al., 2010). For outdegree and indegree, when α is set to 0, the measure calculates the number of people that a participant interacted with; when α is set to 1, the measure calculates the total interaction frequency between two participants; when α is set to 0.5, with the same interaction frequency, the participant who interacts with more people has a higher degree score. For closeness and betweenness, when α is set to 0.5, a shorter path composed of low interaction frequency is favored over a longer path with high interaction frequency; when α is set to 1.5, paths with more intermediaries that have high interaction frequency are favored; when α is set to 1, it produces the same outcome as the Dijkstra shortest path (Dijkstra, 1959), calculated merely on the interaction frequency between two nodes. In addition, there are two ways to measure degree for the two-mode network, namely the number of discussions a participant has participated in, disregarding the participation frequency (α = 0), and a participant's total participation frequency in all discussions (α = 1). For projected one-mode network, there are three degree measures: the number of participants that a participant is directly or indirectly connected to in same discussions (α = 0); with the same co-participation frequency, the participant who interacts with more participants has a higher degree score (α = 0.5); and the number of a participant's co-participation frequency with other participants in all discussions (α = 1).

Next, we examined the online learning community development in different discussions during different time frames. We examined one-mode interaction networks (i.e., network-level attributes and node-level centralities) of three class-level and eight randomly-selected group-level discussions. The same network-level measures for weighted one-mode network analysis were used (see Table 2). In addition, based on the result comparison, we stress Opsahl (2015)’s measure with the α value of 0.5 because it takes into account the effect of both the number of participants and the interaction frequency, which aligns with the attributes of an online learning community. Therefore, we only used Opsahl (2015)’s measures with the α value of 0.5 to examine the node-level centralities of three class-level and eight randomly-selected group-level discussions.

Finally, we adapted Marcos-García et al.’s (2015) DESPRO method to examine the instructor's participatory roles in all discussions, three class-level and eight group-level discussions. Adapting the DESPRO method, we define that the instructor has a guide role with high levels of participation (reflected by outdegree and outcloseness), influence (reflected by indegree and incloseness), and mediation (reflected by betweenness); a facilitator role with the medium to high level of mediation, yet not high levels of participation and influence; a collaborator role with a medium to high level of participation or influence, and low to medium levels of mediation; and an observer role with low levels of participation, influence and mediation. All centralities were calculated when Opsahl (2015)’s α value was set to 0.5.

5. Results
5.1. The overall one-mode participant-participant interaction network
Overall, all participants (i.e., students and Danielle) formed an interactive (reflected by high scores of interaction frequency, mutual dyad ratio and reciprocity), cohesive (reflected by high scores of density, components, connectedness and Opsahl's GCC), and equally-distributed (reflected by low score of centralization) learning community (see Table 3). All participants were connected in one single group; there were no isolated participants in the network. Students who located in the peripheral area had a certain level of interactions with other participants (see Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. The overall one-mode participant-participant interaction network. Danielle was noted in blue node. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

As we can see from the node-level results (see Table 4), Danielle, along with two students, had the largest outdegree of 20; that is, they initiated interaction with all other 20 participants. Danielle sent a total of 72 replies/mentions to students, ranked as fifth among all participants. Danielle's rank of outdegree score decreased after taking the interaction frequency into consideration (when α was set from 0 to 0.5 and 1). This result indicated that Danielle interacted with all students during the 14-week course, yet the frequency of that interaction was not as high as some students. In addition, Danielle's highest indegree scores indicated that Danielle received the most replies and mentions from students. Danielle had the highest closeness along with two students when α was set to 1.5, yet her rank dropped to fourth when α was set to 0.5. This also indicated that Danielle tended to interact directly with most students; yet, her interaction frequency was not the highest among all participants. Moreover, Danielle's highest betweenness score indicated her intermediary effect in discussions.

5.2. The overall two-mode participant-discussion network
All participants tended to participate in certain discussions, which was reflected by the low score of network density (see Table 5). The ties connected with the base group discussions were relatively thicker than other ties, indicating that participants participated more frequently in the base group discussions. Moreover, the central location of the class-level discussions (C1, C2 and C3) in the overall two-mode network indicated that most participants participated in three class-level discussions (see Fig. 2). Further analysis demonstrated that five pairs of students (B and H, C and G, D and F, L and M, O and T) had the highest co-participation frequency; they co-participated in 6 discussions. Danielle's co-participation frequency with students was in the range of 1–3. The smaller score of Opsahl's GCC for the two-mode participant-discussion network than its score for the projected one-mode network also indicated that students participated in certain discussions rather than a majority of discussions.

Fig. 2. The overall two-mode participant-discussion network. Danielle was noted in blue node. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

In the node-level results (see Table 6), most participants, including Danielle, participated in seven discussions; student F was the only participant who participated in eight discussions. Danielle ranked 12th in the degree score when α was set to 1, which meant that although she participated in seven different discussions as most students did, her participation frequency in the discussions was not high. For the projected one-mode network, all participants had a degree score 20, when α was set to 0; that is, all participants were directly or indirectly connected to the rest of the class through the discussion participation. In addition, when α was set to 0.5, Danielle had the highest betweenness score, while student F had the highest betweenness score when α was set to 1 and 1.5. In other words, Danielle tended to interact with students in a relatively low frequency, while student F tended to interact with others in a relatively high frequency.

5.3. The class-level and group-level discussion networks
For three class-level discussions, there was a gradual increase in the number of participants, number of ties, student-student interaction frequency, average degree, density, and percentages of mutual and asymmetric dyads and a decrease of instructor-student interaction from C1 to C2 and C3. In addition, except for a decrease of reciprocity for C2, there was a general increasing trend for reciprocity and transitivity. An increase of connectedness and Opsahl's GCC score, and a decrease of numbers of components were found. Centralization scores of C1, C2, and C3 were relatively low (see Table 7). Overall, for class-level discussions, participants gradually formed an interactive, cohesive, and equally-distributed interaction network (see Fig. 3).

Fig. 3. Interaction networks for class-level and group-level discussions. Danielle was noted in blue node. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

Students had different interaction tendencies in different group-level discussions. In base group discussions, students had higher interaction frequency, average degree, density, mutual and asymmetric dyads, and Opsahl's GCC than they had in other forms of group discussions. There was a general decrease of student-student interaction frequency as the course progressed from base group discussions to other forms of group discussions. In addition, compared to the high frequency of student interaction for the whole class (i.e., All discussions), students had relatively low interaction frequency in some group discussions (e.g., TC, A4, LT4).

5.4. Instructor's participatory roles
With medium to high levels of outdegree and outcloseness, medium levels of indegree and incloseness, and a high level of betweenness, Danielle played a facilitator role during the whole course in the overall interaction network (see Table 8). It should be mentioned that Danielle's overall high indegree partially resulted from students' frequent mentions in C3. Most students appreciated her online course design and facilitation and thanked her for her contributions and hard work during the course. The highly-scored indegree was not considered as Danielle's proactive participation. So we identified Danielle with a medium level of influence (indegree and incloseness). Danielle did not locate at the center of the interaction network (see Fig. 1), which was consistent with her facilitator role. Considering the range of Danielle's centrality scores and her position in the network, we concluded that Danielle played a facilitator role for the entire 14-week course.

Danielle played different roles in the three class-level discussions. With the highest levels of centralities among all participants, Danielle played a guide role in the C1 class-level discussion. As the course progressed to C2, most of Danielle's centrality scores decreased to the lowest levels, except a medium level of indegree. Danielle played an observer role in C2. In C3, again, most of Danielle's centrality scores were 0 and remained the lowest levels among all participants, except her highest level of indegree due to students' mentions. Considering Danielle's absence of proactive participation in C3, we concluded that Danielle's high levels of indegree score did not change her role as an observer in C3 (see Fig. 3).

Danielle also played different roles in group-level discussions. With low-level scores of outdegree, outcloseness, indegree, incloseness and betweenness, Danielle had a role of observer in B2. She had a role of facilitator in B4 with low to medium level of outdegree, medium to high level of outcloseness, low level of indegree and incloseness and medium level of betweenness. Danielle played the same role of collaborator in TA and TC, with the medium to high level of outdegree, low level of outcloseness, indegree, incloseness, and betweenness. Danielle's positions were not at the center of the networks (see Fig. 3). As the course progressed, Danielle played the same role as an observer in A2 and A4, without actively participating in either discussion. Danielle also played the same role as an observer in LT3 and LT4.

6. Discussion
6.1. The attributes and development processes of the online learning community
Together, the students and the instructor, Danielle, formed an interactive, cohesive, and equally-distributed learning community within the online course (see Table 3). All participants were connected in one single community; there were no isolated participants in the networks (see Figs. 1 and 2). The significant increase of student-student interaction frequency, the decrease of instructor-student interaction frequency, as well as the gradual increases on density, reciprocity, transitivity and Opsahl's GCC all indicated that students formed an interactive and cohesive community as the course progressed from C1 (week 2) to C2 (week 8) and C3 (week 14). Compared to previous studies revealing online learning networks that had low-level reciprocal interactions (e.g., Zhang, Liu, Chen, Wang, & Huang, 2017), and discussions that were dominated by a few students (e.g., Giannini-Gachago & Seleka, 2005) or instructors (e.g., Tsiotakis & Jimoyiannis, 2016), this study demonstrated the development process of an interactive, cohesive, and equally-distributed learning community as this online course progressed during a 14-week duration.

6.2. The instructor's discussion design on the development of the online learning community
Danielle's discussion design and group arrangement had important influences on students' participation patterns and group formations in online learning communities. First, the instructor's design of an interweaving integration of class-level and group-level discussions helped students form an online learning community. Given the influences of group size on participant interactions (Caspi, Gorsky, & Chajut, 2003), small group discussions (e.g., base groups, article-based groups, learning teams) can be interwoven with whole-class discussions to help build social connections, improve interaction opportunities, and balance overall information loads (Qiu & McDougall, 2013).

Moreover, the integration of different group arrangements had critical influences on the online learning community development. First, our results showed that students interacted more frequently with their peers in the base group discussions than they did in other forms of group discussions. Therefore, the use of base groups where students have similar academic interests and professional goals, particularly, at the early stage of an online course (Dringus & Ellis, 2010), is a good strategy to foster' social connections and improve interaction frequencies in the community. Furthermore, a decrease of student interactions within other small groups implied some restrictions of Danielle's group arrangements. Although Danielle offered students multiple opportunities to interact and collaborate with different cohorts of peers, she did not encourage students to participate in discussions beyond instructor-assigned groups or groups they chose to participate in. Therefore, these small group discussions had “fixed” features: they took place at fixed phases according to time parameters and discussion topics (Zhang et al., 2009). Due to this “fixed” feature, students tended to only participate in some specific group discussions rather than communicate with peers outside of assigned groups.

Student F′s participation behaviors further confirmed that the use of opportunistic collaboration could have potentials to help students achieve a larger range of interaction and a higher level of information diffusion (Siqin et al., 2015, Zhang et al., 2009). Results showed that F, as the only student who participated beyond assigned groups, had a high co-participation frequency with other participants, and high scores of degree, betweenness, and closeness in both one-mode and two-mode networks (see Tables 4 and 6). Therefore, interactions with peers in different discussions, participatory role changes, and group switching behaviors may render participants advantageous positioning within a network (Dawson, 2008, Stuetzer et al., 2013). Instructors can integrate opportunistic collaboration groups with “fixed” group configuration to foster online learning community development.

Lastly, the instructor's group configuration in early stages of the course could, to some extent, have influences on students' later group formation. The pairs of students who had higher frequency of co-participation in discussions were either from the same instructor-assigned base groups (e.g., B and H, D and F) or from the same instructor-assigned small teams (e.g., C and G, O and T). This is consistent with Cho, Gay, Davidson, and Ingraffea's (2007) conclusion that pre-existing networks can significantly influence the formation of later community.

6.3. The instructor's discussion facilitation on the development of the online learning community
Danielle's discussion facilitation had important influences on the online learning community development. First, the instructor's leadership role in the early stage of a course is critical to nurture an online learning community. As a guide, Danielle's active interaction with students at the beginning assisted students in developing a supportive learning network in many ways, such as promoting instructor-student connections and group cohesiveness (Berge, 1995), mediating the disembodied nature of online learning environments (Palloff & Pratt, 2007), and modeling ways to interact with others online (Stodel, Thompson, & MacDonald, 2006). Moreover, in terms of student engagement level, instructors should consider to change interaction behaviors and participatory roles in different group discussions. For example, students in B2 were more interactive than students in B4; accordingly, Danielle played a less active role as an observer in B2 and a more active role as a facilitator in B4. In addition, instructors' relinquishment of the authority in the middle and late stages can encourage students to take on an independent, autonomous, and self-regulatory role in the online learning community. For example, as students started to demonstrate autonomy, Danielle changed her participatory roles to a collaborator in small team discussions, and an observer in the article-focused discussions as well as the rest of discussions.

In summary, Danielle's overall role as a facilitator for the whole 14-week course, and her participatory role changes in different discussions, helped students shift into a learner-directed and peer-supported environment that fosters a community. In line with the results of instructors' facilitation reported in previous empirical studies (e.g., Kwon et al., 2014, Skrypnyk et al., 2015, van Leeuwen et al., 2013), Danielle's facilitation strategies and participatory roles varied among different groups and at different times during the course duration. This study indicates that the facilitation of an online learning community is a complex matter, where the instructor's leading, facilitating, collaborating, and observing come to the fore at different time frames within different class and group discussions.

7. Conclusions and implications
Recent research has documented the positive yet complex influence of instructors' discussion design and facilitation strategies in the formation of online learning communities (e.g., Park et al., 2015, van Leeuwen et al., 2013, Zheng and Warschauer, 2015). Applying emerging network analysis methods, this study provided a detailed example of how the variations of an instructor's discussion design and dynamics of discussion facilitation influenced the development of an online learning community. We concluded that the formation of a cohesive online learning community was observed, and that the influence of instructor's discussion design and facilitation on the online learning community development was complex. Our SNA results not only provided new research directions for a more comprehensive study (e.g., triangulate SNA with content and discourse analysis), but more importantly, provided practical implications on discussion design and facilitation that can foster online learning community development and methodological implications on the use of social network analysis methods in online learning community research.

Our study provides practical suggestions for instructors to strengthen and support development of interactive online learning communities. First, this study suggests that instructors should take a facilitative role, balancing between discussion participation and authority relinquishment in different stages. Aligning with results from other empirical research, results of this study indicate that to foster student interaction and participation, instructors should establish a more symmetrical relationship with students (Park et al., 2015), give up the “more is better” communicative pattern (Dawson, McWilliam, & Tan, 2008), and balance between being partly managerial and partly facilitative (Zhao & Sullivan, 2017). Second, the instructor's discussion design and group arrangement have influences on student group formations and student participation patterns in discussions. Different discussion structures (Zhang et al., 2009), configurations of groups (Cen, Ruta, Powell, Hirsch, & Ng, 2016) and time factors (Dringus & Ellis, 2010) can yield different interaction patterns and participation behaviors. The course's clear structure (e.g., the interweaving of weekly class-level and group-level discussions) have positive influences on the online learning community development. In order to encourage students' participation and engagement, instructors can consider to use the combination of opportunistic collaboration groups (e.g., students-formed/disbanded groups under the volition of the groups) and “fixed” groups (e.g., instructor-arranged groups). There are currently no universal principles of discussion design and facilitation strategies that are the most effective for fostering learner interaction and discussion participation (Brook and Oliver, 2003, Charalambos et al., 2004, Sing and Khine, 2006). The use of multiple strategies proposed in this study can help foster a larger range of interaction and participation in learning networks, which in turn, can be conducive for the formation of online learning communities.

Moreover, we provide methodological implications for applying emerging social network analysis methods in online learning community research. First, for one-mode networks, we recommend using Opsahl's (2015) method with the α value of 0.5 to calculate degree, closeness and betweenness centralities. Taking into account the effect of both the number of participants and the interaction frequency, this measure aligns with the philosophy of the attributes and development processes of online learning communities. Moreover, combining Opsahl's (2015) centrality measures with Marcos-García et al.’s (2015) DESPRO is a useful method to result in a more accurate result of participatory roles. In the network-level analysis, Butts (2014) and Butts et al. (2015) measures on reciprocity and transitivity are important factors for measuring the connectedness of an online learning community. Opsahl's GCC can result in a more accurate result than Butts' components and connectedness measures. Centralization measures proposed by Butts (2014) and Butts et al. (2015) can be used to illustrate the distribution of participants' positional advantages. In the node-level analysis, basic statistics, such as student-student, student-instructor, and instructor-student interaction frequency are simple yet useful measures. In addition, for the two-mode networks, we recommend two calculations of degrees: the degree for the two-mode network and the degree for the projected one-mode network. Again, Opsahl's α value of 0.5 is recommended to calculate the degree, closeness and betweenness centralities. For the network-level analysis, we recommend using basic bipartite statistical methods to calculate the number of nodes, number of ties, and density, and use Opsahl's global clustering coefficient to calculate the two-mode network's cohesiveness.

In conclusion, we shared a detailed example of how the variations of an instructor's discussion design and dynamic changes of discussion facilitation can influence the development of an interactive and cohesive online learning community. This study (a) applied emerging network analysis methods to examine participant interaction and discussion participation in online learning communities; and (b) provided practical strategies for discussion design and facilitation that can foster an interactive online learning communities. Currently, to triangulate these network analysis results, we have been conducting a multi-methodological research to examine the influences of the instructor's online presence, discourse move, and language use on students' collaborative inquiry in the online learning community.
