Online graduate degree programs, particularly in technical disciplines, represent a fast-growing market for higher education institutions. Yet, it is unclear how online degree programs fit within students' educational investment decisions and career goals. Based on a foundation of human capital theory, and using data from a 2017 survey of students enrolled in an online master's degree program in computer science at a highly ranked US university, this study explores how motivation for seeking an online graduate degree in computer science varies by student demographics and professional background/preparation. Results show two student markets: one for career mobility, including job advancement and/or career change, and another for skill building without consideration of mobility. Our results also show that while students come from diverse backgrounds, the primary driving factor for seeking the degree is determined by relevant professional experience. Implications for future study and online instructional design are discussed.

1. Introduction
As online degree programs rapidly expand throughout higher education, highly ranked institutions are also beginning to offer online graduate degrees (Cheng & Ho, 2001; Deming, Goldin, Katz, & Yuchtman, 2015; Kolowich, 2014; Seaman, Allen, & Seaman, 2018). Our particular interest is in the information technology (IT) field, where computer science is one of the fastest-growing disciplines at the post-secondary and graduate levels, and has among the highest percentages of online degrees of all science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines (National Science Board, 2018). Compared to other STEM disciplines, computer science features many professional master's programs that deliberately prepare students for a career (a “terminal degree”) (Professional Science Master's, 2018), although not precluding advancement to a PhD program. While online graduate degrees in computer science have been hailed as a major educational innovation by the National Science Board (National Science Board, 2018), we understand little about the market for these programs. Our interest is in how online degree programs fit within students' educational investment decisions and career goals, especially at the graduate-degree level (Grzeda & Miller, 2009; Yoo & Huang, 2013). Although our research was conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, understanding these issues remains relevant for those developing and leading online graduate degree programs.

Traditional models of career development such as human capital theory (Becker, 2009) suggest that students pursue undergraduate and graduate education early in life so that they can maximize the returns on education over the course of their careers. Similarly, studies on work motivation suggest that interest in seeking new skill development and learning decreases over the life span due to declines in cognitive abilities and extrinsic rewards (Kanfer, 2012). However, recent national survey data challenges these assumptions, showing that non-traditional students such as mid-career, full-time employees are more likely to enroll in online courses and fully online degree programs than their younger peers (Ortagus, 2017). Explanations for this phenomenon vary. From a microeconomic standpoint, online degrees decrease the real and opportunity costs to obtain reputable new credentials and take deliberate actions to advance or change one's career (Goodman, Melkers, & Pallais, 2019; Ortagus, 2017; Ragusa & Crampton, 2018). From a work motivation perspective, online degrees use instructional formats that may be more congruent with the self-regulatory and self-paced learning styles of older adults (Kanfer, 2012; Ortagus, 2017; Otter et al., 2013). In addition, technological advancements and the changing nature of work have created an expanding market for IT professionals and a greater demand for people with advanced degrees (Xue & Larson, 2015). Steady job-growth and the relatively high pay that computer scientists command make IT an attractive field for workers (Autor, Dorn, & Hanson, 2015; Mehta & Uhlig, 2017). Further, given technological changes, online master's degrees may also be valuable for workers who may need to upskill to keep up with current IT trends and skill demands while continuing to work full-time. As such, online graduate degrees may serve as a tool for adult students to change their profession from non-IT to IT, or for IT professionals to advance in their current job and profession.

In light of the rapidly-changing IT labor market and corresponding growth in online degrees, understanding how mid-career and other graduate students view the value of the online degree credential may help address the supply/demand gap in the IT labor market. We examine what motivates student decisions to pursue master's degrees in computer science and how the availability of an online graduate degree program at a highly ranked institution factors into the calculus behind these choices. This issue is especially relevant within STEM workforce and education policy realms, given the attractive IT labor market, innovations in education delivery, and opportunities to increase participation and representativeness in a technical discipline. In the face of changing technological labor markets, conceptions of careers, and low-cost online graduate education, we ask:

How does motivation for seeking an online master's degree in computer science vary by student demographics and professional background/preparation?

We frame our study by drawing on human capital theory, which explains individual motivation to invest in education as a means of building skills, abilities, and knowledge (i.e., human capital) and achieving economic and other related returns (Ballout, 2007; Becker, 2009). In our study, we focus on the type of career benefit working adults hope to achieve by seeking an online graduate degree in computer science from a well-recognized institution. Specifically, we examine students' vision of their post-graduation career trajectories, which may include career entry, advancement, change, or stability (Ojala, Isopahkala-Bouret, & Varhelahti, 2021).

Despite the need for policy-informing research, there has been limited study of student motivation to pursue online graduate degrees and their related student experiences. There is great variation in regard to students' pre-existing levels of human capital in prior studies, challenging the formation of general hypotheses, particularly within a discipline. Given the scarcity of empirical studies and related literature, we seek to contribute to the development of a research agenda in online graduate education by examining behavioral patterns and demographic trends. Adults seeking an online master's degree are entering the program with a range of human capital acquired through work and their undergraduate training (for example) and are likely to be prioritizing skill development relevant to their careers (Littenberg-Tobias & Reich, 2020; Noe, Tews, & Dachner, 2010), both of which pose distinct challenges for online degree program leaders and curriculum designers. There is also little information on the ability of graduate-entry degree programs to address underrepresentation in IT (Harding, Jamieson, Withington, Hudson, & Dixon, 2018; Main & Schimpf, 2017). We conclude by discussing the implications of adult students' (potentially) diverse range of human capital characteristics on their educational goals , and therefore on course content, design, and course offerings in online graduate programs aimed at working adults.

2. Literature review
2.1. Motivation for pursuing a graduate degree
Studies of individual decisions to pursue higher education often rely on the foundation of human capital theory to identify the decision factors relevant to student choices (Altonji, Arcidiacono, & Maurel, 2016; Cornacchione & Daugherty, 2013). In this human capital framework, the investment of time, effort and other resources in pursuing further education is based on the expectation of greater returns to career and related income (Ballout, 2007; Becker, 2009). A strong focus in the human capital literature is on assessing whether these expected outcomes do, in fact, occur. Specifically, studies use human capital theory to predict and estimate career attainment (e.g., (un)employment) (Avery & Turner, 2012), career success (e.g., earnings, promotion) (Gándara & Toutkoushian, 2017; Hirschi, Nagy, Baumeler, Johnston, & Spurk, 2018; Judge, Klinger, & Simon, 2010; Okahana & Hao, 2019), or broader social benefits (e.g., quality of life, life satisfaction) (Hout, 2012; Oreopoulos & Salvanes, 2011). However, the literature on how an individual's existing human capital plays a role in graduate school investment decisions is underdeveloped (Altonji et al., 2016). An important goal of our research is to develop a more robust understanding of how existing human capital matters for the online graduate student learning experience in a technical discipline, including labor market and other benefits that students expect to achieve with their degree.

Life and career stage factors are highly relevant when examining graduate student experiences, and decisions to enroll. While many students transition from undergraduate to graduate school immediately, other students – frequently termed adult students – return to graduate school after having gained work and life experiences (Peters & Daly, 2013). In fact, educational pathways, including the timing to attain graduate degrees, have been becoming increasingly diverse (Hostetler, Sweet, & Moen, 2007), warranting the study of older student populations. For prospective graduate students who have often been in the labor force for some time, their existing professional skills and know-how (human capital) plays a role in their decision to invest in graduate education (Peters & Daly, 2013).

Theory and research suggest that adult students (typically those above age 25) pursue education for reasons and career motives that are different from those of traditionally aged-peers (DeJoy, 1997). Studies examining the motivational and behavioral processes in more detail recognize that adult learners are typically very deliberate in their consumption of education, only pursing credentials directly tied to their career goals (Brus, 2006; Compton, Cox, & Laanan, 2006). That is, adults tend to consume education that provides a clear professional benefit for them (Francois, 2014).

Adult students have often been studied within the context of returning for an undergraduate degree later in life (Banks, 2017; DeJoy, 1997; Kim, Shin, Smith, & Hwang, 2018), which is problematic since motivation to return to school may differ among undergraduate and graduate students (Francois, 2014). Studies examining students' motivation to return to school for a graduate degree, including adult students' decision to return to graduate school for career change or advancement, remain scarce (Hegarty, 2011; Masdonati, Fournier, & Lahrizi, 2017). The limited empirical evidence indicates that graduate students are highly extrinsically motivated, hoping to directly apply their skills and knowledge in their current job or future career (Flynn, 2006; Niall Hegarty, Brasco, & Lu, 2012; Yoo & Huang, 2013). However, the particular benefit or value of a graduate degree will likely depend on an individual's career trajectory (Ojala et al., 2021). Younger students participate in graduate education to build their human capital in preparation for entering the job market and establishing their careers (Oreopoulos & Petronijevic, 2013). In contrast, older, mid-career adult students with accumulated skills and work experience may pursue graduate education to maintain their human capital and/or advance in their career (Flynn, 2006). For example, Peters and Daly's (2013) qualitative study on engineering professionals returning to graduate school finds that students particularly value the utility of a graduate degree in terms of expanding skills and improving opportunities to shift work tasks and change job fields.

In addition, research suggests the need to account for differences in motivational orientation by gender. Studies show that female adult students are either equally (Yoo & Huang, 2013) or more strongly (Flynn, 2006) extrinsically motivated than male students to pursue a graduate degree. Women may possibly delay advanced education due to family life cycles and seek degrees as a way to catch up and advance in the labor market (Hostetler et al., 2007).

2.2. Motivation for pursuing a graduate degree in a technical discipline
Computer science is an attractive field of study in terms of career prospects. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, computer and IT occupations are expected to grow much faster than the average of all occupations over the next ten years (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019). In addition, computer and IT occupations offer a high earning potential, with the median annual wage being nearly $50,000 higher than for all other occupations (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019). High employability and earnings represent pull factors for students to seek a degree and career in computer science. In fact, research on educational decision-making has shown that people's expectations about labor market prospects (e.g., wages, job opportunities) predict their educational investments (Lauer, 2002).

At the same time, the nature of computer and IT occupations is constantly changing. Technological advancements demand skill sets that not only differ from the competencies that IT professionals needed in the past, but also are increasingly broad and comprehensive (Kappelman, Jones, Johnson, McLean, & Boonme, 2016). Thus, staying relevant in the workforce requires IT professionals to expand and update existing technical knowledge and skills, thereby representing push factors to seek continuing education and training. From a human capital theory perspective, adult students seeking an online graduate degree in computer science may not necessarily plan to advance in their careers but may have strong interest in enhancing their employment stability and gaining new responsibilities within their existing job by updating their skills and/or validating their expertise (Ojala et al., 2021).

However, formal training is not necessarily a condition for career success and advancement within the IT field (Hirschheim & Klein, 2012). Instead, technical certifications and other continuing education are common methods of skill advancement in response to changing technologies and IT infrastructures (Jepsen, Troske, & Coomes, 2014). Despite this, advanced degrees still have significant value in the labor market (Rosendale, 2017), corresponding to higher salaries for IT professionals (Mithas & Krishnan, 2008) and representing valuable career enhancers as IT professionals move up the career ladder from entry level jobs to mid-level management positions (Kappelman et al., 2016). Further, for individuals without a formal degree in a technical discipline and lacking prior computing work experience, returning to school to get an advanced degree may facilitate entry into a labor market that exhibits considerable knowledge and skill requirements and, thus, barriers to entry (Ibarra, 2004). Taken together, online graduate degrees may serve as a tool particularly for early to mid-career adult students with moderate levels of human capital to acquire a job in IT and/or advance in their IT career through promotions.

2.3. Motivation for pursuing an online graduate degree
Our interest is not only in working adults' decision and motivation to attend graduate school, but to pursue their degree in an online program. Attending graduate school represents a significant investment in money and time (Blagg, 2018). Studies indicate that, unlike direct-pathway students, returning adults' decision to pursue a graduate degree is much more susceptible to cost considerations, including both financial expenses and time commitments (Mosyjowski, Daly, Peters, Skerlos, & Baker, 2017; Peters & Daly, 2013). Online degree programs, however, offer the promise of lowering costs, both in real terms and in terms of lost opportunity. Expenses for tuition and fees have increased at a slower rate for online than for brick-and-mortar programs (Blagg, 2018), making online education more affordable (Deming et al., 2015). Further, online degrees lower opportunity costs by introducing greater flexibility to manage work and family responsibilities, and by eliminating relocation expenses that might occur with the pursuit of an in-person degree (Goodman, Melkers, & Pallais, 2019; Yoo & Huang, 2013). In fact, there is evidence that students who experience the highest opportunity cost are more likely to enroll in fully online degree programs (Ortagus, 2017). As such, online degree programs may improve access to graduate education particularly for adult learners (Goodman, Melkers, & Pallais, 2019), but not necessarily equally for all demographic groups such as minority students (Ortagus, 2017).

However, there remains a gap regarding student motivation for enrollment, experiences, and outcomes in a fully online graduate degree program and offered by a traditional university. Studies of online education rarely examine complete degree programs, although there has been considerable study of decisions to enroll and experiences in massive open online courses [MOOCs] (Watted & Barak, 2018; Zhu, Sari, & Lee, 2018) and single courses (Bainbridge et al., 2015; McPartlan, Rutherford, Rodriguez, Schaffer, & Holton, 2021; O'Neill, Lopes, Nesbit, Reinhardt, & Jayasundera, 2021; Song & McNary, 2011). However, these latter examples are notably different in terms of investment and human capital gains. Importantly, the decision to enroll in an online degree program represents a significant resource and life commitment for many adult students (Kreth, Spirou, Budenstein, & Melkers, 2019; Vanslambrouck, Zhu, Lombaerts, Philipsen, & Tondeur, 2018), who may struggle to develop their learning skills and balance personal and work demands. This type of commitment is practically and theoretically distinct from students' motivation (i.e., their outcome expectations) associated with enrolling in a single course or MOOC.

Past studies of online degree programs have typically focused on for-profit undergraduate degree programs, which are entangled in a unique set of policy concerns (Ortagus, 2017). In contrast, our interest lies in high-quality degree programs (Holzweiss, Joyner, Fuller, Henderson, & Young, 2014) from public “flagship” institutions (e.g. Arizona State, Colorado State, Georgia Tech), which have increased their online student enrollments in recent years (Deming et al., 2015; Kolowich, 2014; Seaman, Allen, & Seaman, 2018). Additionally, while there is a growing literature on the implications of online graduate degrees for the IT field (Alqurashi, 2016; Goodman, Melkers, & Pallais, 2019; Grzeda & Miller, 2009; Kim et al., 2018), much remains to be learned about students' goal orientations in technical disciplines and how these degrees fit into their careers. Questions arise of how an online graduate degree program in computer science could affect the career pathways of different demographic groups. Computer science is one of the disciplines in which women and non-Asian racial/ethnic minorities are severely underrepresented (National Science Board, 2018) and greater access to advanced education in computing could provide an accelerated pathway to IT careers for these groups.

3. Data & methods
3.1. Data
The data for this study originate from a 2017 survey of the first cohort of students enrolled in the Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) degree program at the Georgia Institute of Technology (“Georgia Tech”). (To clarify, the research team is not affiliated with the OMSCS program but is conducting research on student experiences and outcomes of the program.) Launched in 2015, OMSCS offers an identical program and degree to Georgia Tech’s 8th-ranked traditional graduate program in computing, but in an online, asynchronous format (OMSCS, 2021, US News &#38; World Report, 2018). The OMSCS program has won multiple accolades, including recognition from President Obama (Obama, 2015; Georgia Institute of Technology, 2013) for its unique combination of academic excellence, accessibility, and affordability (total tuition under $7,000). The OMSCS program has a preference in admissions for former computer science majors with an undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or above, but also admits students with diverse professional and educational backgrounds, with a general goal of admitting all students who are likely to be successful in the program. As this is an online, asynchronous program, students need not be physically located in the United States, and the program also does not sponsor student visas for international students or require Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores.

The primary purpose of our 2017 survey was to examine student experience in the program, with a focus on issues of women in computer science. Questions addressed motivation to enroll, alternatives considered, and intention to complete the program. The survey was designed and administered using Qualtrics survey software to a sample of 2761 enrolled students, from a total population list of 6683. We oversampled women and underrepresented minorities, including all female, Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Native American students. The remainder of the sample was composed of randomly-selected students (white and Asian men). The decision to oversample women and underrepresented minorities in this survey was prompted by calls from within the computing discipline to study the motivations and experiences of underrepresented groups in computing (Corbett & Hill, 2015; Fisher & Margolis, 2002; Main & Schimpf, 2017). Women's career advancement in the IT field has long been considered a particularly important and challenging question, affected by social, structural, and intersectional factors (Ahuja, 2002; Beyer, 2014; Blackburn, 2017). More recently, scholars have advocated for an intersectional approach when examining women's motivations to study computer science (Lehman, Newhouse, & Sax, 2020; Lehman, Sax, & Zimmerman, 2016; Varma, 2010). Thus, we conducted a population sample of women and underrepresented minorities in hopes of being able to address critical issues in the computer science discipline, which required a large sample of underrepresented groups.

Each student in the sample was personally invited to participate in the study via a unique link provided in an email solicitation. The survey and protocol were reviewed and approved by the Georgia Tech Institutional Review Board (IRB). The overall survey response rate was 32.5% (899 responses), which is within the acceptable range for surveys of students (Christensen et al., 2013; Nulty, 2008; Petrovčič, Petrič, & Manfreda, 2016). From these responses, a consistent dataset of 849 observations was obtained for regression analysis. There were no significant differences in the rates at which women and minority groups responded to the survey. Survey data were then merged with institutional and demographic data obtained from the program; such as student country of origin, gender, race/ethnicity, and enrollment date.

3.2. Analytical methods
To address our research question, we conducted a series of regression models using Logistic (logit) and Multinomial Logistic (mlogit) regressions. The logit models examine students' primary post-graduation career goal (or motivation for pursuing an online graduate degree in computer science). The multinomial logistic regressions (Andriole, Klingensmith, & Jeffe, 2006; Law, 2010) directly compare the characteristics of students between our various career goal groups. As part of this analysis, we partitioned our models by age to observe whether there are separate patterns for older and younger students. Initial descriptive statistical analysis was useful in understanding response patterns and overall composition of the student group.

3.3. Variables
The following variables were used in our analysis. All variables are derived directly from survey and enrollment data. The variables are described below.

3.3.1. Dependent variable
Post-graduation career goal: Pursuing college education is an investment in human capital which is only made if the expected benefits outweigh the cost associated with education. In this case, we define “expected benefit” as the career outcome expectations of students who chose to enroll in the online master's program. These outcome expectations may be comprised of various career trajectories, including career entry (e.g., finding a new job), advancement (e.g., seeking promotion or a new job), and stability (e.g., maintaining one's job) (Ojala et al., 2021). Although a master's degree is often considered as a terminal credential, we wanted to understand whether students really perceive the degree as a standalone career investment or as an instrument for a continued educational path. We created four separate binary dependent variables based on responses to the following survey question: [What do you hope to do following graduation? (Please select one) Keep the same job I have now, Be promoted to another job, Find a new job in computing, Apply for a doctoral degree, or Other (please specify)]. “Other” responses were coded by two doctoral students. Of these, fifteen responses were determined to fit in one of the other four categories and were recoded by consensus of the coders. The remaining “other” responses were not used in the regression analysis due to the varied nature of these responses (although they are useful descriptively).

3.3.2. Independent variables
Our interest in goals necessitates the inclusion of variables to address varying levels of computing-specific human capital, student status, and individual characteristics.

Computing human capital: education: Education is one of the most-widely used operationalizations of human capital (Ballout, 2007; Hostetler et al., 2007; Judge et al., 2010; Wayne, Liden, Kraimer, & Graf, 1999). In our study, we focus on the student's educational human capital specific to computing, which is operationalized as their subject area of their bachelor's degree. Based on survey responses, respondent undergraduate degrees were coded in one of three categories: computer science, other STEM majors, and non-STEM. In the regression models, non-STEM majors serve as the reference group.

Computing human capital: work experience: IT professionals build and strengthen their technical skills and competencies through learning by doing, which is why work experience in computing serves as a particular good measure of human capital for this population (Mithas & Krishnan, 2008). Professional human capital specific to computing is based on respondents' indication of whether they have ever been employed in the IT profession and/or if they are currently employed in an IT job. While presently employed students possess work experience that may shape their post-graduation goals (Yoo & Huang, 2013), they also face additional professional and personal barriers to obtaining a graduate degree (Osam, Bergman, & Cumberland, 2016). In the regression models, those without any computing job experience are the reference group. Variation of human capital by race and gender are also presented below in the descriptive results (Table 2).

Time in program: Research indicates that career goals and interests do not remain stable over the course of the degree program experience (Roach & Sauermann, 2017). In order to control for any changes that may have occurred over the students' course of study, we also add a variable for semesters enrolled in the program.

Demographics: Given the underrepresentation of women and certain minorities in computing and related challenges they experience (Corbett & Hill, 2015; Fox & Kline, 2016) and calls to examine intersectional effects in computing (Lehman et al., 2020, Lehman et al., 2016; Varma, 2010), we include a series of demographic variables for gender, race/ethnicity and age. Given the international student population in this graduate degree program and potential cross-cultural effects, we further include a variable for citizenship (Flere & Lavrič, 2008; Fries-Britt, Johnson, & Burt, 2013; Pang & Schultheiss, 2005). We also code for whether a student is on a temporary visa or no visa (located outside of the US). In the regressions, white, male US citizens are the reference group.

4. Results
4.1. Descriptive results
4.1.1. Respondents
Descriptive statistics for all variables are provided in Table 1. Given the general underrepresentation of women and people of color in computing, our study deliberately oversampled for women and underrepresented minorities, which is reflected in the demographic characteristics of our respondent group. Asian students make up a plurality (37%) of our respondents, with whites being the next largest group (32%), and the remainder comprised of Hispanic/Latino (12%), Black (11%), and multiracial (7%) students. Our respondents are mostly male (66%), although less so than the computing field in general. Additionally, the women in our respondent group are much more likely to be Asian and much less likely to be an underrepresented minority than the men. Just under half (49%) of students are US citizens and an additional 16% are US permanent residents, with the remainder (35%) either temporary visa-holders or overseas students. Student age ranges from 22 to 68, with a mean of 34.5 and a standard deviation of 7.82.

4.1.2. Career goals and student background
Results show that, across our set of respondents, the most common goal is to find a new job in computing (40%), followed by getting promoted (24%) and staying in one's current job (21%). While this degree is primarily training students for the workplace and, therefore, considered to be a terminal degree, a subset of students indicate their intention to use the degree as a stepping stone to obtaining a PhD (10%). There was no significant gender variation in these post-graduation goals.

Regarding education, just under half (47%) of respondents have undergraduate degrees in computer science. Most of the remainder have bachelor's degrees in other STEM disciplines (42%), with a small number (11%) holding non-STEM bachelor's degrees. Regarding work experience, the majority of students (71%) have a current job in computing, although this is true more for men than for women (79% as compared to 57%). Unsurprisingly, we found that computer science majors are more likely to have computing job experience than non-STEM majors.

Interestingly, more women (15% as compared to 6% for men) have held a past computing job, but are not currently working in computing. In addition, slightly more than one-quarter of women (28%) and fewer men (15%) enter the program with no computing job experience. These figures reflect the diversity of student backgrounds and non-traditional admissions policies noted earlier.

Given the demographic makeup of the online master's program and our interest in how underrepresented groups view the potential career outcomes of the online graduate degree, we also examine the computing human capital variables by race/ethnicity. As shown in Table 2, white women, Asian men, and especially Asian women are more likely to have no computing job experience at all, and less likely than white men to have a current job in computing. For citizenship effects, we found that temporary visa holders and overseas aliens are less likely to have current computing jobs.

4.2. Regression results
Our primary interest is in understanding student motivation for earning an online graduate degree, particularly as it applies to advancing or changing their career. Given that our focusis in the graduate-school setting, which may attract both relatively new baccalaureate graduates and mid-career workers, we also consider the motivation of older graduate students.

We first examine the factors that explain the likelihood of respondents having any one of four possible career goals (Table 3) using a series of logistic regression models. Each column shows the odds ratios of having each of the four categories of career goals (stay in current job, be promoted, get a new job in computing, and get a PhD). Results show that while educational human capital in computing (an undergraduate degree in computer science) has no significant effects in any of the models, human capital gained through work experience does. Students with a current job in computing are more likely to want to stay in their current job (odds ratio = 2.57, p < .01), more likely to want to be promoted (odds ratio = 2.62, p < .001), and much less likely to want to find a new job in computing (odds ratio = 0.31, p < .001) than those with no computing job experience. Respondents who have spent more time in the program are more likely to want to retain their current job (odds ratio = 1.25, p < .001), and less likely to want a new job (odds ratio = 0.92, p < .05).

*** p < .001, ** p < .01, * p < .05.

Demographically, our results show almost no statistical differences in whether a graduate student is likely to have any one of these career goals. There are two exceptions: First, Black students are much less likely than white students to want to stay in their current position (odds ratio = 0.38, p < .01). Second, temporary US residents and overseas students are less likely than US citizens to have promotion as a post-graduation goal (odds ratio = 0.58, p < .01) and much more likely to want to pursue a PhD after they graduate (odds ratio = 2.50, p < .01). This suggests that these individuals may see the online master's program as a pathway into the US workforce and/or American PhD programs. Additionally, as age increases, students are more likely to want to stay in their current position (odds ratio = 1.03, p < .05).

We also recognize that career and life stage may matter in how students consider the utility of an online graduate degree. To address this, we re-ran the models from Table 3, but partitioned the data by age, above and below the age of 35 (Table 4). We selected this age as it roughly represents ten years in the workforce. Many of the earlier results drop off or are weaker when the data are partitioned, and educational human capital remains to have no effect. The most notable result here is that younger students (under thirty-five) with a current job in computing are more likely to hope to be promoted after they complete their degree (odds ratio = 3.37, p < .01), while older students with current jobs in computing do not. Among students with current jobs in computing, the odds ratios for keeping one's job are roughly the same for both age groups (under 35: odds ratio = 2.76, p < .05; 35 and above: odds ratio = 2.55, p < .05). The likelihood of seeking a new job in computing is also similar for both younger (odds ratio = 0.29, p < .001) and older (odds ratio = 0.35, p < .001) students with current computing jobs. However, race/ethnicity shows some new and different effects. Among older adult students, Asians are much less likely than whites to want to keep their current job (odds ratio = 0.44, p < .05). At the same time, younger Blacks are even less likely to want to stay in their current jobs (odds ratio = 0.12, p < .01). Younger multiracial students are more than twice as likely as whites to want to get a new job in computing after their degree (odds ratio = 2.57, p < .05). Citizenship shows no effects among older students but does in the younger cohort. Younger permanent residents are almost twice as likely as US citizens to seek to pursue a new computing job (odds ratio = 1.99, p < .05). Temporary visa holders and overseas students are more likely than US citizens to indicate their intent to pursue a PhD after completion of their degree (odds ratio = 2.39, p < .05) and less likely to want to be promoted (odds ratio = 0.58, p < .05).

The above findings examine the odds of having a specific goal with all other possible goals as the reference. We were also interested in a comparative view, to understand whether a student is more likely to expect one career goal over another. To analyze relationships between goals, we conducted a series of multinomial logistic (mlogit) regressions (Table 5), which compare the odds of having various goals one to one against each other (i.e. one potential goal will be the base ‘0’ case and another will be the alternative ‘1’ case in a series of binary logistic regressions).

*** p < .001, ** p < .01, * p < .05.

Results show significant differences for both professional human capital and demographics. First, for human capital, respondents with an undergraduate degree in computing are three times more likely to indicate interest in pursuing a PhD rather than finding a new job in computing (odds ratio = 3.14, p < .05). From the earlier results, we know that this is driven by the non-US citizens in the study. Students with a current job in computing are much less likely to want to find a new job than to be promoted (odds ratio = 0.26, p < .001) or stay in their current job (odds ratio = 0.25, p < .001). They are also more likely to want to get a PhD than get a new job in computing (odds ratio = 2.27, p < .05). However, professional experience in computing does not seem to influence the relative likelihood of seeking to stay in one's current job, be promoted, or aspiring to a PhD, relative to one another.

In terms of demographics, the strongest results are specific to Black students. Results show that they are several times more likely to expect to either find a new job (odds ratio = 2.53, p < .05), be promoted (odds ratio = 2.77, p < .05), or pursue a PhD (odds ratio = 3.60, p < .05) following their online master's degree than to stay in their current position. Other demographic groups (race/ethnicity or gender) show no significant differences. In terms of citizenship effects, US permanent residents are more likely to want to find a new job in computing, rather than stay in their current position after the master's degree (odds ratio = 1.90, p < .05). US temporary residents and overseas students, on the other hand, are two to four times more likely to indicate the goal of pursuing a PhD than any other potential goal (vs keep my current job: odds ratio = 2.52, p < .01; vs be promoted: odds ratio = 3.43, p < .001; vs find a new job in computing: odds ratio = 2.01, p < .05). They are also more interested in finding a new job in computing than being promoted (odds ratio = 1.71, p < .05). Finally, as age increases, students are more likely to want to stay in their current jobs, when compared to being promoted (odds ratio = 0.97, p < .05) or finding a new job in computing (odds ratio = 0.97, p < .05). Older students are also more likely to want to pursue a PhD than to want to seek a new job in computing (odds ratio = 1.03, p < .05).

5. Discussion and conclusion
5.1. Discussion of major findings
The growing IT industry presents career opportunities for a new generation, but also for those who are interested in and able to adapt to the technical needs of this labor market. As universities develop and launch programs to meet a growing market of professionals (Goodman, Melkers, & Pallais, 2019) interested in pursuing graduate degrees in technical fields, understanding prospective students' educational goals will help in the conception of these programs and the diverse interests of students who enroll in them. This study begins to address the utility of online graduate degrees in technical fields, an emerging form of degree with clear technical and social advantages but little precedent (Banks, 2017; Goodman, Melkers, & Pallais, 2019; National Science Board, 2018). Not surprisingly, we find that working adult students' decision to enroll in an online graduate degree program in computer science is most commonly motivated by the opportunity to build their human capital for the purpose of career advancement, but in different ways. We find two distinct student markets: one for career mobility, including job advancement and/or career change, and the other for skill building without consideration for mobility.

Graduate education in science and engineering facilitates job mobility and professional advancement (Calitz, Greyling, & Cullen, 2017). Students with a postgraduate degree in IT gain a competitive advantage in the computing job market, guaranteeing them higher pay (Mithas & Krishnan, 2008) and access to specialized and senior leadership positions (Calitz, Greyling, & Cullen, 2017; Kappelman et al., 2016). Indeed, our descriptive findings seem to render the traditional image of mobility, where the majority of students want either a promotion or a new job post-graduation. However, the goal of using the degree to advance in the labor market seems to be less applicable for some groups. In particular, students with considerable computing human capital (i.e. students who are currently working in computer science) are no more likely to seek a promotion than to want to stay in their current job, and less likely to have a goal of finding a new job in computing.

Serving a mid-career student body does present different perspectives on the value of a master's degree and the human capital development it presents. As individuals age, promotion and finding a new position become less important than keeping one's current job. While research suggests that adult students pursue graduate degrees to expand their skills (Peters & Daly, 2013), the question arises as to what end the degree is being used. Our results seem to imply that skill-building may not only be geared towards job mobility; but also job maintenance, staying relevant in the workforce, or intrinsic rewards that we do not yet fully understand. These results underscore the importance of not only examining these motivations more broadly, but also doing so taking different career stages into account. Future research should unpack how intrinsic and extrinsic motivational aspects factor into the decisions to return to graduate school, including how students might adjust their career goals over the course of their career and degree program.

Notably, our focus on human capital development within the context of computer science illustrates unique characteristics relevant to graduate program development. IT is no longer an industry limited to computing. Instead, IT, and the skilled workforce it requires, has been described as “pervasive,” across multiple industry types: from computing, to health care, to construction, to energy, and even the arts (Deloitte, 2019; Schatsky, Camhi, & Dongre, 2018). As demands for contextualized IT skills within these industries grow, so may demand for advanced training in computing in those sectors' workforces. Our results suggest opportunities and interest for mid-career entry into IT may be an important motivating factor for a subset of prospective graduate students. These results suggest an opportunity for online master's degrees in increasing access and developing substantive diversity in the IT field, particularly for graduate education. But, this opportunity also presents a challenge. As industry-diversity among graduate program applicants increases, many students may enter the online master's degree program without an undergraduate degree in computer science or any prior computing job experience. The diversity in student backgrounds might be an achievement of the online degree format, which is associated with lower barriers to access to graduate education (Deming et al., 2015; Goodman, Melkers, & Pallais, 2019; Yoo & Huang, 2013).

Computing is one of the least demographically diverse STEM disciplines. Our study also examined motivation to pursue the computing graduate degree across demographic groups, with some interesting results. With industry/professional diversification (discussed above), also comes demographic diversity. Our results show that more women than men are entering the master's program in computing without an undergraduate degree or work experience in computing. Some distinctions by race also emerged in our findings. Job mobility appears to be an extremely common goal among Black students, with our results showing that they are especially unlikely to want to use an online master's degree to stay in their current job, strongly preferring any other goal. Thus, online degrees might offer Black students the opportunity to both move up the career ladder into higher-paying and more senior jobs in technology and to enter the computing workforce from other fields. Not all implications are as clear, however. We did not find any significant differences between men and women or between Hispanics and whites in their career goals. This is puzzling, particularly considering that some studies have suggested gender differences in motivational orientations for pursuing graduate education (Flynn, 2006; Hostetler et al., 2007). Additionally, the low number of female students from underrepresented minorities in the study group did not allow for the examination of interaction effects. Further research is needed to fully understand race and gender effects in online graduate education, and especially their interactions. Additionally, future studies should continue to explore the relative strengths of human capital and race/gender effects in influencing career goals for graduate students.

5.2. Implications for practice
The diversity of human capital and reasoning for seeking an online master's degree in computer science pose significant challenges, but also opportunities, for program administrators and instructors. If programs such as this one are successful in continuing to attract demographically and professionally diverse students, one of the main challenges will be to design courses and programs such that they promote student engagement by meeting the needs and objectives of all learners. One of the foundational principles of effective instructional design – whether online or in-person – lies in identifying and addressing the learning expectations and needs of students. The identification of student objectives and learner characteristics, in turn, determines the program curriculum, course content, and learning support structures to facilitate engagement and persistence (Ambrose, Bridges, DiPietro, Lovett, & Norman, 2010; Song, Singleton, Hill, & Koh, 2004; Stavredes & Herder, 2014). The attractiveness of careers in the rapidly expanding IT industry shapes these objectives in ways that matter for instructional design. Moreover, as we have seen in our study, online programs may diversify the makeup of students in terms of learning skills (i.e. human capital) and learning goals (i.e. post-graduation career goal) such that meeting this instructional design principle becomes more difficult in online than in traditional settings. For example, research suggests that adult students feel motivated to learn and are more likely to persist if the course content is relevant and applicable to their jobs (Littenberg-Tobias & Reich, 2020; Park & Choi, 2009). Yet, depending on where students are at in their professional development (e.g. job status, industry sector, work experience) and what they hope to achieve with an online graduate degree (e.g. job entry versus job advancement), they define and determine ‘job-relevancy’ very differently. From an instructional design perspective, this creates the challenge to engage early career-students who seek to establish their knowledge and skillset while, at the same time, appeal to (professionally) more advanced adults who may quickly feel that course content is too elementary or outdated. Thus, to support adult learning and minimize dropouts in online degree programs, careful attention should be given to the development of courses and course portfolios that facilitate interaction with course content and satisfaction with the online courses for all learners (Choi & Park, 2018).

Another challenge arises as to how to ensure the persistence and success of students who are seeking to use an online master's degree (in computer science) to transition into the (computing) workforce. Students with less experience and prior training in – in our case – computing may experience frustrations and, thus, may be more likely to withdraw from courses or programs entirely (Rovai, 2003). These issues may be further exacerbated among underrepresented groups who are already experiencing other barriers to their success (Beyer, 2014; Fletcher et al., 2017; National Academy of Sciences et al., 2007). Therefore, consideration must be given to clarify student readiness and offer preparatory courses that teach students foundational knowledge and skills for programs that seek to enable graduate-entry into the job market (Kebritchi, Lipschuetz, & Santiague, 2017). However, this is not to say that prior professional experience and training relevant to the degree program always facilitates learning. Prior knowledge can be inaccurate or misconceived, serving not only as a filter for learning but as an obstacle to participation and persistence (Ambrose et al., 2010). A study on student persistence in MOOCs revealed that students with pre-existing misconceptions can be overly optimistic about their knowledge as well as their past and expected future success in the course, all of which present greater hurdles to persistence than lacking subject matter knowledge (Chen, Sonnert, Sadler, Sasselov, & Fredericks, 2019). Therefore, instructors should assess the amount and type of prior knowledge that students bring into the program, including misconceptions.

5.3. Limitations
There are a number of limitations to our study and our findings should be regarded in the light of these issues. This study was conceived and executed prior to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has profoundly affected higher education and the state of online teaching and learning (Crick, Knight, Watermeyer, & Goodall, 2020; Kamal, 2020; Watermeyer, Crick, Knight, & Goodall, 2020). Early indicators show large increases in enrollment of online graduate degree programs (for example an increase of 23% at Arizona State University) and other established leaders in online graduate education from fall 2019 to fall 2020 (Blumenstyk, 2018). However, it is critical that we acknowledge the distinction between purpose-designed online education programs like the one considered here and emergency online teaching as experienced during the pandemic (Bond, 2020; Hodges, Moore, Lockee, Trust, & Bond, 2020). We firmly believe that it is too early to say what trends from emergency online teaching will persist and have a long-term effect on online education.

Additionally, our research is based on a student sample from a single online degree program at a single US institution. While this is a large program, comprising a discernible percentage of the US graduate student body in computer science (National Science Board, 2018), our work should be viewed as somewhat exploratory given the (large) single institution study and other limits of our data. While online education has existed for decades, fully online graduate degree programs are still relatively new, particularly in STEM, and deserve further study. Second, as an exploratory survey, our findings are based on a limited set of measures that do not fully capture the complexity of motivational aspects of students pursuing an online graduate degree. Finally, and related, given that some students are not interested in career mobility following their degree completion, it is not clear what value the degree holds when staying in one's position. Additional research should address the nuances of intrinsic values of graduate education for mid-career adults.
