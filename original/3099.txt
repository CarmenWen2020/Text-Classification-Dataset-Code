Concept mapping has been employed as a promising tool to facilitate group learning and interaction mainly in the classroom. Computer- and web-based applications provide plenty of opportunities to extend concept mapping mediated group learning to online environments. Nevertheless, the effects of concept mapping on group learning and interaction may vary with the nature of group tasks and other factors. This study investigated the effects of web-based collaborative concept mapping on group interaction in two task situations: concept-oriented task and design-oriented task. Web-based collaborative concept mapping was used to mediate small group learning among college students in an online environment. The findings revealed that there were differences in the effects of collaborative concept mapping on group interaction between the two task situations; collaborative concept mapping functioned more effectively in facilitating group interaction in the concept-oriented task situation than in the design-oriented task situation in several ways.

1. Introduction
Collaborative learning, whereby two or more people engage in the learning process together to achieve the learning goal (Dillenbourg, 1999), has been widely advocated in educational practice. The rationale underlying collaborative learning is that knowledge is a social construct and that social interaction plays a fundamental role in the process of cognitive development (Vygotsky, 1978). Collaborative learning occurs not only in face-to-face environments, but more in online and blended settings by virtue of various digital media and communication tools (e.g., online forums, wikis, blogs, and videoconferencing). In general, computer- and web-based applications are increasingly transforming the way of learning and collaboration by allowing people to access information and communicate with others without time and distance constraints, by facilitating knowledge sharing and co-construction through flexible media, and by enabling learners to take active control of learning and interaction (Kreijns et al., 2003, Stahl et al., 2006).

Collaborative learning may take place in various forms, such as peer tutoring, team work, and communities of practice (Johnson, 1981, Kreijns et al., 2003, Lave and Wenger, 1991, Slavin, 1980). Among them, small group learning, i.e., learning taking place among a small number of participants, preferably with three to five members in a group, has been widely applied in educational practice and has attracted constant attention in educational research (Cohen, 1994, Lou et al., 2001, Webb, 2009). Small group learning is found to be effective in improving academic achievement, promoting positive affect (attitudes, motivation, and lower anxiety), and achieving positive social effects (Kirschner et al., 2009, Kutnick et al., 2008, Springer et al., 1999, Tolmie et al., 2010).

In small group learning contexts, interaction among students has been identified as a key factor in determining the benefits that students can gain from the collaborative learning process (Baines et al., 2009, Cohen, 1994, Springer et al., 1999, Webb, 1989). In addition to information sharing and social communication, students working in a group need to engage in a variety of interactions including cognitive elaboration, argumentation and negotiation, and the social construction of knowledge through joint effort. However, productive interaction or true collaboration among students working in groups is not easy to happen, which limits the value of group work in educational practice (Baines et al., 2009, Slavin, 2009, Webb, 2009). The ways to support group interaction have been explored from different perspectives such as structuring the interaction process, ensuring equity in interaction, the training of students, and the support of teachers (Cohen, 1994, Lou et al., 2001). Moreover, ignoring the social-emotional aspect of group interaction was identified as a pitfall for interaction in computer-supported collaborative learning environments (Kreijns et al., 2003, Rourke et al., 1999). Recent work has paid attention to intersubjective meaning-making in the context of joint activity in group learning, where visual representation tools such as concept maps and diagrams have been utilized to communicate complex ideas and maintain a shared focus on group discussion (Fischer et al., 2002, Suthers, 2006).

Concept mapping is a way of representing knowledge in graphical formats, mainly by using paper and pen or computer-based tools. In a concept map, ideas are represented as nodes and the relationships between them as links with descriptive labels (Novak & Musonda, 1991). By representing information both verbally and spatially, concept maps may enable more meaningful representation and efficient cognitive processing of complex issues than text messages alone (Wang, Wu, Kinshuk, Chen, & Spector, 2013). Accordingly, concept mapping has been promoted as a rich tool for knowledge representation and communication (Nesbit & Adesope, 2006) as well as for assessing learners' understanding of integrated knowledge (Filiz et al., 2015, Ruiz-Primo and Shavelson, 1996, Tsai et al., 2001). Recent research promoted the use of concept mapping to address the underlying ‘epistemic chaos’ in curriculum design and pedagogic practice in universities and professional education (Kinchin, 2015).

Collaborative concept mapping through joint effort has been found to support group cognitive processes by helping students to maintain a shared focus during group interaction (Roth and Roychoudhury, 1993, van Boxtel et al., 2002), elaborate conflicts and reasoning, shape discourses to reach shared understanding, and co-construct propositions (Chiu et al., 2000, Gao et al., 2013). Moreover, collaborative concept mapping fosters group metacognitive processes by maintaining shared awareness of previous ideas, evaluating understanding, and monitoring gaps in solutions (Koufou, Ergazaki, Komis, & Zogza, 2014); and facilitate group motivational-emotional experiences in collaborative learning and lower participants' anxiety (Czerniak & Haney, 1998).

On the other hand, the effects of concept mapping on collaborative learning are found to vary with the nature of groups tasks, learners' characteristics, and external assistance or instructional strategies (Adesope and Nesbit, 2010, Cheng et al., 2014, Gao et al., 2007). The nature of group tasks has been recognized to be of great importance in shaping group interaction in collaborative learning contexts (Cohen, 1994, Rico and Cohen, 2005, van Boxtel et al., 2002). Low-level cooperation tasks often involve the simple sharing of information or division of labor, and primarily result in discourse relating to information exchange, whereas high-level cooperation tasks often require interdependence among the participants to solve ill-structured problems, and result in reciprocal discourse such as task planning, decision making, and implementation (Cohen, 1994, Hertz-Lazarowitz, 1989). However, less is known about how the nature of group tasks may influence the effects of collaborative concept mapping on group learning and interaction, which is crucial to realizing the potential of concept mapping in group learning contexts. Although concept mapping has been widely used in collaborative conceptual learning tasks, it has also been employed to support problem-solving tasks by a few studies (Engelmann and Hesse, 2010, Gijlers and de Jong, 2013, Kolloffel et al., 2011, Slof et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2013). Learners were asked to construct concept maps to integrate ideas or represent group members' knowledge to support the problem-solving task; the results showed the effects of concept mapping in enhancing knowledge achievement, group interaction, and task performance. Nevertheless, there is a lack of comparison of concept mapping mediated group learning and interaction between conceptual learning tasks and problem-solving tasks. It is unknown whether there would be significant differences in the effects of concept mapping between the two types of tasks.

Further, traditional collaborative concept mapping is often performed along with face-to-face discussion by a group of learners when they draw a concept map together on one piece of paper or in one computer. The Internet has substantially expanded the environment for collaborative learning and concept mapping. It enables learners to co-create, co-edit, and share digital or web-based concept maps more easily (Cheng et al., 2014, Gijlers and de Jong, 2013). Moreover, advanced digital concept mapping tools like Cmap (http://cmap.ihmc.us/) provide additional functionality allowing learners to add information to describe a concept in the map. Such tools also allow learners to conduct online discussion and share learning resources while constructing concept maps. Nevertheless, few studies have examined the use of digital or web-based collaborative concept mapping and its effects on group learning and interaction in online environments.

2. The present study
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of web-based collaborative concept mapping on group interaction in an online environment in two task situations: a concept-oriented task and a design-oriented task. The two task situations were selected as common practice in many educational programs. A concept-oriented task is one that requires conceptual understanding of a given topic or problem, while a design-oriented task is one that requires both conceptual and procedural knowledge to solve a problem (Jonassen, 2000, Rittle-Johnson et al., 2001). Collaborative concept-oriented tasks often involve sharing information and knowledge, and combining members' contributions to produce a final product, during which members tend to have loose cooperation. Collaborative design-oriented tasks usually require intensive cooperation, whereby members interact closely to determine appropriate plans and take relevant actions to solve problems (Hertz-Lazarowitz, 1989).

This paper presents an empirical study with college students in online collaborative learning environments. The study aimed to answer the following research question:

How does web-based collaborative concept mapping affect group interaction in a concept-oriented task and in a design-oriented task? Are there any differences in the effects of web-based collaborative concept mapping between the two types of tasks?

In this study, the effects of web-based collaborative concept mapping on group interaction were explored in terms of cognitive, metacognitive, and motivational-emotional dimensions, which were identified as the essential aspects of group learning processes in the literature. Group interaction or group process was defined as the behavior or interaction patterns among group members (Jehn & Shah, 1997). To understand and facilitate interactional processes in computer-supported collaborative learning contexts, a variety of frameworks and taxonomies have been proposed. The community of inquiry (CoI) model outlines three essential elements of educational transactions in an online learning community: cognitive presence, which refers to learners constructing understanding; social presence, which refers to learners presenting themselves socially and emotionally; and teaching presence, which refers to learners managing and coordinating learning activities (Garrison and Anderson, 2003, Traphagan et al., 2010). Other similar taxonomies categorize group learning activities evident in online discussion transcripts. For example, Veldhuis-Diermanse (2002) classified group learning activities into three classes: cognitive, metacognitive, and affective. Janssen, Erkens, Kanselaar, and Jaspers (2007) categorized students' collaborative activities into four types: task-related activities, social activities, coordinating or regulating task-related activities, and coordinating or regulating social activities. These frameworks have consistently outlined the essential aspects of group learning processes in three dimensions: group cognitive activities, group metacognitive activities, and group motivational-emotional activities (Cheng, Wang, & Mercer, 2014).

3. Method
The study employed a two-factor experimental design: study condition (concept mapping vs. non-concept mapping) and task type (concept-oriented task vs. design-oriented task). While discussion forums were used by students in both concept mapping and non-concept mapping conditions, a concept mapping tool, Cmap (http://cmap.ihmc.us/), was used by students in the concept mapping condition only, i.e., the experimental group. Students in both conditions were asked to perform both concept- and design-oriented tasks in small groups. The analyses were based on students' engagement in group interaction reflected in questionnaire surveys and their group discourse reflected in discussion messages, and students' comments on collaborative concept mapping collected from interviews.

The research question was explored in the following steps. First, to distinguish student performance between the concept mapping and non-concept mapping conditions in performing the concept-oriented task, the survey and discourse data from the concept-oriented task were analyzed to reveal the effects of concept mapping (a between-subject design). Second, a similar analysis was conducted for the design-oriented task. Third, in the concept mapping condition, the survey and discourse data from both concept- and design-oriented tasks were analyzed to distinguish between the two types of tasks (a within-subject design), and interview data were used to validate the quantitative assertions and provide further information.

3.1. Participants
The subjects were 80 (52 males, 28 females) Year-2 undergraduate students, who enrolled in the course “Website design and development”. Given the large class size, the course was delivered in three time slots per week, each for one sub-class of no more than 30 students. Students could select any one of the three time slots or sub-classes, all taught by the same teacher, with little interactions among the sub-classes. As a part of the requirement of the course, students were asked to use an online collaborative learning environment to complete three tasks in small groups.

There were two possible methods of assigning the three sub-classes to one of the two conditions: two sub-classes into the experimental condition and one sub-class into the control condition, or one sub-class into the experimental condition and two sub-classes into the control condition. In order to know more about student use of concept mapping, the first arrangement was chosen in this study. Within each sub-class, students were randomly assigned to triads or groups of four. Thus, two classes of 16 groups (52 students) were assigned to the concept mapping condition, and one class of 9 groups (28 students) to the non-concept mapping condition. The study received ethical approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee for Non-Clinical Faculties of the researchers' university.

3.2. Learning environments and materials
As suggested by the teacher, students were required to complete two concept-oriented tasks and one design-oriented task, each of which was relevant to a specific topic of the course. The course teacher and a researcher co-designed the tasks and assessment criteria. The first concept-oriented task was to conduct a survey of website headers by examining three to five websites of different types and analyze their header information, such as frequently used tags, properties of tags, the usage of tags, and the relationship between tags and usages. The second concept-oriented task was to carry out a review of HTML tags by classifying HTML tags, listing each tag's full name and syntax, and outlining the relationships among all kinds of tags. The design-oriented task, i.e., the third task, was to design a class website and report the design procedure.

In the concept mapping condition, students used the Cmap tool to perform the group tasks by drawing or co-editing web-based concept maps, initiating and responding to messages, and share learning resources (see Fig. 1). Each group was required to submit a concept map as a group product for each task. In the design-oriented task, students were required to use a concept map to discuss and depict the procedure of website development including planning, implementing, and testing, each with specific activities.

3.3. Procedure
The group learning tasks were in parallel with the course period. The first concept-oriented task started in the third week of an academic semester and the second concept-oriented task started in the fifth week, while the third task (design-oriented) began in the tenth week based on the course schedule. Students were given two weeks to complete each of the three tasks. Before the first task, a questionnaire survey was administered to collect the participants' general computer skills and communication skills in a self-reported way. A face-to-face demonstration of how to use the learning tool (Cmap or online forum) for conceptual task and design task was then provided to learners. Supporting materials including the use of the concept mapping tool, concept mapping skills, collaborative concept mapping procedures, and guidance for ethical group communication were also offered to all students to support their group learning.

Students were asked to use the given online environment to perform the three group tasks during out-of-class time due to the fact that they did not have much common time to get together for face-to-face discussion. During the task periods, there was generally no teacher involvement except for technical assistance. Two surveys using the same questionnaire were administered to all students, one at the end of the second concept-oriented task and the other at the end of the design-oriented task. Finally, interviews were held with several groups and the course teacher to collect their comments on the effects of collaborative concept mapping on group learning. There was no assessment of group task performance in order to avoid heavy workload for the participants.

3.4. Measurement and instrument
3.4.1. Questionnaire survey
In the pre-test survey, students' knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) were measured. The pre-test survey instrument consisted of the knowledge of cognition scale (17 items adopted form Schraw & Dennison, 1994), computer skills and communication skills (8 and 12 items respectively adapted from related studies (e.g., Association of College and Research Libraries, 2000, McCroskey and McCroskey, 1988), and attitudes towards online learning and small group learning (7 and 6 items respectively adapted from Wu (1999).

Moreover, a post-test questionnaire survey was used to measure student engagement in group interaction during the task completion process, according to a set of scales concerning cognitive, metacognitive, and motivational-emotional dimensions. The scale measuring cognitive processes in group learning comprised four components: information exchange (4 items; e.g., “In group learning, we freely expressed our opinions, thoughts, and feelings”), disputation (3 items; e.g., “When we disagreed with the opinions contributed by other members, we made counter-arguments”), exploration (5 items; e.g., “We challenged each other to solve problems through joint reasoning”), and convergence (2 items; e.g., “We discussed and concluded to reach a consistent solution”). The items were developed based on prior studies (Cheng et al., 2014, Hara et al., 2000, Jehn and Shah, 1997, Veldhuis-Diermanse, 2002, Wegerif et al., 1999).

The scale measuring metacognitive processes in group learning consisted of three parts: planning (2 items; e.g., “In group learning we made plans regarding strategies for fulfilling the tasks”), monitoring and adjustment (4 items; e.g., “During group learning we paid attention to the progress of our task”), and reflection (3 items; e.g., “At the end of each group task we reflected on the efficiency of our group cooperation”). The items were developed based on Marks, Mathieu, and Zaccaro (2001) and Zimmerman (2000).

The motivation scale was adapted from the Instructional Materials Motivational Survey (Keller, 2010) and consisted of 16 items divided into four subscales: attention, usefulness, confidence, and satisfaction. Examples of items are: “The learning program stimulated my curiosity” (attention), “I could relate the learning content to my own learning goal in the course” (usefulness), “The level of difficulty of the learning tasks was appropriate” (confidence), and “It was a pleasure to participate in the learning program” (satisfaction). The emotion scale comprised 15 items measuring enjoyment, pride, anxiety, and belongingness adapted from prior studies (Chiu et al., 2006, Pekrun et al., 2002). Sample items are: “I enjoy the small group learning” (enjoyment), “I am proud of what my group and I achieved in the group learning” (pride), “I felt nervous during the group learning” (anxiety), and “I have a sense of belongingness toward my group” (belongingness). A 5-point Likert scale was used for all the questionnaire items ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agreed).

3.4.2. Group discourse
The transcripts of students' discussions were coded into three broad dimensions: cognitive, metacognitive, and motivational-emotional, drawn from previous studies (Fischer et al., 2002, Tolmie et al., 2010, Webb, 2009, Wegerif et al., 1999). The cognitive dimension consists of the following categories: information exchange, disputation, exploration, and convergence. Information exchange was further divided into asking questions and providing information. The metacognitive dimension was divided into planning, monitoring, and reflection, based on previous studies (Marks et al., 2001, Winters and Azevedo, 2005, Zimmerman, 2000). The motivational-emotional dimension was coded as a broad category of learning experience drawn from prior studies (Jehn and Shah, 1997, Keller, 2010, Pekrun et al., 2002).

In this study, students initiated and built up many discussion threads. A discussion thread is a sequence of messages, with a focus message asking a question or presenting an opinion on a topic starting the discussion thread, and with relevant messages replying or responding to the focus message being posted to continue the discussion. Therefore, a discussion thread was the coding unit of analysis.

All the discussion threads posted by students in online discussions for all the group task sessions were gathered and prepared into four corpuses according to the study condition and task type. Based on previous literature (e.g., Soter et al., 2008, Wegerif et al., 1999) and a pre-analysis of the corpuses, a dictionary of words for automatic text analysis was built. The words in the dictionary were organized in accordance with the cognitive, metacognitive, and socio-emotional dimensions of group interaction and the sub-categories of learning activities in each dimension. The dictionary was verified manually using concordance analysis (i.e., keyword in contexts) using Antconc (Anthony, 2011). The concordance analysis was conducted to ensure that the search words in the dictionary were valid for representing the assumed categories of learning activities in students' discourses. All the search words in the dictionary were checked before they were selected as the indicative words.

Two coders involved in the coding work. Each of them made an indicative words dictionary according to the discourse messages. Then they met to merge their individual dictionary into a final one. The disagreement was resolved through face-to-face discussion. Based on the merged dictionary, the two coders performed the coding of discussion threads independently, and reached an acceptable level of agreement, with Cohen's Kappa = 0.705.

3.4.3. Interviews
To further understand the effects of collaborative concept mapping on group interaction from a learner's perspective, interviews were arranged with 7 groups of students randomly selected from 16 groups in the concept mapping condition. Interview questions were devised to collect students' open comments on the effects of collaborative concept mapping on all categories of group interaction. Examples of questions are: “How did collaborative concept mapping influence knowledge exchange within your group?” and “How did collaborative concept mapping influence your motivation and emotion for group interaction?” The interviews were carried out at the end of task period by a research assistant using online videoconferencing and lasted for 30 to 52 minutes for each group. Students' responses to were analyzed first by identifying a number of positive and negative comments on the effects of collaborative concept mapping on all categories of group interaction and then by categorizing the comments into a number of views shared by different groups.

Moreover, a face-to-face interview was arranged with the course teacher. The interview questions concerned the teacher's view of concept mapping-mediated group learning, changes among students as a result of collaborative concept mapping, and suggestions for improvement in future work. Similar to the coding and analysis procedures of discourse data, interview data were also coded by the two coders who reached a high degree of consensus, with Cohen's Kappa = 0.87.

3.5. Data analysis
To distinguish student performance between the concept mapping and non-concept mapping conditions, questionnaire data and discourse messages were analyzed. Given that participants assigned to the two study conditions were from independent units of a large class without interactions, independent samples t-test was performed for analysis. Levene's test was run to test the equality of variance across the samples. For those items violating the equal variances assumption, the t-test results after adjusting the degrees of freedom using the Welch-Satterthwaite method (Kohr & Games, 1974) were reported. For the within-subject comparison in the concept mapping condition, the differences in student performance between two types of tasks were examined using the t-test. Given the intertwined instead of hierarchical relationships between the group process variables (e.g., cognitive and meta-cognitive activities may influence motivational-emotional experience and vice versa), multilevel models for hierarchical analysis was not taken into account in the present study.

4. Results
4.1. Reliability and validity
The reliability of the scales measuring KSAs in the pre-test survey questionnaire varied from Cronbach's α value 0.84 to 0.96 in this study. Cronbach's α for the variables representing different categories of group interactional processes in the post-test survey questionnaire varied from 0.79 to 0.92. Detailed Cronbach's α value for each scale can be seen in the Appendix. The reliability analysis indicated that the questionnaires were highly reliable because all scales were approximately higher than 0.80. In addition, the validity of the questionnaires was verified so that unsuitable or ambiguous items could be modified or eliminated by domain experts. For the group discourse data, two coders independently coded all the 771 messages posted by students in performing the three tasks in the two study conditions. The two coders reached an acceptable level of agreement, with Cohen's Kappa = 0.705. The interview data were also coded and analyzed by the two coders, who reached a high degree of consensus, with Cohen's Kappa = 0.87.

4.2. Between-group equality
Students KSAs collected from the pre-test survey were analyzed to check whether there were differences in the students' prior knowledge, skills, and attitudes between the concept mapping and non-concept mapping groups. The one-way ANOVA results indicate that there were no significant differences for all the pre-test variables, as shown in Table 1.

4.3. Concept mapping vs. non-concept mapping (between-subject design)
The effects of concept mapping were examined by comparing the differences between the concept mapping and non-concept mapping conditions in the concept-oriented and the design-oriented tasks respectively.

4.3.1. Concept-oriented task
Table 2 provides the descriptive statistics of students' self-rated scores on engagement in the different categories of group interaction in performing the concept-oriented task, as well as the independent samples t-test results. The t-test results showed that students using concept mapping reported having experienced a significantly lower level of anxiety than those not using concept mapping (mean difference = − 0.607, t = − 2.168, df = 72, p < 0.05), with no significant differences in other categories of group interaction.

The t-test results showed that students not using concept mapping were engaged in more discussion involving information exchange than those using concept mapping (mean difference = − 0.373, t = − 5.764, df = 124, p < 0.01). Students using concept mapping were engaged more in three categories of interaction: disputation (mean difference = 0.037, t = 2.452, df = 97.226, p < 0.05), monitoring (mean difference = 0.166, t = 2.956, df = 123.795, p < 0.01) and reflection (mean difference = 0.135, t = 3.977, df = 81, p < 0.01) than those not using concept mapping. The results suggested that concept mapping leads to more interaction for disputation, monitoring, and reflection but less interaction for information exchange, in performing a concept-oriented task.

Table 4 outlines the descriptive statistics for students' engagement in the different categories of group interaction in performing the design-oriented task, and the independent samples t-test results. The t-test results showed that students not using concept mapping scored higher on the motivational-emotional categories including usefulness (mean difference = − 0.482, t = − 3.611, df = 39.859, p < 0.01), confidence (mean difference = − 0.476, t = − 2.991,df = 70, p < 0.01), satisfaction (mean difference = − 0.357, t = − 2.535, df = 39.209, p < 0.05), enjoyment (mean difference = − 0.452, t = − 3.210, df = 35.051, p < 0.01), pride (mean difference = − 0.418, t = − 3.148, df = 43.005, p < 0.01), and belongingness (mean difference = − 0.297, t = − 2.256, df = 44.675, p < 0.05) than those using concept mapping. The results suggest that concept mapping leads to less positive motivational-emotional experiences in performing a design-oriented task.

A total of 23 discussion threads were created by 16 groups using concept mapping and 11 discussion threads created by 9 groups not using concept mapping. Table 5 presents the descriptive statistics for the mean percentage of messages coded into each category of group interaction in a discussion thread, and the independent samples t-test results. The t-test results indicated that students not using concept mapping were engaged in more discussion involving asking questions (mean difference = − 0.116, t = − 2.340, df = 11.317, p < 0.05) and planning (mean difference = − 0.206, t = − 2.545, df = 32, p < 0.05) than those using concept mapping. The results suggest that concept mapping leads to less interaction involving question asking and task planning in performing a design-oriented task.

In summary, in performing a concept-oriented task, learners using concept mapping were found to engage in more interaction involving disputation, monitoring and reflection and to experience less anxiety than those not using concept mapping, but they were engaged in less interaction involving information exchange. In performing a design-oriented task, learners using concept mapping were found to engage in fewer positive motivational-emotional experiences and less interaction involving asking questions and task planning than those not using concept mapping. It seemed that concept mapping played different roles in the two types of tasks; therefore, we conducted a within-subject comparison to explore the differences in the effects of concept mapping between the two types of tasks.

4.4. Concept-oriented vs. design-oriented tasks using concept mapping (within-subject design)
Table 6 shows the t-test results based on questionnaire data indicating that the concept mapping students scored higher on confidence (mean difference = 0.373, t = 3.437, df = 103, p < 0.01), satisfaction (mean difference = 0.317, t = 2.719, df = 101.707, p < 0.01), enjoyment (mean difference = 0.404, t = 3.361, df = 103, p < 0.01), pride (mean difference = 0.294, t = 2.504, df = 102.457, p < 0.05), and belongingness (mean difference = 0.312, t = 2.646, df = 102.220, p < 0.01) in the concept-oriented task than in the design-oriented task. The results suggest that concept mapping as a group learning tool is more effective in promoting students' positive motivational and emotional experiences in a concept-oriented task than in a design-oriented task.

Table 7 shows the t-test results based on discourse data indicating that there was a significantly higher percentage of asking questions in the concept-oriented task than in the design-oriented task (mean difference = 0.087, t = 3.291, df = 103, p < 0.01). The result suggests that concept mapping as a group learning tool leads to more interaction in asking questions in a concept-oriented task than in a design-oriented task.

4.5.2. Interview with the teacher
The teacher claimed that collaborative concept mapping was particularly helpful for students to review and summarize the subject knowledge, especially in a collaborative way. He also commented that collaborative concept mapping could be used to help students to communicate and collaborate in the application of knowledge to practical tasks, although students might need additional instruction. Moreover, the teacher reported three main changes among students as a result of concept mapping-mediated group learning experience: improvement in teamwork skills, more positive attitudes towards learning, and enhanced ability to review and summarize knowledge. Concerning suggestions for improvement, the teacher proposed that communications among the groups could be improved via group presentation and peer assessment, and that formative assessment could be provided on students' concept maps during the task period.

5. Discussions
5.1. Effects of collaborative concept mapping (concept mapping versus non-concept mapping)
5.1.1. Collaborative concept mapping in the concept-oriented task situation
When conducting the concept-oriented task, with respect to the cognitive aspect, students in the concept mapping condition were committed to significantly more group discussion on disputation but less on information exchange. Concept mapping has been widely reported to be a rich tool for knowledge representation and communication (Adesope and Nesbit, 2010, Gao et al., 2007), thereby making it easier for group members to clarify and explain their ideas and refer to concepts and their relationships that were discussed at an earlier stage (Suthers & Hundhausen, 2003). This may lead to fewer discussion messages on information exchange, which is verified by the interview data. Several groups highlighted the efficiency of concept mapping in supporting information sharing and visual representation of knowledge, which helped them save text-based discussions for information exchange. On the other hand, by visually representing concepts and their relationships, concept maps can capture students' attention to conceptual learning activities (Kolloffel et al., 2011). Thus, students using concept maps made more disputations on concepts and their relationships. The interview results also revealed that many students found collaborative concept mapping helpful for clarification and elaboration in argument. In fact, previous studies have shown that the cooperative use of concept mapping can lead to a high level of group discourse such as externalization of on-task knowledge and conflict-oriented consensus building on task-relevant content (Fischer et al., 2002, van Boxtel et al., 2000).

With respect to the metacognitive aspect, concept mapping resulted in more group interaction involving monitoring and reflection. This benefit was also evidenced by students' interview responses. In terms of monitoring, group-based concept mapping helped learners keep track of their progress and performance, evaluate their subject knowledge, and make progressive improvement to accomplish the task. In other words, collaborative concept mapping fostered the monitoring of a group task by facilitating group awareness of task progress and on-task knowledge. In terms of reflection, many students mentioned that concept mapping stimulated them to search for additional relevant resources to improve their solutions. Some other studies have also reported that concept mapping empowers students to become aware of and reflect on shared understanding of previous ideas, monitor gaps in solutions, and evaluate knowledge (Czerniak and Haney, 1998, Suthers and Hundhausen, 2002, van Boxtel et al., 2000). Such reflection can direct group members' attention to their misconceptions, thereby correcting their understanding.

Regarding the motivational and emotional aspect, the survey revealed that students in concept mapping condition reported significantly less anxiety about the conceptual task. Concept mapping groups' more disputation, monitoring and reflection on the task indicated their higher efficacy. This might contribute to their lower anxiety, as it has been indicated that higher efficacy helps reduce anxiety (Czerniak & Haney, 1998). In addition, the interview data showed that many students enjoyed the graphical representation of concept maps, became motivated to study deeply, and improved their relationships with fellow group members via collaborative concept mapping, all of which helped them experience less anxiety during the learning process of the concept-oriented task. Similar findings are also evidenced in the study by Liu (2004).

5.1.2. Collaborative concept mapping in the design-oriented task situation
In terms of the cognitive aspect in the design-oriented task, concept mapping led to less interaction involving question asking. The plausible explanation for the fewer question asking activities in the concept mapping condition is that concept map can explicitly express an learner's ideas and make them easily understood by other group members (Novak & Musonda, 1991). Thus, learners did not need to ask too many questions about each other's ideas. The finding also supported the efficiency of concept mapping in explicitly representing information and ideas.

In terms of the metacognitive aspect, concept mapping led to significantly less interaction or discussion on task planning. Since concept map was employed to outline the procedure of website design and development, students did not need to discuss too much about the planning of the task. The interview records showed that several groups found concept mapping helpful for planning and labor division. In particular, one group claimed that concept mapping helped representing the details and procedure for the design task.

With respect to the motivational-emotional aspect, according to the survey results, students in concept mapping condition reported fewer positive motivational and emotional experiences, in terms of usefulness, confidence, satisfaction, enjoyment, pride, and belongingness. On the other hand, the interview results also show more negative than positive comments on using concept mapping in the design-oriented group task. One important reason was that some groups' concept maps focused on the conceptual issues instead of problem-solving procedures. Some students did not know how to use concept maps to guide their problem solving though instructions had been given before the experiment. Others indicated that concept map was limited in representing full information of the given problem. This may explain why students in the concept mapping condition reported significantly negative perceptions in usefulness, satisfaction, and enjoyment. Several groups stated that they felt less confident when using concept mapping to explore the design-oriented task. Given the difficulties experienced, students claimed the need for more instructional support on concept mapping with the design task. To address the problem, the teacher proposed to improve communications across the small groups by group presentation and peer assessment, and to provide formative assessment on concept mapping performance during the task period. In fact, the study by Stoyanov and Kommers (2008) also indicated that concept mapping alone was inadequate in supporting complex problem-solving especially for eliciting and representing the procedure of applying knowledge to practice.

5.2. Effects of task type (concept-oriented task versus design-oriented task)
The within-subject comparison revealed that task nature plays a significant role in determining the effects of collaborative concept mapping on group interaction. As a group learning tool, concept mapping functioned more effectively in facilitating group interaction in a concept-oriented task than in a design-oriented task, in terms of engaging students in asking questions and promoting positive motivational and emotional experiences. This finding seems to be predictable since the most important affordance of concept map is to represent concepts and their relationships. One possible reason for the low efficiency of concept mapping in guiding the design-oriented task is that it was inadequately used by the students as they were not quite familiar with using concept maps to guide problem solving though instructions had been given before the experiment. The inadequate use of concept mapping tools has also been reported by previous literature (Kolloffel et al., 2011). As evidenced in the interview responses, some students constructed concept maps to display concepts involved in website design instead of procedural knowledge. Students' inadequate use of concept mapping in the design-oriented task may contribute to their lower perceptions of motivational-emotional experiences. In addition, students in performing the design-oriented task were expected to focus on doing rather than on discussion, which might result in less group interaction reflected in the discussion records.

5.3. Summary and further discussion
Compared to no-concept mapping, concept mapping was advantageous in fostering group interaction in a concept-oriented task by promoting more beneficial interactions such as disputation, monitoring, and reflection; by reducing information exchange activity; and by lowering anxiety. On the other hand, compared to no-concept mapping, concept mapping was found to be inadequate in positive motivation and emotion in a design-oriented task, though it helped save discussions on task planning.

Further, this study found that there were differences in the effects of collaborative concept mapping on group interaction between the two types of tasks. Concept mapping functioned more effectively in supporting group interaction in a concept-oriented task than in a design-oriented task, in terms of engaging students in asking questions and promoting positive motivational and emotional experiences. In particular, students were found to experience difficulties in using concept mapping to explore ideas and solutions related to procedural knowledge for a design-oriented task, making them less engaged in group interaction to complete the task.

The low efficiency of collaborative concept mapping in the design-oriented task situation could be explained by students' unfamiliarity with or inadequate use of concept mapping to support problem solving. The finding can be further explained by the difference between the two types of tasks. A concept-oriented task differs from a design-oriented task in its task nature. The former focused on discussing relevant concepts and their relationships, while the latter involved planning, designing, and implementing a website in this study. Students focused on conceptual understanding and discussion in the concept-oriented task, while they engaged in knowledge application in the design-oriented task. A concept-oriented task requires conceptual understanding of a given topic or problem, while a design-oriented task requires both conceptual and procedural knowledge to solve a problem. Procedural knowledge, i.e., how the task can be accomplished through appropriate actions and methods, is usually tacit or not easy to express explicitly in a concept map, though crucial to the task. As suggested by previous literature (Stoyanov & Kommers, 2008), heuristics and techniques, such as problem solving instructions should complement the concept mapping tool to make it more effective in supporting problem-solving tasks (Stoyanov & Kommers, 2008). Other strategies such as role assignment, which was found to have positive effects on social-emotional experiences in web-based concept mapping mediated group learning (Cheng, Wang, & Mercer, 2014) can also be taken into account. These findings provide useful implications for research and practice in using collaborative concept mapping to support group learning and interaction.

5.4. Limitations of the study
This study was limited in several respects. First, there were some limitations regarding the group work design. During the learning program, students reported having experienced the technical problem in co-editing a concept map remotely by different members. Some students also mentioned the need of instructional support for their concept mapping with the design-oriented task. Second, in investigating the effects of collaborative concept mapping on shaping social interaction in group learning, human factors such as individual differences in learning style and personality were not taken into account in the study. Third, the unequal sample size in the concept mapping and non-concept mapping conditions (i.e., two classes versus one class), may contribute to the inequality of the variance in some of the discussion activities between the two conditions. Fourth, in the within-subject design, student performance in the latter task might be affected to some extent by the former task. It is possible that students had got used to build concept maps for conceptual learning, and had some difficulty adjusting their way of using concept mapping for problem solving tasks. Fifth, the interview was only administered to the concept mapping students rather than all students in the two conditions, resulting in a potential bias to the results. Finally, more objective measurements, for example student knowledge achievement could be examined. The limitations will be addressed in further studies.

6. Conclusion
This study explored the use and effects of web-based collaborative concept mapping in supporting group interaction in a web-based learning environment. The results of this study join the previous research to support the promising effects of concept mapping on group learning and interaction mainly in concept-oriented task situations. Collaborative concept mapping was advantageous in promoting group interaction in the concept-oriented task situation by enabling more interaction on disputation, monitoring, and reflection, by saving discussions on information exchange, and by promoting positive motivation and emotion and reducing anxiety. On the other hand, in the design-oriented task situation, though collaborative concept mapping helped save group interaction on task planning, learners experienced difficulties using concept maps to explore solutions or procedural knowledge for accomplishing the task, contributing to their lower perceptions of motivational and emotional experiences.

The findings of this study provide implications for research and practice in concept mapping mediated group learning and interaction in web-based learning environments. Given that concept mapping has been mainly used to articulate conceptual understanding, it seems not easy for students to use concept mapping for group learning and interaction in problem-solving situations, e.g., design-oriented tasks, which focus on knowledge application rather than conceptual understanding. Instructional guidance, for example on how the procedure of applying knowledge to problem-solving tasks can be elicited and represented in a concept map to support group discussion and task completion, should be provided to students. Further, different from jointly drawing a concept map on a piece of paper or in one computer by a group of learners with face-to-face discussion, web-based collaborative concept mapping may experience technical problems in editing a concept map remotely by members with limited instant communication. While collaborative learning has been increasingly expanded to online settings, more studies are needed to investigate how the use of web-based collaborative concept mapping can be guided and facilitated to foster effective learning and interaction.
