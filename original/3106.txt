There is a growing body of research exploring the potential benefits of implementing Facebook groups in the educational domain. The present study contributes to this literature by investigating the impact of having an official course Facebook group on several important outcomes. In a quasi-experiment, students in a second year university course either had access to an official course Facebook group or not, depending on the campus on which they were enrolled. Results indicated that students on the campus that implemented an official course Facebook group reported a greater sense of social connectedness, better relationships with faculty, and lower course-related stress, compared to students on the campus that did not have a Facebook group. Furthermore, having an official Facebook group indirectly enhanced course engagement and course satisfaction through social connectedness. These findings support the idea that Facebook groups can be a beneficial tool to foster positive outcomes for higher education students.

1. Introduction
Facebook has emerged as one of the most popular social networking platforms used by university students (Ellison, Steinfield, & Lampe, 2007). Although it is predominantly used by students to build and maintain social connections in their personal lives, researchers have identified potential benefits of utilizing Facebook and its features for educational purposes (Manca & Ranieri, 2016). For one, Facebook is a platform already ubiquitous in students' lives, and is thus familiar and convenient (Hew, 2011). Importantly, Facebook is equipped with a multitude of functions that lend themselves to teaching and learning. The present research focuses specifically on the capacity for Facebook to allow educators to create “Facebook groups” – online, accessible, and easily moderated communities that permit educators and students to continue their interaction outside of class (Ractham & Firpo, 2011).

1.1. Facebook groups as an educational tool
Research consistently demonstrates that Facebook groups are an effective tool to use to support learning (Manca and Ranieri, 2013, Manca and Ranieri, 2016), affording benefits not offered by traditional online learning management systems (LMS). Work directly comparing official course Facebook groups to LMS have shown that students are more likely to participate and interact in their Facebook groups than on LMS (for a review, see Manca and Ranieri, 2013, Manca and Ranieri, 2016). Proponents of the use of Facebook groups in education have suggested that Facebook groups have advantages over traditional LMS, in that they promote active learning and collaboration (Meishar-Tal, Kurtz, & Pieterse, 2012). Analyses of content posted by students in Facebook groups further demonstrate that Facebook groups are a platform through which students are more likely to affectively communicate encouragement and support to one another (English & Duncan-Howell, 2008; Whittaker, Howarth, & Lymn, 2014).

Despite the unique advantages offered by Facebook as a tool in the domain of education, there is evidence of resistance in a subset of students to its use as such (Manca and Ranieri, 2013, Manca and Ranieri, 2016). Students most reluctant to the educational use of Facebook groups have cited privacy concerns and the blurring of academic and social boundaries as primary reasons for their disinclination (Madge, Meek, Wellens, & Hooley, 2009; Manca and Ranieri, 2013, Manca and Ranieri, 2016; Selwyn, 2009). It is worth noting, however, that this resistance is typically expressed in the anticipatory reactions of students who have not yet had experience with the educational use of Facebook groups (Madge et al., 2009). Otherwise, it only arises in instances where Facebook groups are mandated in place of a traditional LMS (Baran, 2010; Manca and Ranieri, 2013, Manca and Ranieri, 2016; Meishar-Tal et al., 2012). In such cases, students have expressed that, although beneficial, Facebook groups should not be the sole learning and teaching platform for a course (Baran, 2010). It is possible, then, that these concerns would be alleviated where Facebook groups are offered as a non-mandatory resource to supplement an existing LMS, which is often the case (Manca and Ranieri, 2013, Manca and Ranieri, 2016).

In spite of the minor issues above, the evidence clearly suggests that most students respond favorably to the implementation of Facebook groups as an educational tool (Divall & Kirwin, 2012; Hurt et al., 2012). Students perceive Facebook groups as beneficial, in that they facilitate discussion, communication, and collaboration with staff and other students, as well as provide a platform for the sharing and distribution of educational resources (Hung & Yuen, 2010; Irwin, Ball, Desbrow, & Leveritt, 2012; McCarthy, 2010). With its capacity to connect educators and students, independent of space and time, researchers have suggested that Facebook groups allow for the development of a greater sense of social connectedness (Hurt et al., 2012). The evidence linking the use of Facebook use and social connectedness, however, has to date been predominantly qualitative or descriptive in nature (Barczyk & Duncan, 2013; Hung & Yuen, 2010; Ractham & Firpo, 2011).

1.2. Evidence for the impact of Facebook groups on social connectedness
Preliminary inferential evidence for the link between having a course Facebook group and greater social connectedness was demonstrated by Hurt et al. (2012), who randomly assigned university students to use a course Facebook group or the Blackboard LMS. The authors found that students assigned to the course Facebook group felt that they “got to know other students” to a greater extent than those assigned to use Blackboard. More recently, a broad-scale investigation by Sheeran and Cummings (2018) found that university students in courses with an official Facebook group attached reported a greater sense of belonging to their institution than those in courses that did not have a Facebook group. In addition, university students who had both courses with and courses without an official Facebook group reported better peer relationships in the courses with an official Facebook group.

Other than in the above studies, the link between course Facebook groups and greater social connectedness in students has not yet been corroborated with further rigorous, quantitative analysis. The present research aims to address this gap in the literature by investigating whether students in a course implementing an official Facebook group feel greater social connectedness compared to students enrolled in the same course, but do not have access to an official Facebook group. Guided by psychological theory, the present research also assesses the potential effects of having an official course Facebook group on other important outcomes that may arise as a function of heightened social connectedness, including more positive relationships with faculty, greater course engagement, lower course-related stress, and greater course satisfaction.

1.3. Facebook groups and other important outcomes
A positive relationship with faculty is pivotal to students' learning and engagement (Lundberg & Schreiner, 2004; Umbach & Wawrzynski, 2005), and is thus an important outcome to consider. Given that official course Facebook groups are often created and monitored by faculty (Ractham & Firpo, 2011) and provide greater opportunities for interaction with faculty (Divall & Kirwin, 2012), the implementation of an official course Facebook group should theoretically improve student relationships with faculty. Accordingly, Sheeran and Cummings (2018) found that relationships with faculty were better in courses with an official Facebook page than courses without. Furthermore, the social connectedness that results from being part of an official course Facebook group may potentially form with faculty as well as with other students. Thus, an official course Facebook group may also predict more positive relationships with faculty as a byproduct of facilitating greater social connectedness.

Past research has been mixed with regard to the effect of having an official course Facebook group on course engagement. For example, Dyson, Vickers, Turtle, Cowan, and Tassone (2015) found no significant effect of having access to a course Facebook group on participants' self-rated engagement. However, when students were split as a function of whether or not they actually accessed the Facebook group when it was available to them, students who did access the course Facebook group reported greater engagement compared to those who did not. Thus, the direct links between having an official course Facebook group and course engagement remains uncertain. The wider literature shows, however, that perceived social support, a fundamental aspect of social connectedness (Newcomb, 1990), is associated with higher academic motivation (Legault, Green-Demers, & Pelletier, 2006; Wentzel, 1998). As such, by enhancing social connectedness, an official course Facebook group may have an indirect effect on course engagement in students.

Previous work has not yet considered the effect of an official course Facebook group on course-related stress. Official course Facebook groups provide a mechanism through which students can easily liaise and debrief with peers and faculty, and have queries answered. Thus, it is logical that having access to an official course Facebook group may reduce course-related stress in students. Furthermore, broader research in psychology has consistently demonstrated the stress-alleviating benefits of social connectedness. Social connectedness has been linked to lower anxiety (Lee & Robbins, 1998), and lower perceived stress in college students (Lee, Keough, & Sexton, 2002). Perceived social support has also been linked to reduced overall stress (Cohen & Wills, 1985), and academic stress (Misra, Crist, & Burant, 2003; Rayle & Chung, 2007). Thus, to the extent that an official course Facebook group fosters social connectedness, it should also predict lower course-related stress.

Finally, although the extant literature has not investigated the impact of having an official course Facebook group on course satisfaction, research on cognate outcomes can again be extrapolated from to support this link. Psychological research has linked social connectedness to greater host-country satisfaction in international students (Hendrickson, Rosen, & Aune, 2011), as well as higher academic retention rates (Allen, Robbins, Casillas, & Oh, 2008). Academic retention, especially, is conceptually related to satisfaction. It should therefore follow that an official course Facebook group should predict greater course satisfaction, to the extent that it promotes social connectedness.

1.4. The present research
The primary aim of the present study was to assess the impact of attaching an official Facebook group to a university course on several key outcome variables, including social connectedness, relationships with faculty, course engagement, course-related stress, and course satisfaction. The study used a quasi-experimental design conducted within the context of a second year psychology course offered across two campuses of the same Australian university. Whereas one campus implemented an official course Facebook group, the other did not. Based on past preliminary evidence, we predicted that students who had access to an official course Facebook group would report a greater sense of social connectedness than those who did not. In line the broader literature, we also expected that a greater sense of social connectedness would be associated with better relationships with faculty, greater course engagement, lower course-related stress, and greater course satisfaction. Therefore, we also made the tentative prediction that having access to an official course Facebook page would also predict better relationships with faculty, greater course engagement, lower course-related stress, and greater course satisfaction, if not directly, then indirectly through social connectedness.

We also recognised the potential for students on the campus not implementing an official course Facebook group to create their own unofficial course Facebook groups (Aaen & Dalsgaard, 2016). Thus, a secondary goal of the present study was to explore, for students who did not have access to an official course Facebook group, whether being part of an unofficial course Facebook group would have the same effect on social connectedness, relationships with faculty, engagement, course-related stress, and course satisfaction, as described above. No specific hypotheses regarding the effect of having an unofficial course Facebook group were made, given this was an exploratory research question.

2. Methods
2.1. Participants
Participants were students enrolled in a second year psychology course across two campuses of a large Australian university. All students were recruited via email and were offered the chance to go into a draw to win one of ten $15 AUD gift vouchers as an incentive for participation. The final sample consisted of 67 students, including 50 females, 16 males, and 1 “other”. Ages ranged from 18 to 49 (M = 26.75, SD = 8.72). Of the sample, 81% identified as White/Caucasian, 9% identified as Asian/South Asian, 3% identified as Latino/Hispanic, 1% identified as Indigenous, and 6% did not specify their race.

2.2. Design and procedure
The second year psychology course from which students were recruited was offered across two campuses within the same state. The course ran during the same time of the year on both campuses. It was administered in a traditional format, with on-campus classes held over twelve weeks. Classes were held on Monday on one campus and Thursday on the other. Previous to the year in which the present study was conducted, both campuses had access to a Blackboard LMS, which was the primary modality through which the course instructors communicated and distributed course materials to students. Neither campus course offering, however, had an official Facebook group attached.

In the year the present study was conducted, instructors implemented an official Facebook group for the course on one campus (hereafter referred to as Campus A) but not the other (hereafter referred to as Campus B). Instructors, course content, and course assessment remained otherwise constant across campuses. Furthermore, both campuses retained access to the Blackboard LMS, which remained the primary modality through which instructors formally communicated with and distributed course materials to students on both campuses. The study was therefore a between-groups quasi-experimental design in which one offering of a course had an official course Facebook group attached and a second offering of the same course did not. This allowed us to test the unique effect of implementing an official course Facebook group on the dependent measures.

For the purposes of this study, the official course Facebook group acted as a supplementary, non-mandatory course resource for students, on which they could informally interact with one another and instructors more easily. This separates the present study from previous experiments that incorporated important course content and assessment into their official course Facebook groups (Dyson et al., 2015; Hurt et al., 2012). Specific student uses of the official course Facebook group in the present study included posting content-related questions and assessment-related questions (e.g., referencing, APA formatting), responding to others' questions (by referring them to relevant course materials, directly attaching relevant course materials, and/or providing additional explanations), sharing media relevant to the course content (e.g., Youtube videos, humorous internet memes), and sharing self-generated practice questions in preparation for exams. Instructors monitored this Facebook group to directly respond to student questions (that other students had not responded to after a period of time), and to confirm that students' responses to other students' questions were correct.

After the completion of classes, but before the release of grades, students were contacted via the course email system and asked to participate in a course survey for the chance to win one of ten $15 AUD gift vouchers. A weblink to the survey was included in the email. A total of three recruitment emails were sent. The survey was hosted on the online survey platform, Qualtrics. After providing informed consent, students filled out the survey. Upon completion of the survey, students were debriefed and directed to another webpage to submit their details for the prize draw.

2.3. Materials
2.3.1. Official Facebook group membership
Before completing the dependent measures, students were first asked to indicate whether they were enrolled on Campus A (the campus implementing the official Facebook group) or Campus B. Students indicating that they were enrolled on Campus A were then asked whether or not they were members of the official course Facebook group, given that this was the focus of the present study. Six students from Campus A indicated that they were not members of the official course Facebook group and were thus excluded from analyses (analyses retaining these students yielded the same results as those reported in this paper).

2.3.2. Unofficial Facebook group membership
Students were also asked whether or not they were members of any unofficial course Facebook group; that is, a course Facebook group that was not officially created and monitored by faculty.

2.3.3. Social connectedness
Fourteen items assessed the level of social connectedness that students felt within the course. Responses on these items were made on a 7-point Likert scale. Four of these items were adapted from Doosje, Ellemers, and Spears (1995) group identification measure (e.g., “I identified with the [COURSECODE] cohort”, “I felt strong ties with the [COURSECODE] cohort”; 1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). Ten items were adapted from Rovai's (2002) Classroom Community connectedness scale (e.g., “I felt that students in [COURSECODE] cared about each other”, “I did not feel a spirit of community in [COURSECODE]”{reverse-coded}; 1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). These two scales were conceptually similar and highly inter-correlated, so they were averaged into a single social connectedness composite, with higher scores reflecting perceived greater social connectedness (α = 0.92).

2.3.4. Relationship with faculty
Ten items adapted from Gunuc and Kuzu (2014) assessed students' relationship with the faculty. Responses on these items were made on a 7-point Likert scale (e.g., “I liked the teaching staff in [COURSECODE]”, “I think the teaching staff in [COURSECODE] were competent in their fields”; 1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). Responses were averaged such that higher scores reflected more positive relationships with the faculty (α = 0.94).

2.3.5. Engagement
Ten items adapted from Gunuc and Kuzu (2014), and Shelton and Smith (1998) assessed students' level of engagement with the course. Responses on these items were made on a 7-point Likert scale (e.g., “I felt engaged with [COURSECODE]?”, “I put effort into [COURSECODE]?”; 1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). Responses were averaged such that higher scores reflected greater course engagement (α = 0.89).

2.3.6. Stress
Five items were developed to assess the extent to which students experienced stress in the course. Responses on these items were made on a 7-point unipolar scale (e.g., “To what extent did you feel stressed in [COURSECODE]?”, “To what extent did you feel calm in [COURSECODE]?”{reverse-coded}; 1 = not at all, 7 = extremely). Responses were averaged such that higher scores reflected greater course-related stress (α = 0.91).

2.3.7. Course satisfaction
Two items assessed the extent to which students were satisfied with the course. Responses on these items were made on a 7-point unipolar scale (i.e., “Overall, how satisfied were you with [COURSECODE]?”, “Overall, how much did you enjoy [COURSECODE]?”; 1 = not at all, 7 = extremely). Responses were averaged such that higher scores reflected greater course satisfaction (r = 0.86, p < .001).

2.3.8. Demographic information
Students were also asked to record their gender, age, and race.

3. Results
In total, the sample comprised 34 students who had access to an official course Facebook group (enrolled on Campus A), and 33 students who did not have access to an official course Facebook group (enrolled on Campus B). Of the students enrolled on Campus B, 14 belonged to an unofficial course Facebook group, and 19 did not. There were also five students on Campus A who reported being a member of an unofficial course Facebook group. This lower frequency was expected, given that the students on Campus A had access to an official course Facebook group. Refer to Table 1 for the breakdown of students by membership in official and unofficial course Facebook groups.

3.1. The impact of an official course Facebook group
The main analyses compared students who did or did not have access to the official course Facebook group on the dependent variables. A series of between-groups t-tests were used to test whether social connectedness, relationship with faculty, course engagement, course-related stress, and course satisfaction differed as a function of having access to an official course Facebook group (see Table 2). Results indicated that students who had an official course Facebook group felt more socially connected with others in the course (p = .001), had more positive relationships with the faculty (p = .001), and experienced less stress during the course (p = .008), compared to those who did not have an official course Facebook group. Having an official course Facebook group, however, had no direct effect on course engagement (p = .355) or course satisfaction (p = .134).

An examination of the correlations between the dependent variables (see Table 3), indicated that, as expected, social connectedness was associated with better relationships with faculty (p < .001), greater engagement (p < .001), lower course-related stress (p = .004), and greater course satisfaction (p < .001). This indicated that social connectedness could be a potential mediator of the link between having an official course Facebook group and the other dependent variables.

Although not pertinent to the aims of the current investigation, correlations also emerged between the other dependent variables. Better relationships with faculty were associated with greater course engagement (p < .001), lower course-related stress (p = .004), and greater course satisfaction (p < .001). Greater course engagement was associated with lower course-related stress (p = .014), and greater course satisfaction (p < .001). Finally, greater course-related stress was associated with less course satisfaction (p = .005).

The indirect effect of having an official course Facebook group on the dependent variables via social connectedness was tested using bootstrapping procedures recommended by Preacher and Hayes (2004). Having an official course Facebook group predicted greater social connectedness (β = 0.40, p = .001), which then went on to predict better relationships with faculty (β = 0.42, p < .001), greater course engagement (β = 0.45, p = .001), lower course-related stress (β = −0.27, p = .038), and greater course satisfaction (β = 0.50, p < .001). Results based on 5000 bootstrapped samples revealed that having an official course Facebook group significantly, indirectly predicted better relationships with faculty (IE = 0.30, 95% CI [0.08, 0.70]), greater course engagement (IE = 0.31, 95% CI [0.09, 0.67]), lower course-related stress (IE = −0.25, 95% CI [−0.61, −0.03]), and greater course satisfaction (IE = 0.48, 95% CI [0.16, 0.98]), through social connectedness.

3.2. The impact of an unofficial course Facebook group
A secondary set of analyses was performed to test whether being part of an unofficial course Facebook group conferred the same benefits as being part of an official course Facebook group. Students from the campus that did not implement an official course Facebook group (i.e., Campus B) were split based on whether or not they reported being a member of an unofficial course Facebook group. A series of between-groups t-tests were used to test whether social connectedness, relationship with faculty, course engagement, course-related stress, and course satisfaction differed as a function of belonging to an unofficial course Facebook group (see Table 4). Results indicated that belonging to an unofficial course Facebook group had no effect on social connectedness (p = .837), relationships with faculty (p = .806), course engagement (p = .445), course-related stress (p = .671), or course satisfaction (p = .934).

4. Discussion
The purpose of the present research was to investigate the impact of attaching an official Facebook group to a university course on several key outcome variables, including social connectedness, relationships with faculty, course engagement, course-related stress, and course satisfaction. Most important was the prediction that an official course Facebook group would enhance students' sense of social connectedness. Supporting this, results showed that students who had access to an official course Facebook group reported greater social connectedness than those who did not. This finding corroborates previous studies which have found preliminary evidence for a link between the educational use of Facebook groups and social connectedness (Barczyk & Duncan, 2013; Hung & Yuen, 2010; Hurt et al., 2012; Ractham & Firpo, 2011; Sheeran & Cummings, 2018). It provides strong, quantitative support for the notion that official course Facebook groups can cultivate a learning community in which students feel connected to, and supported by, their peers and faculty.

Findings also showed, in line with predictions and previous research (Sheeran & Cummings, 2018), that students who had access to an official course Facebook group reported better relationships with faculty than those who did not. This makes sense, given that faculty are typically responsible for monitoring official course Facebook groups (Ractham & Firpo, 2011), and official course Facebook groups, in turn, give rise to more opportunities to interact and communicate with faculty (Divall and Kirwin, 2012). Further to this, results demonstrated that having an official course Facebook group also had an indirect effect on relationships with faculty via social connectedness. This suggests that one route through which an official course Facebook group can enhance relationships with faculty is via promoting a sense of social connectedness with the class as a whole.

There was no significant difference in engagement with the course between students who had access to an official course Facebook group and those who did not. This was somewhat in line with the past literature, which has to date been inconsistent in showing an effect of having an official course Facebook group on student engagement (Dyson et al., 2015). Findings demonstrated, however, that having an official course Facebook group had an indirect effect on course engagement through social connectedness. This pattern is in line with the broader psychological literature, which has linked social support to higher academic motivation (Legault et al., 2006; Wentzel, 1998). Thus, this study is the first to show that students feel more engaged with a course if they have a greater sense of social connectedness within that course, which can be brought about by implementing an official course Facebook group.

The findings also showed that students who had access to an official course Facebook group experience less stress in the course than those who did not, and that this difference could be explained by social connectedness. Thus, official course Facebook groups can help alleviate stress by cultivating a sense of social connectedness and support. This finding contributes to a line of work that has reliably provided strong evidence to show that social connectedness can reduce stress in a variety of contexts (Cohen & Wills, 1985; Lee et al., 2002; Lee & Robbins, 1998; Misra et al., 2003; Rayle & Chung, 2007). It is the first to extend this literature to the study of the benefits of using official course Facebook groups in the domain of education.

Finally, there was no significant difference in course satisfaction between students who had access to an official course Facebook group and those who did not. Again, however, findings demonstrated that having an official course Facebook group had an indirect effect on course satisfaction through social connectedness. This research was the first to demonstrate a link between social connectedness and course satisfaction, specifically, supplementing past work that has demonstrated a link between social connectedness and higher academic retention rates (Allen et al., 2008). It is also the first to show that students feel more satisfied with a course if they have a greater sense of social connectedness in that course, which can be brought about by implementing an official course Facebook group.

Whereas having access to an official course Facebook group was associated with the positive outcomes above, belonging to an unofficial course Facebook group was not. There could be many reasons for this. Unofficial course Facebook groups are not created, monitored, or sanctioned by faculty, and thus do not allow the student members to interact with faculty. They are also not officially tied to the course, and would not attract the numbers that an official Facebook group would. For these reasons, they may not promote positive outcomes like an increased sense of social connectedness, positive relationships with faculty, or alleviate course-related stress to the extent that official course Facebook groups do.

Despite not being relevant to the aims of the current study, relationships also emerged between relationships with faculty, course engagement, course-related stress, and course satisfaction. Further research should be conducted to further explore these relationships and the causal mechanisms underlying them.

4.1. Limitations & future directions
The present findings should be interpreted in light of limitations that were part of the design. One limitation was the quasi-experimental nature of the study. That is, rather than randomly assigning students to have access to an official course Facebook group or not, the campus on which students were enrolled in the course determined whether or not they had access to an official course Facebook group. Although unlikely, it is possible that factors other than the Facebook group that varied across campuses contributed to the differences seen in the present study. As specified, however, all other aspects of the course remained constant. To corroborate the current findings, future research could employ an experimental design in which students in a course are randomly allocated to be part of an official course Facebook group or not. Further support for the impact of an official course Facebook group on the outcome variables may also be achieved through implementing a pre-post design, where the outcome variables are measured at both the beginning and end of the course.

Another limitation was that this study was conducted using only students enrolled in a second year psychology course. Thus, it is possible that the findings in the present study may not generalize to courses in other disciplines. There is no theoretical reason to suspect, however, that the implementation of official course Facebook groups in courses of other disciplines would yield discrepant results. Nonetheless, further research should explore these effects in other educational contexts to determine if they replicate.

4.2. Conclusions
The present study builds upon the literature examining the impact of implementing Facebook groups in the educational domain by demonstrating that an official course Facebook group can directly foster a sense of social connectedness, enhance relationships with faculty, and alleviate stress in students. Furthermore, an official Facebook group can indirectly promote engagement and increase course satisfaction through social connectedness. These findings provide further evidence to suggest that instructor-facilitated Facebook groups can be a beneficial tool to foster positive outcomes for students in tertiary education. Future research would do well to corroborate these findings using an experimental or pre-post design, in a variety of courses.
