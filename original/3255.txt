1. Introduction
Nowadays, the interest in the Internet of Things (IoT) is rising considerably with the development of information communication which sanctions persistent, direct and automated Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interaction or Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) (Chowdhury and Raut, 2018; Tran-Dang and Kim, 2018). The IoT system endeavours to implement a logic which is based on computer programs to an ecosystem of things or devices, which then can be controlled or monitored by a centralized engine (typically based on cloud computing) (Fan et al., 2020). Entities or devices in IoT are provided with a digital description in the physical world. This digital ‘wrapper’ authorizes communication with Information and Communications Technology (ICT) entities which are present on a private, public, hybrid cloud, on a Local Area Network (LAN), or at the ends of Wide Area Network (WAN) (Brous et al., 2020).

IoT applications are categorized into two broad areas. The first class includes various types of sensing applications, such as traffic monitoring (Yamada et al., 2018), power administration (Radhakrishnan and Gopalakrishnan, 2020), Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) (Madaan et al., 2020), smart cities (Bhushan et al., 2020a), crowdsensing (Luo et al., 2019) and industrial automation (Hassan et al., 2020). Whereas, the second class deals with data analytics rather than the physical aspects and characteristics of the sensors themselves. These applications refer to the elementary renovation of business processes that are linked to marketable functions such as insurance, banking, organizational processes and healthcare provision enhancement (Makhdoom et al., 2019). Considering the broadening scope of IoT implementation, security and safety of the network becomes a critical aspect of the IoT system, especially under constrained resources in terms of power, storage and controlled nodes proficiency. Furthermore, limited capability of operating systems, vendor-specific application installations, deployment in uncontrolled open environment and limited computational capability of the end nodes are several other factors that contribute to this vulnerability of IoT systems (Arora et al., 2019; Goel et al., 2019).

Owing to these challenges, it is necessary to rethink and fundamentally restructure the IoT systems (Butun et al., 2020). Currently, “blockchain” has emerged as the most suitable candidate technology that promises to support a distributed and secure ecosystem for the IoT (Bhushan et al., 2020b). Blockchain technology was first described in 1991 as “a cryptographically secured chain of blocks” by Haber et al. (Haber and Stornetta, 1991). However, it received universal recognition after it was implemented as a public ledger by S. Nakamoto in a cryptocurrency named Bitcoin (2018). Since then, it has received enormous attention from various industries including finance, agriculture, logistics and insurance. Owing to its ability to digitise transactions efficiently, it contributes towards making several processes faster, leaner and more transparent. Blockchain can be described as a chain of cryptographically linked timestamped blocks that operates as a distributed ledger whose data is shared among its peers. Therefore, blockchain is capable of solving the security issues associated with the traditional IoT systems by leveraging a distributed and secure environment (Biswal and Bhushan, 2019; Ali et al., 2019a). Due to its decentralized, immutable, auditable and fault tolerant features, several researchers are making efforts to eliminate the need for a central trusted authority and leverage blockchain to support decentralized IoT communications. The advantages associated with a blockchain based IoT systems are manifolds. Firstly, it mitigates single point of failure, promotes fault tolerance capabilities and enables end-to-end communications without involvement of a centralized server. Secondly, participants in a blockchain network can verify data integrity as well as the sender's identity. Thirdly, the tamper proof data storage capability of blockchain enables to leverage secure software updates to IoT devices. Further, blockchain stores the data and event logs in an immutable manner thereby guaranteeing traceability and accountability (Bhushan et al., 2020c; Wu et al., 2019a).

In recent research, numerous researchers have tried to exploit the benefits of integrating blockchain with the IoT in varied application scenarios. Several survey articles focussed on reviewing these solutions in varied degree of dept and scope. Huckle et al. (2016) highlighted the benefits of integrating blockchain technology and IoT for shared economy applications. Similarly, Christidis et al. (Christidis and Devetsikiotis, 2016) highlighted the role of smart contracts and blockchain for IoT systems. However, these works did not provide a detailed description of the security improvements in IoT using blockchain technology and the challenges associated with this integration. In another work, Zheng et al. (2018) comprehensively surveyed blockchain technology in various application and technological perspectives. The work highlighted the architecture, consensus schemes, applications and challenges related to blockchain. Similarly, Lu et al. (Lu, 2018) presented an extensive survey on the principles of blockchain and its practical applications in diversified sectors. However, these works failed to explore the blockchain transaction process and highlight the security improvements in IoT using blockchain technology. In another work, Dai et al. (2019) presented a detailed overview of blockchain technology and investigated its convergence with IoT. Similarly, Alladi et al. (2019) attempted to review existing blockchain applications in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) settings and highlighted the associated industry specific challenges. However, the work failed to highlight the approaches, security benefits and challenges associated with the integration of blockchain and IoT. In another work, Feng et al. (2019) discussed blockchain in detail and highlighted the related privacy issues but did not consider the applicability of blockchain in the realm of IoT. Similarly, Alotaibi et al. (Alotaibi, 2019) attempts to survey the recent blockchain-based advances to overcome the cyber security challenges in IoT but does not throw enough light on background, transaction process, consensus algorithms and the application areas of blockchain technology. In another work, Li et al. (2020a) investigated various types of security threats and attacks related to blockchain systems. Similarly, Mohanta et al. (2020) highlighted the IoT architecture along with its enabling technology and presented an in-depth description of various security issues within the IoT system. However, these works did not highlight the security benefits associated with the integration of IoT and blockchain technology. In another work, Wang et al. (Sengupta et al., 2020) highlighted the role of blockchain in Industry 4.0 and IoT. Similarly, Sengupta et al. (Wang et al., 2020a) presented a detailed description of security attacks in IIoT along with the proposed countermeasures and highlighted the importance of blockchain technology towards addressing the related issues. However, the work fails to explore various aspects of blockchain technology including the transaction process, consensus mechanisms and challenges associated with integrating blockchain technology and IoT.

2. IoT background
IoT finds huge range of applications in our day-to-day life and the internal composition of these applications includes the interaction of end-devices and networking technologies. Heterogeneity and decentralization are two key features of IoT (Ren et al., 2020). Given its large structure and extensively large piles of data to be analysed, decentralization property is crucial. Data is gathered, analysed and recorded in a decentralized approach by the IoT devices. The algorithms implemented in the IoT system, such as, decentralized computation algorithms and clustering algorithms in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), which are decentralized in nature can significantly improve the scalability and capacity of the IoT network (Bhushan and Sahoo, 2020; Varshney et al., 2019). The number of devices in the IoT network will continue to increase with a massive rate. By 2020, this number is expected to increase up to 50 billion (Georgakopoulos, 2019). Because of this expansion, the IoT framework faces growing demand for volume.

2.1. Benefits and risks of IoT adoption [BOLD characteristics]
The impact of IoT technology can be understood by looking into the expected benefits and risks associated with it. Studying benefits will provide the reasons to adopt IoT whereas studying risks involved will provide with an understanding of the impact of IoT adoption on different industries. The impact on the organizations refers to the impact of data produced by the IoT network. There are three major characteristics of IoT namely “Big”, “Open” and “LinkeD” (denoted as BOLD) (Dwivedi et al., 2016). In comparison to the traditional schemes, IoT generates high-quality data in substantially large volumes with enhanced accuracy, diversity and timeliness. This data is also referred to as Big Data. The Open characteristic of IoT data refers to the fact that the data manufactured for a particular purpose can be utilized for multiple operations aiming to achieve different goals. Linked characteristic of IoT allows the combination of data from multiple sources or the combination of data from “things” (or devices) with that from traditional sources. The expected benefits of IoT adoption along with the risks involved are discussed in the subsections below.

2.1.1. Big
Considering the diversity of IoT technology, various kinds of sensors can be installed for ensuring compliance to regulations and public safety. IoT applications can offer more efficient and secure data collection process. Therefore, big data analytics can prove to be an important factor in providing smart governance and aiding teamwork among collaborating agencies (Hashem et al., 2016). Furthermore, the better timeliness and large volumes of data generated by IoT can improve operational planning and reaction to previously unforeseen events enhancing the performance of industries. Moreover, IoT is progressing in asset management domain where it is being used to monitor the quality and health of industrial assets (Kwon et al., 2016).

On the other hand, data leaks can majorly impact the privacy of individuals by revealing critical information such as personal financial status, health conditions, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to allow selected authorized access to manufacture or utilize data and prevent the misuse of resources by unauthorized access. Although the previously unforeseen sights may be uncovered using big data, the duality of IoT can be sighted in changes to industries that are important for the conversion of big data into practical information while securing individual rights. The quality of data is not clear and there exists no universally accepted standard data storage architecture. High cost and risks induced due to reduced return on investment is another important risk in adoption of IoT (Wahyudi et al., 2018).

2.1.2. Openness
The big data feature provided by IoT can enable the data to be made available for general open use. Organisational transparency, waste reduction and improvement of business processes can be done by making information open to the public (Brous et al., 2019). Businesses and citizens can be empowered by enabling consumer self-service through improved information access. IoT provides industries to examine the real-world situations and thereby provides better decision-making ability, increased service efficiency and flexibility in deriving business values.

IoT relies on allowing other devices to utilize the publicly published data on the IoT network. However, this requires a mature set of protocols capable of publishing and sharing information while guaranteeing data accessibility. Furthermore, the challenges like scalability, real-time processing and search locality proves to be strong barriers in IoT adoption as the existing search mechanisms relies on remote information sharing and fails to efficiently provide local entity search. Several regulatory and technical barriers related to data sharing, security and ownership also needs to be addressed.

2.1.3. Linked
The Linked feature of IoT can help in empowering the community by providing consumer self-service and reduced labour costs. Fraud detection and developing consumer trust can also be provided by linking data from numerous sources. Besides, organizations can communicate effectively with their clients, additional service revenues can be supported and new opportunities for interaction can be provided by the insights gained from linking data from different sources. The insights collected from the processed big data can be used to improve effectiveness, compliance and efficiency (Amanullah et al., 2020).

IoT applications can be highly diverse in terms of potentials and protocols etc. Since the data is gathered from different sources, the users of this data are also different and the applications involving linked data employs various techniques to process this data. This complicates the design of an IoT architecture. Even though linking of data can ensure benefits, inappropriate implementation of guidelines and lack of policies can prove to be a challenge in the adoption of IoT. Since skilled staff and new organisational processes are needed, a shortage of skilled personnel, limited educational and training institutes can add to this difficulty (Brous et al., 2017).

The major benefits and risks associated with the aforementioned characteristics of IoT are summarized in Table 2.

2.2. Security requirements in IoT
Before estimating the potential security threats in the IoT system, firstly, the associating security pre-requisites must be resolved. Researchers have studied and determined the security prerequisites for IoT (Meneghello et al., 2019; Sinha et al., 2019). Some of the major security requirements in IoT is listed below.

•
Confidentiality: It is intended to hide information from unauthorized malicious users and can be described using two concepts. Firstly, it indicates that unauthorized users must not access confidential data. Secondly, it guarantees the protection of proprietary data and confidentiality. Cryptographic asymmetric and symmetric encryption schemes can contribute towards ensuring data confidentiality (Leithardt et al., 2020).

•
Integrity: It refers to the concept that data within IoT nodes cannot be tampered, consumed or altered by unapproved users or entities. Man-in-the-middle attack (Bhushan et al., 2017) is the most commonly launched attack that compromise data integrity by intercepting data in its way before it is passed on to the intended receiver.

•
Authenticity: It addresses the concerns related to origin of the information and guarantees that the data and transactions are authentic. Particularly, this principle must authenticate that the individuals or groups participating in the operation must be the ones they claim to be. Cryptographic digital signatures had contributed towards preserving the data authenticity (Gope and Sikdar, 2019).

•
Non-repudiation: This guarantees the ability to prove that an event or task has occurred, with the goal that it is not denied later. In general terms, it refers to data ownership where the receiver and sender cannot deny after having received or sent the data.

•
Authorization: It refers to the provision of granting permissions to any user to have or perform some operation.

•
Availability: It guarantees to provision data and other network services to authorized users at all times. This implies that the data and computational power must be available when required by a service. This ensures that the computation systems required to analyse data, the IoT nodes responsible for data capture as well as the communication links, all of the components should function appropriately (Xiong et al., 2019; Amini and Baidas, 2020).

2.3. Security challenges in IoT
Security in IoT domain is considered as a high priority research direction where interactions in the virtual world and the physical world may be encountered. Therefore, apart from addressing the traditional networking attacks, provisions for secure communications (for both machine-to-machine and human-to-human interactions) must be simultaneously provided by the deployed IoT protocols (Gazis, 2017; Sinche et al., 2020). The most prominent security challenges in IoT systems are listed as below.

•
Data volume: Numerous IoT applications such as smart cities and smart grids create huge piles of critical and confidential data, which is a probable target for the rising security risks.

•
Privacy protection: IoT nodes comprise of sensitive data which must not be identifiable, linkable and traceable and must be protected. Privacy protection is the major concern in today's interconnected world as the data is steadily being processed, conveyed, collected and leveraged by huge enterprises using an array of IoT devices (Granjal et al., 2015).

•
Resource limitations: Owing to its constrained computation power and memory, these devices do not even readily support operations of regular security protocols such as asymmetric key encryption or other advanced privacy preserving schemes (Benkhelifa et al., 2018).

•
Scalability: Generally, the IoT system involves a large number of entities. Thus, confidentiality and security protection procedures must efficiently scale throughout the network.

•
Heterogeneity: IoT connects numerous identities having varied complexity and capability. Further, these devices also differ in their release versions, technical interfaces they use and the function they need to perform. Therefore, the IoT protocols must support different devices under various situations and provide connection between heterogeneous network and things (Ngu et al., 2016).

•
Interoperability: The development and utilization of security procedures in IoT systems should not completely restrict the operational capabilities of IoT nodes. the lack of interoperability might lead to major technological issues such as impossibility to develop cross domain IoT applications, impossibility to employ non-interoperable devices within heterogeneous systems and user dissatisfaction (Aloi et al., 2017).

•
Autonomous control: The conventional data systems require configuration from users. However, the settings must be autonomously established in the end-devices of the IoT networks.

•
Attack resistant: Generally, the end-devices in IoT system are small with very little or no physical armour. For example, fixed devices could be destroyed by natural disasters or small sensor devices or mobile phones could be stolen (Hamad et al., 2020).

2.4. Security attacks in IoT
Owing to the huge number of devices connected in IoT systems, there is a subsequent increase in the vulnerabilities leading to various security attacks in IoT. Furthermore, the lack of network access control and data encryption measures enable the adversaries to launch attacks such as traffic analysis and eavesdropping (Kouicem et al., 2018; Bhushan and Sahoo, 2017). The most prevalent security attacks in IoT are listed as below.

•
End Device Attacks: Adversaries seize the devices and control them physically, resulting in perceptibility to the confidential data such as certificates and keys. Furthermore, several malicious users may pretend to be authentic nodes by utilizing the seized information and orchestrate other attacks (Xu et al., 2017a).

•
Communication Channel Attacks: sometimes, adversaries might attempt to intercept the communication channels and obtain access to the confidential data if the channel is not encrypted (Yin et al., 2018). The wireless channels can also be interfered or even jammed by these adversaries by transmitting corrupt or noisy signals.

•
Network Protocol Attacks: The adversaries may exploit the network protocol vulnerabilities to launch huge range of attacks such as sybil attack, blackhole attacks, wormhole attacks, reply attacks and Denial of Service (DoS) attack. These attacks would degrade the efficiency and precision of protocols and the associated voting mechanisms (Khan and Salah, 2018).

•
Sensory Data Attacks: Communication in the IoT system is carried out through ad hoc protocols, that is, the messages are communicated hop-by-hop until they reach their destination thus providing attackers with the opportunities to modify data or infuse corrupt data. Data tampering or modification is the process in which adversaries modify the data and broadcast it to other nodes (Zha et al., 2016). Corrupt data infusion means that the adversaries transmit data across the network with authentic identities (Xu et al., 2017b).

•
DoS Attack: A DoS attack leads to bottleneck condition and depletes resources of IoT systems so that the service is not available when required (Sicari et al., 2018). IoT devices have restrictions on communication and network resources thus proving DoS attacks to be disastrous. These attacks completely consume the small energy reserves of sensory nodes, degrade network interfaces, mitigate network lifespan and paralyze the complete framework (Huang et al., 2020a).

•
Software Attacks: A group of attacks which utilize loopholes of the software to mutate and control the entire system are referred to as software attacks. Generally, these attacks comprise of malicious scripts/virus/worms. Traditional internet security protocols, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are used to overcome the software attacks (Restuccia et al., 2018).

3. Overview of blockchain technology
In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto presented a revolutionary concept named “Bitcoin” for solving the trust issues encountered within information systems (Bitcoin, 2018). Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that nurtures its value without any support from a financial entity or a centralized authority. It is held by a decentralized Peer to Peer (P2P) network of participants making it verifiable and auditable. Blockchain is the underlying technology behind Bitcoin which gained even more popularity. The Blockchain is a constantly increasing ledger of information records, called blocks, which are connected to each other and are secured using cryptographic algorithms (Dinh et al., 2018). Consensus algorithm in blockchain ensures an unambiguous block ordering, consistency and integrity among the nodes of the chain (Wang et al., 2019a). A general block is comprised of information related to version, parent block hash, timestamp, nonce (which starts from 0 and increases every time after a hash calculation), transaction count and the combined hash of all transactions (Merkle root). With the generation of a new block, every node in the network will engage in block authentication process (Salman et al., 2019). When validated and approved, the block will be appended automatically with a reference that points to its previous or parent block. This results in easy detection of unidentified or unauthorized transactions since the hash value of the mutated or falsified block will be very much different from that of an unchanged block (Belotti et al., 2019). The basic blockchain structure is depicted in Fig. 1.

3.1. Characteristics of blockchain
The blockchain technology promises the highest degree of accountability and varied sectors are testing this innovation so that they can utilize it for data transmission, record keeping and other backend processes. As an un-alterable record, it progressively empowers them to follow documentation and confirm ownership of assets digitally. The key characteristics that make blockchain a revolution for the technical world are listed as below.

•
Transparency: Generally, for public blockchain systems, such as, Ethereum and Bitcoin, users can approach and communicate with blockchain network with equal rights. Furthermore, each transaction is authenticated and recorded in the distributed ledger, simultaneously being available for all the users. Thus, data on the blockchain is transparent to each node so as to validate the committed transaction in the blockchain (Al-Jaroodi and Mohamed, 2019a).

•
Decentralization: A central agency conducts transaction validation in traditional transaction management frameworks such as a bank thus resulting in a performance bottleneck, costly architecture and a single point of failure. On the other hand, blockchain provides validation of transactions taking place between two nodes without any intervention, jurisdiction or central entity jurisdiction. Therefore, reduces the overall service cost, performance bottleneck and the risk of single-point failure (Aderibole et al., 2020).

•
Immutability: As blockchain structure relies on consecutively linked blocks where each link is a hash of previous block's header, any sort of data tampering invalidates every consequently created block. Any mutation is easily identified as even slight modification on any transaction results in creation of a new Merkle tree data structure.

•
Pseudonymity: Irrespective of the transparency within blockchain transactions, the system can maintain a certain level of confidentiality by creating anonymous addresses for the users. However, blockchain systems can only maintain the confidentiality up to a particular level as these addresses can be traced. Thus, blockchain can only maintain the pseudonymity but not full confidentiality.

•
Non-Repudiation: In the blockchain transaction mechanism, each node is provided with a private key. This can later be accessed and validated by other nodes through the corresponding public key of that node. Thus, the transactions that are signed digitally using cryptography cannot be denied by the source node of the transaction.

•
Traceability: Every transaction recorded in the distributed ledger is also attached with a timestamp which is recorded at the time of transaction. Thus, the origin of transactions as well as the modifications can be easily verified and traced by the users after the analysis of data of blockchain with associated timestamps (Venkatesh et al., 2020).

3.2. Types of blockchains
Participants can interact with blockchain either as writers or as readers. A reader has a passive participation in the transaction process and concentrates on analysing record contents or validating the blockchain. On the other hand, writers participate actively in the transaction process and have the facility to extend the chain by using consensus protocols (Dasgupta et al., 2019; Soni and Bhushan, 2019). Blockchains are classified into three categories on the basis of permissions given to the users for interaction with the ledger. These categories are discussed in the subsections below.

3.2.1. Public blockchains
Public blockchains are also known as permission less blockchains. These facilitate participation in the consensus protocols and allows unrestricted usage of the main chain to any entity as reader or writer. Mining is mostly based on incentives so as to encourage miners to mine blocks. Hence the transaction cost in public ledgers is more as compared to private ledgers. The time taken by the transaction to complete is more in public blockchain as compared to private because of less connectivity in the nodes (Pilkington, 2016). Bitcoin (Bitcoin GitHub implementa, 2020), Ethereum (Wood and Ethereum, 2014) and Zerocash (Sasson et al., 2014) are some of the examples of public blockchains.

3.2.2. Private blockchains
Private blockchains are also known as permissioned blockchains. In this category, the number of the miner nodes are limited and their identities are known. Therefore, the participation in the transaction is only available to a selected number of miner nodes. Furthermore, a user may only have permission to access the data linked to the user himself. The confidentiality of user information is more in private blockchains as compared to public blockchains. Since, the number of nodes committing transactions is less, the transaction speed is more thus resulting in greater transaction throughput (Andreev et al., 2018). Quorum (JPMorgan, 2020) and Multichain (2020) are some examples of private blockchains.

3.2.3. Consortium blockchains
Consortium blockchains are also known as hybrid blockchains. They are called so as they reside between their public and private counterparts, but closer to the private form of blockchain (She et al., 2019a). The main aim of a consortium blockchain is to handle the difficulties faced by a particular industry by scaling the effect of cooperation. Therefore, an advantageous framework is created which includes allies along with business competitors. This blockchain is semi-decentralized implying that it is under the supervision of specific group members (Zhang and Chen, 2019). A multi-party consensus is there in which all of the operations are authenticated by unique predetermined nodes, not by everyone. The blockchain is completely managed by a particular group but is conserved from monopoly. As soon as each node agrees, this control allows to establish their own instructions, modify or delete erroneous transactions, modify account balances, etc. On the other hand, the centralized structure of consortium blockchain renders it powerless against malicious entities. Some of the specific industries where consortium blockchain fits in place are finance, banking, healthcare, insurance and logistics. Hyperledger Fabric (Hyperledger GitHub implem, 2020) and Ethermint (Ethereum GitHub implement, 2020) are some examples of consortium blockchains.

3.3. Architecture of smart contract
On the basis of the operational mechanism of smart contracts, its entire lifecycle can be represented using 5 stages namely negotiation, development, deployment, maintenance and learning (Wang et al., 2019b). According to this life cycle, a structure for exploration of smart contracts comprises of a 6-layered architecture that includes infrastructure layer, contract layer, operation layer, intelligence layer, manifestation layer and application layer. These layers are depicted in Fig. 2 and explored in the subsections below.

Fig. 2. Architecture of smart contracts.

3.3.1. Infrastructure layer
Infrastructure layer envelops the infrastructure that supports the smart contracts. It comprises of the Trusted Development Environments (TDE) which possess the development tools required for smart contract development such as programming languages, clients, wallets, development frameworks and a trusted execution environment. Blockchain provides a provision for the execution of smart contracts where the ultimate execution result is stored in the distributed ledger and trusted data feeds. Smart contracts are executed generally in secure execution environments in order to assure the safety of the framework. Hence, trusted data feeds are required to import real-world data in the form of transactions. The choice of these infrastructure components will impact the smart contract's overall attributes and design pattern.

3.3.2. Contracts layer
This layer comprises of situation-response rules, communication criteria and contract terms. This layer captures the stationary data and therefore can also be considered as a static database that include rules about contract communication, invocation and implementation. At the design stage, first, all responsible parties negotiate and establish the terms which may include intention agreements, business logics and legal provisions. Then, software engineers use technologies, such as design pattern and algorithm design to express the contract terms into the code of a program. Furthermore, the interaction standards (e.g., communication mode, access authority, etc.) should also be presented in this layer for communication between contracts and contracts or contracts and users (Karamitsos et al., 2018).

3.3.3. Operations layer
This layer summarizes all the dynamic processes in the smart contracts, including security analysis, mechanical design, updates, formal verification, and self-destruction. This layer contributes towards safe, efficient and precise working of smart contracts as vulnerable contracts can cause massive economic damage to the community. In the perspective of smart contract's life cycle, starting from negotiation to self-destruction, the design procedures make use of incentive and information theory that assist contracts to accomplish their functions effectively (Luu et al., 2016). Security analysis and formal verification mechanisms are used to validate the security. Updates can be technically implemented after the deployment of contracts on the blockchain. Self-destruction is directed to ensure network stability and high-risk susceptibility (Huang et al., 2019).

3.3.4. Intelligence layer
This layer provides intellect to the smart contracts by using various intelligence algorithms related to reasoning, perception, learning, socializing and decision-making. However, the newly developed smart contracts will not only be relying on “if-then” declarations but will also have “what-if” type calculation, deduction and decision-making in unidentified situations. The advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology resulted in the smart contracts to have some enhanced level of intellect (Modha et al., 2011; Gupta et al., 2020a). Therefore, these contracts are not only independent as they have abilities of task prioritization, selection and goal-oriented behaviours but also have civility through cooperation, interaction and negotiation. The optimization of contract design and operation can be achieved by providing the learning results as a feedback to the contracts layer.

3.3.5. Manifestation layer
This layer encapsulates various manifestations of smart contracts for possible applications consisting of Decentralized Applications (DApps), Decentralized Autonomous Corporations (DACs), Decentralized Autonomous Societies (DASs) and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) (What is aO? Available:, 2020). Smart Contracts that comprise of the critical activities of network nodes are comparable to the application interfaces of the blockchain which allows blockchain to be deployed in numerous application scenarios. For example, a variety of DApps can be created by writing business logics, legal provisions and intention agreements into the smart contracts. Moreover, the system built on the fourth layer will progressively transform into diverse DAOs, DASs and DACs. The traditional businesses are expected to improve with the help of these high-level manifestations laying the foundation for the emerging programmable society.

3.3.6. Applications layer
The Application layer comprises of all the applications that are built up to the manifestation layer. For instance, Plantoid is a DAO based application which is developed on Ethereum to accomplish a fully aesthetic society that connects designers, artists, audiences and networks into an interdependent relationship, thereby liberating art from hierarchically organized capitalist markets (Lotti, 2016).

3.4. Blockchain transaction process
Transactions are small tasks stored in public records (known as blocks) that are stored, implemented and executed for validation by all participants (Tschorsch and Scheuermann, 2016). In this, it is possible to review any previously committed transactions but their modification of any kind is not possible (Zheng et al., 2017). Blockchain transforms Bitcoin into a censorship-resistant, borderless digital currency as it facilitates decentralized execution of transactions within a peer-to-peer global network. The major concern for traditional centralized systems such as banks is “trust”. Blockchain serves to fill this requirement quite efficiently as it is a trustless system and provides trust via functions propagating various activities within the network (Glaser, 2017). The mining and consensus mechanism of blockchain relies heavily on cryptographic hash functions thereby enhancing its capability to address the security issues (Odwyer and Malone, 2014; Manimuthu et al., 2019). The hash output always remains the same for a given input and even a small change in input results in a significant amount of change in the output hash. It is a one-way function as calculating the input value from the known output value is not feasible thereby making this secure. Blockchain uses Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) which helps to ensure that only the true possessors can spend funds (Yuan and Wang, 2018). An attempt to make a fraudulent transaction is infeasible as the signature of every transaction is of 256 bits therefore the adversary needs to guess 2256 cases thereby leading to their resource exhaustion. Apart from the sender identity verification, the transaction validity (whether the sender has enough funds to transfer) also needs to be checked. This can be well achieved by analysing the ledger holding information about the past committed transactions.

3.4.1. Bitcoin transaction
The main purpose of Bitcoin cryptocurrency was to enable decentralized electronic cash payment system and eliminate central intermediaries between different parties. A bitcoin transaction deals with the transferring of ownership and it is initiated from the client's bitcoin wallet and later broadcasted throughout the network. Only if the transaction is valid, other network nodes associate it with the block they are mining and rebroadcast the transaction. The time consumed in including a transaction along with all other transactions is 10 min approximately (Valdivia et al., 2019; Decker and Wattenhofer, 2013). Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) is the capability of the user to spend the received the output amount of a transaction therefore it forms the major element of the bitcoin structure (Delgado-Segura et al., 2019). The received amount stays put as a separate entity in a bitcoin wallet and there is no chance of mixing of coins or cash as evident in a physical wallet. This can be better explained using an example. Consider a scenario in which bob receives two distinct amounts of $4 and $3 successively. If this is stored in any online or physical wallet, the result returns the sum of the two amounts that is $7. But, in a bitcoin wallet, it is stored as individual entities and the result shows the exact amounts of $4 and $3.

The overall bitcoin transaction process is depicted in Fig. 3. Successful miners are provided with incentives (transaction fees and block creation rewards) for validating transactions, managing transactions and creating new blocks to be added to the existing chain (Schrijvers et al., 2017). Users assign a transaction fee for the successful miners while sending a transaction. Even though there is no header information with respect to the transaction fee, it is achieved by sending a slightly lower value than the total UTXO to the recipients. Therefore, the transaction fee is represented by this unassigned transaction amount as depicted in equation (1).(1)

Fig. 3. Bitcoin transaction process.

Apart from the transaction data being verified and validated, miners also include a unique type of bitcoin transaction named “coinbase transaction” which can only be created by the miner and is created with every newly mined block on the network. The miners are also required to send the transaction fees collected by them in this transaction. Now, it is the responsibility of other network peers to verify whether the transaction is levelled out. The sum of transaction fees and the block reward is sent to the miners who need to assign its reward while block creation. Every other network node validates whether the block adheres to the requirements depicted in equation (2).(2)

3.4.2. Ethereum transaction
Similar to bitcoin that define its state in terms of UTXO, Ethereum brings forth the concept of account. The transactions in Ethereum are capable of updating the account balance directly without any need to maintain the states as in case of bitcoin UTXO thereby allowing easy exchange of data, messages and values between the account resulting state transactions. Ethereum basically works with two types of accounts: Contract Account (CA) and Externally Owned Account (EOA). CA represents a Smart Contract (SC), is controlled by code and owned by private keys. Whereas, EOA interacts with the blockchain via transactions and is essentially required for participation in the Ethereum network (Alharby and Moorsel, 2017; Hartel et al., 2019). “Ether” is the transferable amount in Ethereum and its denominator is known as “Wei” (Atzei et al., 2017). Ethereum and bitcoin use several common attributes such as transaction details, nonce and block hash. Apart from these, Ethereum additionally uses several fields such as smart contract's state, fees limit and so on.

Furthermore, there is a requirement of gas or crypto-fuel for any kind of action as an incentive-based model is employed by Ethereum for block creation. In order to reduce the complexity and computation overhead, gas is used instead of “ether” as the gas cryptocurrency is independent of valuation for the computation as well as the transaction fees. The major difference between ether and gas cryptocurrency is that the gas points remains static with market swings. It is the responsibility of the mining process to compute the gas points required to execute a transaction and the transaction gets rejected if the specified fee (in gas points) is not sufficient. If the gas points required for the execution is available in the account balance, the transaction is executed successfully and the remaining amount after executing is returned to the originating account. Miners compete for block creation and the one solving the puzzle first is labelled as “winner” and added to the main channel. Those solving them afterwards are labelled as “ommers” and appended as side blocks of the main channel (Ritz and Zugenmaier, 2018). The overall Ethereum transaction process is depicted in Fig. 4.

3.5. Consensus techniques
A major benefit of the blockchain system is the technology to validate the reliability and trustfulness of the block without the need of a trusted central authority. The consensus algorithms are applied in order to achieve a reliable and trustful consensus in the decentralized distributed framework. The consensus mechanisms which are typically implemented can be categorized into two: Probabilistic and Deterministic (Dai et al., 2019). The objective of probabilistic consensus mechanism is to save the authenticated block and then seek the consensus. On the other hand, the deterministic consensus mechanisms first reach the consensus and then save the authenticated block. Moreover, the former solves the discrepancy of multiple chain bifurcations by considering the longest chain whereas the later solves this challenge by performing numerous communication rounds in the network overlay. Numerous consensus techniques have been proposed on the basis of utilization of resources, attack tolerance capability, scalability and performance (Wang et al., 2019c; Bamakan et al., 2020; Gramoli, 2020). These mechanisms are generalized into two main categories: voting-based and proof-based. In voting-based consensus techniques, voting is done among participants for the validation of each block and a minimum number of votes are required for the block authentication based on the employed consensus mechanism. Whereas, in proof-based consensus techniques, few manager (called miners) are chosen who validate and append the freshly generated blocks to the main chain. These techniques mainly differ on how the miners are selected. The most popular consensus schemes are explored in the subsections below.

3.5.1. Proof of work (PoW)
PoW employs rigorous computation tasks (or consensus puzzle) that the miners need to solve for the generation of a new block. The miners who solve the puzzle receives the incentive for that block. Once the PoW is completed, the freshly generated block is appended to the chain after verification from the rest of the network. This verification is not a rigorous task and requires less effort as compared to solving the computational puzzle. Sometimes the blockchain may fork into different branches due to concurrent generation of blocks which is solved by contemplating that the longest chain of blocks will be the one which is valid. This provides a trust less distributed-consensus technique. It is extremely costly for the adversary to add a corrupt block or modify the blockchain since the remaining miners would outpace such adversaries in the process of block creation, thereby invalidating the maliciously created block. Technically, in order to add a manipulated block to the chain, it is mandatory to solve the puzzle before other miner nodes. But this is too exorbitant as it requires the adversary to possess 51% of the total resources, which is practically impossible (Kiayias and Zindros, 2020).

3.5.2. Proof of stake (PoS)
PoS was proposed to overcome the issues of high resource wastage in PoW. In PoS implemented systems, the blocks are said to be ‘forged’ not mined. The blockchain systems or the cryptocurrencies which are using the PoS technique often starts by launching with PoW and later switches to PoS. The “forger” is selected on the basis of its stake value in each block generation process. The more the wealth, the more will be the chance to win. In order to prevent the favouring of the wealthiest, several unique methods have been proposed such as Coin Age Selection (CAS) and Randomized Block Selection (RBS). The participants in CAS are selected on the basis of duration for which their coins have been stacked. The number of coins is multiplied with the number of days the coins were stacked for to calculate Coin Age. Incentives are provided by proposing an acceptable block after validation by other participants. On the other hand, RBS methods choose forgers on the basis of combination of the highest stake and the lowest hash value. Although PoS reduces resource wastage, there is a possibility that rich goes on to get richer. This conflicts with the main idea of a decentralized network (Deirmentzoglou et al., 2019; Saleh, 2018).

3.5.3. Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
DPoS is more democratic and efficient variant of PoS in which only a restricted number of participants (also called “witnesses”) participate in the block generation process (“Delegated Proof of Stake, 2020). Any participant who owns cryptocurrency is a stakeholder. These stakeholders select the witnesses by voting and these witnesses are responsible for obtaining consensus in the block generation and validation process. The voting power for the stakeholders depend on the amount of stake of each stakeholder. Generally, each witness presents an individual proposal when asking for votes. Also, the incentives collected by the witnesses are equally distributed with their respective electors. Furthermore, if an elected witness does not work efficiently, it is expelled and replaced by another witness. The mechanism is more efficient and faster as the number of validators is less (Yang et al., 2019). However, DPoS systems are vulnerable to centralization due to the involvement of only limited number of witnesses.

3.5.4. Proof of Importance (PoI)
PoI is a consensus scheme proposed by NEM blockchain platform that reward those users who actively participate in the network (Proof of Importance (PoI), 2015). On the basis of its importance, each participant is allotted a rating (also known as importance score) using mathematics from page ranking and network clustering. At higher level, the score calculation is based on 3 primary inputs: net transfers, currency vested and cluster nodes. The higher the importance score the more will be the chance to append a new block. POI solves two major issues prevalent in PoS. Firstly, it solves the hoarding risk as the importance score is designed in such a way that hoarding the coins will decrease the score and spending the will increase the score. Secondly, it solves the chain fork problem where participants can create blocks on either side of the chain. Therefore, carrying two chains would require two transaction designs which is not easy as it is impossible to immediately create blocks on both the chains.

3.5.5. Proof of elapsed time (PoET)
PoET relies on a fair lottery system to mitigate the resource wastage and high-power consumption. It is a consensus mechanism in which every possible validator node requests a safe random waiting time from a dependable execution system installed into the computing platform. Each participant in the overall network creates a random wait time and goes to inactive or sleep state for that particular time. The one to wake up first commits a new block to the blockchain, broadcasting the necessary information to the entire network. All the participants wait for the assigned time period and the first one to finish the designated waiting time obtains leadership for validation (Intel, 2017). The PoET consensus technique needs to ensure two important factors. Firstly, the participating nodes must select genuine random waiting time. Secondly, it is necessary to ensure that the winner has indeed completed the waiting time (Chen et al., 2017).

3.5.6. Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)
PBFT consensus mechanism is based on the method of Byzantine Fault Tolerance. Initially, a temporary leader is selected which is also replaced frequently. There are 3 phases in every block validation round: pre-prepared, prepared and commit. In pre-prepared phase, a block is proposed by the leader to the rest of the nodes. In the prepared phase, voting is carried out and the votes of the participants are broadcasted to the leaders. Lastly, if two-thirds of the total votes are in favour then the new block is appended to the blockchain. PBFT is suited for permissioned access blockchain as it can tolerate less than 33 suspicious nodes and also there is an initial filtering to select the participants for the consensus mechanism. PBFT is not scalable when the network grows (Wang et al., 2018a; Su and Vaidya, 2017).

3.5.7. Raft
Raft (Huang et al., 2020b) is a quick consensus technique used by R3 Corda (2020) and Quorum platforms (JPMorgan, 2020). The working of Raft depends on three states namely follower, leader and candidate. Follower is the starting state. After a predefined time, if the leader does not respond to the follower or the follower does not receive a signal from the leader it changes to the candidate state. Voting is done for the next leader and the maximum voted candidate becomes the leader and all other candidate returns to the follower state.

3.5.8. Proof of activity (PoA)
PoA is a hybrid consensus mechanism which is a combination of both PoS and PoW (Bentov et al., 2014). Initially, the miners attempt to figure out a hash function in a race to mine the new block which is similar to the PoW consensus. Nonetheless, the newly generated block would enclose the miner's address and a header only. At first, there are no transactions in the new block. The consensus is reached by selecting a group of validators according to the new block's header to sign the new block. Proof of stake is used to achieve this step. Although it is more secure against different attacks, this approach can face higher delay which may not be sustainable for time-restricted IoT applications (Liu et al., 2019).

3.5.9. Leased Proof of Stake (LPoS)
LPoS is a consensus mechanism that operates like PoS but can be regarded as an improved version of PoS as it attempts to annihilate the centrality challenge associated with PoS consensus. This mechanism empowers the participants with nominal balance to engage in the consensus by providing an option of leasing. Leasing here means that the wealthy participants can lease funds to the nodes with lower balance for a particular time interval. The amount to be leased will be kept by the wealthy nodes at the time of lease contract. However, the contract will boost the chances of mining blocks for participants having low balance. As soon as the block is solved by these low balance nodes, the reward will be shared with the leasing node proportionally. The LPoS consensus makes the network more decentralized and thereby increasing the overall network security (”Leased Proof of Stake”, 2020). Regrettably, LPoS is not beneficial with respect to IoT, as the concept behind IoT does not support monetary benefits which is the base for this consensus.

3.5.10. Stellar
Stellar consensus mechanism was presented by Mazieres utilizing a modification of PBFT named Federated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (FBFT) (Innerbichler and Damjanovic-Behrendt, 2018). This consensus mechanism implements micro-finance services on the blockchain platform. In FBFT, participants within the intersecting groups that are capable of performing local consensus among themselves are called federates (Sankar et al., 2017). This method permits anyone to participate in the consensus since the process is open to public and decentralized. The inherent characteristics of stellar such as low latency, low computational requirements and high throughput makes its suited for IoT systems.

3.5.11. Ripple
Ripple consensus mechanism is identical to Stellar as it also utilizes FBFT consensus mechanism. This algorithm was suggested to decrease the latency of blockchains (Schwartz and YoungsArthur, 2014). Every miner in this method uses a dependable subgroup of nodes among the larger network to establish a consensus. The nodes in the network are classified into two types based on their operations. The nodes in the first set are called server nodes responsible for performing the consensus. The nodes in the second set are called client nodes which are only responsible for transferring funds. Every server node has a Unique Node List (UNL). The participants enlisted in UNL are referred in order to reach consensus among new transactions. If 4/5th of the total nodes in UNL are in favour of the new transaction then the consensus is established. This algorithm can permit up to 20% malicious nodes in UNL (Zheng et al., 2017). Ripple is generally utilized for financial requirements to empower transactions where there are no chargebacks (Chalaemwongwan and Kurutach, 2018).

3.5.12. Tendermint
Tendermint is a permissioned consensus algorithm and belongs to the group of BFT consensus mechanisms that are able to host random application states (Tendermint, 2020). In the PBFT, every participant has equivalent voting capability whereas in tendermint, the participants have distinctive voting capabilities which directly depend on their respective stakes. Thus, it can also be considered as a hybrid combination of PoS and PBFT. Tendermint can permit mischievous activity from at most 33% of the overall byzantine voting power. This consensus algorithm has some serious benefits such as high scalability, high throughput and a very little latency. It can be moulded for IoT use cases if the monetary concepts behind this process can be replaced by other mechanisms.

Table 4 presents the comparison of different types of consensus protocols in terms of various parameters.

4. Blockchain integration with IoT
IoT is optimizing and transforming physical procedures to convert them into the elements of the digital era. In this process, piles of information are being created that are providing knowledge and insights at unthinkable levels. This data helps to improve the quality of life through the digitalization of facilities in every major sector. The implementation of IoT integrated with Cloud Computing (Munoz et al., 2018) has proved to be instrumental. Similarly, blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the current IoT structure and the integration of both can prove to be invaluable. Blockchain can provide a reliable information sharing-service where data is trusted and is perceptible. The security level escalates automatically since the data remains immutable and source of the data can be tracked at any time (Sethi et al., 2020).

4.1. Need for integration
Issues related to IoT systems (such as resource constrained end-devices, heterogeneity, privacy protection and confidentiality vulnerabilities) can be complemented using the blockchain technology (Malik et al., 2019a; Gupta et al., 2020b). Blockchain can enhance innumerable aspects of IoT and the integration of both these technologies yields several potential benefits that are enumerated below.

•
Enhanced security: The data generated from IoT devices can be protected by blockchains as the data will be stored in the form of encrypted and cryptographically signed transactions (Pan et al., 2017). Furthermore, the automatic software updates in IoT devices provided by the integration of blockchain proves to be a remedy for the vulnerable security breaches and thus improves the immunity of the entire system (Zhang et al., 2019).

•
Improved interoperability: Essentially, blockchain can provide enhanced interoperability of IoT systems by storing and modifying IoT generated data into blockchains. Different types of IoT datasets are transformed, processed, mined, resized and ultimately recorded in the decentralized distributed ledger.

•
Autonomous interactions: Automatic interaction of IoT devices is an excellent feature which can be provided by the blockchain technology. Decentralized Autonomous Corporations (DACs) (Wu et al., 2019b) are proposed for the automation of transactions involving big payment where there is no role for the traditional agencies. DACs are implemented by smart contracts and work autonomously without any human interference consequently reducing the cost. This functionality could also benefit IoT applications to implement decoupled and device-agnostic applications.

•
Reliability: Since the information in blockchain based systems remain distributed over the entire network and immutable over time, the members of the system are capable of authenticating the data and have the confidence that the data is not meddled with. Blockchain can also provide sensor data accountability and traceability.

•
Secure Code Deployment: Code can be securely and safely deployed by taking benefit of immutable storage secured by blockchain. This functionality can be used by IoT systems to safely update the device's software (Lin et al., 2018).

•
Service Market: By making the transactions between peers possible without central authorities, blockchain can speed up the development of IoT system of information and service markets, where micro-services can be effortlessly installed and micro-payments can be done securely in a full-proof environment.

•
Dependability and traceability: The data residing in the blockchain can be identified and validated wherever and whenever the user wants. All of the transactions recorded on the blockchain are traceable. Wang et al. (2019d) developed a product traceability network based on the blockchain system which ensures the availability of product tracing services to suppliers and retailers. The immutability feature of blockchain also provides the dependability of IoT data as it is nearly impossible to modify or alter the data recorded on the system.

4.2. Levels and approaches of integration
The core characteristics of blockchain such as P2P network participation, endorsing peer functionality and PoW, committing enhances the overall complexity of the network. Therefore, it is not always efficient to implement a mature blockchain-secured network in an IoT ecosystem. However, certain applications like smart grids, smart contracts, e-health systems and transportations systems might have enough facilities to assist the required P2P functionality. The employment of above-mentioned functionalities in generic IoT devices is a challenge due to the restraints in storage and computing ability of devices. Thus, the blockchain mechanisms may have to be installed in particular elements of the IoT network (Minoli and Occhiogrosso, 2018). Another scheme would be to use a basic decentralized ledger in which blocks are signed digitally along the way. Different levels of blockchain IoT integration are listed as follows.

•
End-to-End Blockchains: The source miner creates the first block that holds the transaction data. Other elements or miners in the network then append the newly mined blocks in the blockchain as the data flows through the framework to its final stage.

•
Analytics or Storage-Level: It is also similar to an end-to-end blockchain. However, the transaction is ‘exhausted’ at the analytics stage, where the information is extracted and utilized for further processing.

•
Gateway-Level: The data created by individual users is not immediately protected. As soon as the data reaches a gateway, it is combined up and stored in a blockchain along with the data from other devices.

•
Site-Level: The users at a given site individually creates data that is not immediately secured. However, as soon as the data reaches the local assembly point it is assimilated to a blockchain.

•
Device-Level: Each device has the potential as well as the forced requirement to create blockchains of data so that the data can be immediately secured.

When integrating blockchain and IoT, it is critical to decide where the communication in the IoT infrastructure will take place. This communication is classified into three different categories as shown in Fig. 5 and listed below.

•
IoT-IoT: In this approach, the IoT communication takes place with no use of blockchain. This scheme operates by storing only a small amount of IoT data in the blockchain. Discovery and routing mechanisms are required for devices to be able to communicate throughout the network. This could be the quickest approach in terms of security and latency.

•
IoT-Blockchain: IoT-Blockchain approach confirms that the important transactions are traceable as their particulars are stored in the blockchain. It enhances the independence of IoT devices. There is an immutable record of interactions as all the interactions are recorded in the blockchain. This can result in increased data and high bandwidth requirement which itself is a challenge.

•
Hybrid Approach: Here a part of the data and interactions is stored in the blockchain and the remainder data is directly shared between the devices. Fog computing and cloud computing could play a major role in complementing the drawbacks of IoT and blockchain. A major challenge here would be to choose which data should be stored in the blockchain.

Fig. 5. Blockchain-IoT integration approaches.

Despite the rapid development of blockchain technology, it is meaningless to implement it in situations where current data structures are sufficient. Depending upon the requirements of the application it can be decided when it is worth to use blockchain. For example, it may not be efficient to use blockchain only when high performance is required, but a hybrid approach can be implemented for the same to achieve the desired functionality. Still, loads of investigation and research is required for a global, real-time implementation of IoT objects as blockchain elements.

4.3. Security improvements in IoT using blockchain
With more and more physical devices joining the Internet, the system vulnerabilities expand exponentially producing numerous complex security insinuations. In IoT systems, end-devices are at a high risk of attacks such as Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), eavesdropping, message fabrication, blackhole and MITM attacks (Bhattacharjya et al., 2018; Rathi et al., 2020; Miloslavskaya and Tolstoy, 2018). As observed in botnet attacks (Kolias et al., 2017), a group of malicious devices or nodes can attack collectively to demolish the entire IoT service framework. Moreover, a central point of failure within a centralized architecture not only risks accessibility but also risks authorization and privacy (Sicari et al., 2017). Currently, security measures implemented in the IoT network are centralized, comprising of third-party agencies. A blockchain-based IoT framework is less vulnerable to falsified validation since the transaction issuing devices have their own blockchain addresses. The consensus mechanisms implemented in public blockchain systems provide prevention of DDoS attacks by imposing a fee for every transaction (Halpin and Piekarska, 2017). Therefore, the IoT security measures can be improved by implementing blockchain in the system. Utilizing blockchains for security policy prosecution and maintaining an openly inspectable ledger of IoT interactions, exclusive of the third-party security dependence, can be extremely advantageous to the IoT network. Various types of blockchain based security improvements achieved in an IoT system is explored in the subsections below.

4.3.1. Access control provision of blockchain
Many researchers have shown that enforcement of access control policies using Blockchain in the IoT network has the potential to improve the overall network security. Zhang et al. (Zhang and Wen, 2016) proposed a token-based approach in developing a blockchain supported e-business model where participants can buy access permissions for a temporary period using custom cryptocurrencies. Axon et al. (Axon and Goldsmith, 2017) proposed a multi-layer blockchain framework where data storage and access control are handled by different layers. The first layer is a decentralized data record based on blockchain for storing IoT data along with their respective blockchain addresses. The second layer handles a stream of messages to provide a discussion of access decisions among different parties. The final layer has access control operations for different individuals with different roles. In another work, Ouaddah et al. (2016) analysed another approach for access control based on tokens where different roles are assigned to users and access control protocols. In another work, Ali et al. (2017) suggested an idea where access policies were coded into the blockchain to maintain access permissions. This helps in keeping an eye on malicious activities and prevents the wastage of overall transaction fees. Shafagh et al. (2017) presented a blockchain based access control solution for data recorded in a Decentralized Hash Table (DHT). The DHT nodes identify the blockchain data to make decisions for access control. Dagher et al. (2018) proposed a blockchain based framework that facilitates an efficient, interoperable and secure access to medical records by patients, providers and third party. Ding et al. (2019) proposed to simplify the access management using an attribute-based access control technique. Blockchain is employed to record the distribution of attributes and thereby prevent data tampering and single point of failure. Lyu et al. (2020) proposed a blockchain based access control scheme to enable the provider to share, audit and revocate his content securely. Bera et al. (2020) proposed a similar framework to enable secure communication among drones. Liu et al. (2020) proposed Fabric-IoT, a Hyperledger Fabric based access control mechanism. It implements three types of smart contracts namely device, policy and access. The device contract implements a method to store the URL of resource data produced by devices. Policy contract contains functions to maintain access control policies for admin users. Access contract is the main code that implements access control techniques for normal users.

4.3.2. Data integrity management through blockchain
It is nearly impossible to create invalid blocks, alter records or hide transactions previously stored in the blockchain architecture because of the decentralized distributed consensus mechanism. Thus, it is required to decentralize IoT using blockchain since the features of blockchain mitigate the data integrity threats. Dorri et al. (2017) proposed a multi-level blockchain based framework to store piles of IoT data and maintain an unalterable record of datasets in the cloud. Liu et al. (2017) highlighted a blockchain based data integrity policy where integrity verification can be performed without the need of third-party authentication on the basis of queries. The proposed scheme relies on query issuing and data verification in order to find any data integrity loss. Yang et al. (2017) projected a credibility assessment technique based on blockchain for Internet of Vehicles (IoV). A reputation system based on blockchain is proposed which resolves the credibility of the information obtained depending upon the reputation of the source transmitter. Also, the application of blockchain for secure firmware update of IoT end devices is gaining research attention. In another work, Boudguiga et al. (2017) stated the use of consortium blockchains to record firmware updates inside the transactions, making IoT devices obtain updates in a safe, peer-to-peer environment. In another work, Hammi et al. (2018) proposed “bubbles of trust” to ensure a robust authentication and identification of devices. The proposed approach facilitates the creation of secure virtual zones named bubbles for the devices to trust and identify each other. Chen et al. (2018a) employed blockchain based stochastic scheme that distributes the load over IoT edge nodes by limiting the number of cooperative nodes. Altulyan et al. (2019) addressed the issue of data integrity from an end-to-end perspective and proposed a holistic framework relying on three concepts, namely, blockchain, fog computing and secret sharing. In another work, Wei et al. (2020) proposed a distributed virtual machine model to ensure data trust verification by enabling cooperation among multi-tenants. Jamil et al. (2020) proposed a hyperledger fabric based novel patient monitoring platform that provide patients with global access to immutable and extensive medical information. The proposed scheme outperformed the traditional scheme in terms of resource utilization, transaction latency and transactions per second.

4.3.3. Privacy guarantee through blockchains
The inherent addressing feature of the blockchain comprising of public and private keys provide built-in validation and privacy features to the blockchain applications. Aitzhan et al. (Aitzhan and Svetinovic, 2018) studied a privacy solution for smart grids focussed on hiding the identity of the energy producers. This proposed scheme does not intend to completely decentralize the environment as Distribution System Operators (DSOs) are used to maintain the security of producers as autonomous mediators. In another work, Cha et al. (2018) employed Ethereum blockchain to manage privacy among different IoT gateways that maintain Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices such as smart factory tools and wearables. The interaction among these gateways are carried out via smart contracts and remain confidential under signatures based on blockchain. Similarly, Ali et al. (Chakraborty et al., 2018a) proposed a technique where access control negotiations are maintained in the header of the blockchain where off-chain data is stored using Inter Planetary File System (IPFS). A key is provided to access the file every time a request is granted which guarantees data privacy. Hassan et al. (2019) discussed the privacy issues associated with blockchain-IoT integration focussing on the daily use applications. The work discusses five different strategies namely differential privacy, private contract, mining services, encryption and anonymization. In another work, Mohanty et al. (2020) proposed a lightweight model for smart homes that relies on three set of optimizations: distributed throughput management, certificateless cryptography and lightweight consensus algorithm. The proposed scheme achieved enhanced performance in terms of energy consumption and processing time. Gai et al. (2020) proposed a novel Internet of Edge model that integrates IoT framework with blockchain and edge computing. The proposed model is devised for a mountable and well-regulated IoT system that exploits the benefits of edge computing and blockchain to enable privacy-preserving. Lu et al. (2020) utilized blockchain to empower a secure data sharing platform for distributed parties. The data sharing problem is formulated into a machine learning problem with the help of privacy preserved federated learning model. The achieved results show that the proposed scheme enhanced security, accuracy and efficiency.

4.3.4. IoT availability improvement through blockchain
The inherent properties of blockchain such as decentralization improves the service availability in the IoT system. The on-chain data storage solution has built-in availability features whereas in the off-chain storage solution the availability depends on the mechanism used to store data. Bahga et al. (Bahga and Madisetti, 2016) created a smart factory and manufacturing units based on blockchain where manufacturing commands can be issued directly to the machines. In another work, Charaborty et al. (Chakraborty et al., 2018b) demonstrated a multilevel blockchain platform to counter the security issues in resource-restricted IoT nodes. The end-nodes interact with each other using higher-layer devices which have higher computational and storage capacity. As the higher-level devices are in a blockchain framework, the liveness of the proposal is guaranteed. Iftekhar et al. (2020) integrated the existing conventional food tracking infrastructure with the enterprise ready blockchain platform named Hyperledger Fabric. The transaction records remain secured and accessible to the stakeholders based on the agreed set of policies. Ozyilmaz et al. (Ozyilmaz and Yurdakul, 2019) proposed a standardized IoT infrastructure that is resistant and fault tolerant to DDoS attacks. The proposed system uses Ethereum blockchain, a distributed data storage platform named ‘Swarm’ and an emerging network technology named ‘LoRa’. The proposed system minimized security risks and ensured high availability.

The afore discussed blockchain based security improvements achieved in an IoT systems are summarized in Table 5.

4.4. Challenges in IoT and blockchain integration
Apart from numerous improvements, there also exists several challenges that are encountered when integrating IoT domain and blockchain technology. Some of the major challenges faced in this integration are explored in the subsections below.

4.4.1. Security
Several research works have labelled blockchain as a major requirement for the much-needed security enhancement in IoT. Nevertheless, a major challenge in the blockchain-IoT integration is the trustworthiness of the information generated by the IoT devices. Even though, blockchain provides data immutability and transaction validation but once the corrupted data enters, it will reside within the blockchain. Also, there are various risks such as rejection of services, MITM and eavesdropping (Neshenko et al., 2019). The devices are prone to be attacked or hacked preventing them from working over the security breaches or possible bugs. The Blockchain-IoT combination can have serious consequences on the communication of IoT devices. At present, the IoT application protocols like MQTT (Messaging Queuing Telemetry Transport) and CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) use the safety protocols such as DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) to provide communication (Quincozes et al., 2019). However, these schemes are heavy, complex and require supremacy of key organisation.

4.4.2. Consensus
The resource constrained nature of IoT devices make them incompatible for solving consensus algorithms, such as PoW, directly. As mentioned, there are a lot of suggestions for consensus mechanisms, though they are, generally unformed and are not tested much. Even though there are certain proposals to incorporate full blockchain nodes into the IoT objects, mining is yet a major challenge in IoT. In Babelchain (Alaslani et al., 2019), a consensus algorithm known as Proof of Understanding is suggested to target the implementation of PoW. The protocol, rather than making miners to compute hash algorithms, advises conversion from various other protocols with less energy consumption.

4.4.3. Storage capability and scalability
Scalability and storage capability of blockchains are still under debate, but with respect to IoT, these inadequacies make the implementation of blockchain in IoT a much greater challenge. In the IoT system, this drawback can prove to be an enormous obstacle to its combination with blockchain. Moreover, blockchain was not created to record huge data sets such as those generated from the devices in the IoT framework. These challenges should be addressed before integrating blockchain with IoT. At present, a lot of data gathered from the devices is stored and a small part is used for generalizing actions and extracting knowledge. Theoretically, various techniques to compress, normalize and filter data have been proposed. Data compression can improve computing tasks, transmission and storing large volumes of IoT generated data (Qi et al., 2020; Mangia et al., 2019).

4.4.4. Smart contracts
Smart contracts can prove to be beneficial for IoT but there are numerous ways in which the smart contracts can be implemented in the IoT framework. Smart contracts can ensure a dependable and safe processing engine. These contracts or codes can safely replicate the concept behind IoT applications, although certain challenges are there which should be referred to beforehand. Since the IoT structure may get unstable at times, validating and verifying these contracts could be compromised. Retrieving data from different sources could further overburden the contracts. Even though the smart contracts are decentralized and distributive, the resources to perform a large amount of processing are not shared as the execution of the contract code takes place in every node simultaneously. Smart contracts must support group mechanisms and filtering to address the requirements of IoT (Rouhani and Deters, 2019).

4.4.5. Data privacy and anonymity
Numerous IoT applications work with private data therefore, it is necessary to consider data anonymity and confidentiality. The problems of data privacy introduce greater complexity in the blockchain itself as it starts from the data assortment stage and extends to the communication and application stage (Choo et al., 2020). It is a major challenge to secure the devices, since it entails the implementation of cryptographic software into the devices. The limitation of computation resources and restriction to economic viability should also be taken into account. IoT device constraints often make it essential to secure communication using encryption standards such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Internet Protocol Security (IPSec). Trust is also a major aspect of IoT where blockchain implementation can play a vital role.

4.4.6. Legislative issues
Blockchains, especially with respect to cryptocurrencies, has brought with it a lot of controversy regarding authenticity. A country's laws and regulations about data privacy also affect the IoT domain, for example, the data protection directive. With the emergence of new technologies, majority of these laws are now becoming obsolete and are needed to be revised. The development of new standards and rules can degrade the security features of devices. In this way it can help towards building the most trusted and secure IoT network. Therefore, the laws of different countries regarding information handling and information security proves to be a big challenge in tackling IoT. The issue even deteriorates when combined with blockchain (Novak, 2019; Gürkaynak et al., 2018).

The aforementioned challenges associated with IoT and blockchain integration are summarized in Table 6.

5. Blockchain based IoT applications
Developers and researchers around the world are innovating ingenious ways to integrate blockchain in IoT systems (Alfandi et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019e). These use cases focus on taking benefits from the inherent features of blockchain such as immutability, fault tolerance, capability to run smart contracts, cryptographic security, decentralized control, data integrity and authentication. It is evident that some of the applications use patented blockchains developed for their particular needs rather than using open source blockchains like Ethereum and Hyperledger. Various types of blockchain based IoT applications are explored in the subsections below.

5.1. Blockchain-based smart home
Dorri et al. (2017) proposed a lightweight, secure and private infrastructure of a blockchain-based smart home application which is centrally managed by its owner and the miners provide a distributed key to the interacting devices as per the scheme provided by the user. This policy ensures controlled IoT data access as well as guarantees availability, confidentiality and integrity. However, the Cluster Heads (CHs), the cloud storage and the Home-Minister in this scheme provide a single point of failure at the corresponding layer. Furthermore, in the proposed scheme, it is the responsibility of the CH to decide whether to reject a block or retain it. In another work, Qashlan et al. (2019) proposed Ethereum based private blockchain implementation for smart homes where the owner can monitor and access the home appliances. Shi et al. (She et al., 2019b) proposed a homomorphic encryption-based data structure to record the transactions of a smart home and at the same time protect customer privacy. Lin et al. (2020a) constructed a novel safe mutual verification system, which can be implemented in smart homes. The researchers described the security and privacy constraints, including anonymity, traceability, and confidentiality that the proposed system fulfils. Afzal et al. (2020) presented a decentralized demand side management system for numerous smart homes in community microgrid. The proposed system is integrated with the IoT smart meter and energy consumption game is planned for decreasing the electricity cost.

5.2. Supply chain management
To ensure a product's transparency and authenticity in its overall supply chain cycle, blockchain is an ideal platform. It helps to maintain a formal registry that tracks the origin and the modifications in the products in the supply chain. In a supply chain, the sensor framework, linking storage coolers and cargo trucks can be connected to the digital ledger in order to keep the track of the location of the product. A Global Digital Ledger based on IBM Bluemix (Bluemix is nowloud:, 2017) is launched by Everledger to certify the diamonds digitally and to contribute in the avoiding of frauds. Complete information is stored by the ledger including transaction history and ownership. The organisation claims that it uses a hybrid blockchain replica in order to exploit the benefit of permission-controlled access. Malik et al. (2019b) proposed TrustChain, a three-layered consortium blockchain based trust management framework to trace communications among supply chain participants. In another work, Botcha et al. (2019) utilized the concept of blockchain and IoT edge devices to enhance traceability in pharma supply chains. Vaio et al. (Vaio and Varriale, 2020) investigated the implications of blockchain considering the decision-making process in a supply chain. Italian airport used a blockchain based collaborative decision-making platform that promotes cooperation between the air traffic controllers and the aviation industry. Liu et al. (Liu and Li, 2020) proposed a blockchain based product information traceability framework to achieve effective tag verification in cross border e-commerce supply chain. In another work, Yadav et al. (Yadav and Singh, 2020) proposed to integrate blockchain technology and supply chains to achieve sustainability. Despite having practical implementation of blockchain in supply chain management, there are still issues of implementing blockchain. Also, there are doubts regarding the condition and situation of a product in shipment to the customer which is presently done by a sensing device or a human manually. Since no other node knows the current state of the product, despite the one broadcasting it, there must be a component of reliability, such that its input is accepted in the ledger. The complete supply chain can be compromised if there is no trust (Wamba and Queiroz, 2020; Duan et al., 2020).

5.3. Impact on business models
Blockchain promotes the growth of entirely new businesses and can contribute towards shutdown of traditional incumbents. Zhang et al. (Zhang and Wen, 2016) offered a blockchain based decentralized electronic business model aimed to distribute smart properties and paid data such as a parking space, automobiles, commodities, fuel and online shopping. The proposed model relies on the idea of the Decentralized Autonomous Corporations (DACs) which is automated by smart contracts without any human involvement. The DAC model can be implemented for every sensor or device to exchange its paid information for some services like software upgradation, power and additional modules. Burer et al. (Bürer et al., 2019) considered the drivers for use cases of blockchain in energy industry and explored the role of blockchain for sustainability. Lizcano et al. (2019) evaluated the benefits of blockchain technology to manage transactions of competencies, teaching and content to eliminate the existing gap between the working world and academic world. In another work, Schneider et al. (2020) developed a theoretical framework to analyse blockchain implications on value creation. The framework shows that the blockchain technology serves as an agent, a capability, and a resource to its users. Therefore, it contributes to the emergence, enablement and efficiency gains in various business models and business ecosystems. Prybila et al. (2020) proposed a bitcoin-based business process management system for seamless verification and execution monitoring of choreographies and at the same time preserving independence and anonymity of the participants.

5.4. Security for smart cities
Conventionally, problems related to complications in distributing data retrieved from heterogeneous devices and implementing to deliver cross-functionality are faced due to unavailability of a general standard for devices. Biswas et al. (Biswas and Muthukkumarasamy, 2016) presented a secure communication framework among smart cities, based on blockchain. Authors claimed that the implementation of blockchain to the nodes in the smart city will ensure a distributed platform where all of the devices would be able to interact safely. Also, data integrity and data availability attacks will also be prevented using blockchain. It also provides an immutable ledger of transactions, that can be later used for auditing. In another work, Rahman et al. (2019) utilized spatio-temporal smart contracts to design a secure infrastructure for economy sharing in mega smart cities. Yetis et al. (Yetis and Sahingoz, 2019) utilized the distributed blockchain node structure with blocks to design a device authorization system. In another work, Sabrina et al. (Sabrina, 2019) proposed an access control model for assigning resources in a large scale IoT system such as smart cities. Access control for external users are achieved by using public blockchain and smart contracts whereas access control for internal users are achieved using local off-chain storage. In another work, Hakak et al. (Makhdoom et al., 2020) presented a blockchain based conceptual framework for securing smart cities. Makhdoom et al. (Hakak et al., 2020) proposed a blockchain based security framework named “PrivySharing” to enable secure IoT data sharing within a smart city. In order to achieve data privacy, blockchain is divided into channels having specific type of data from finite number of authorized organizations. In addition to this, the data within these channels are further secured and isolated by using encryption and private data collection respectively.

5.5. Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETS)
Conventionally, VANETS are managed by a centralized working authority. There are many limitations to this arrangement such as existence of a single point of failure and restrcited user privacy due to centralized management. Leiding et al. (2016) proposed an Ethereum based self-managing VANET for problem-reaction based verification. Each user is identified by the hash of its public key or Ethereum address and are required to pay (in Ethers) to exploit application facilities. This payment serves as incentives for vendors providing services on Ethereum-based applications. However, the work does not explain what data about each device will be recorded on the blockchain. Javaid et al. (2019) a trustless system model for VANETs that employs a certificate authority and blockchain for registering Intelligent Vehicles (IVs). Ali et al. (2019b) proposed a bilinear pairing based certificateless public key signature aimed to enable conditional privacy preserving authentication in VANETs. The proposed scheme included blockchain for efficiently implementing transparency of pseudo-entities before signature verification. In another work, Deng et al. (Deng and Gao, 2020) proposed a blockchain enabled electronic payment scheme in VANETs. Luo et al. (2020) proposed a blockchain based data structure aimed to record the trustworthiness of vehicles and provide trust-based location privacy preserving in VANETs.

5.6. Blockchain for healthcare
The traditional client-server data management systems are vulnerable to centralized data stewardship, data privacy and single point of failure. Blockchain technology promises to solve some of these inherent issues associated with healthcare systems owing to its replication mechanism and security features. Xia et al. (2017) proposed a blockchain-based system named “MeDShare” aimed to solve the data sharing issues among medical custodians. The proposed framework implements an access control mechanism and smart contracts to efficiently trace the behaviour of the data and revoke access to offending individuals in case of permission violations. In another work, Gordon et al. (Gordon and Catalini, 2018) aimed to simplify the patient-centric interoperability in healthcare using blockchain technology. Wang et al. (2018b) presented a Parallel Healthcare Systems (PHSs) framework using Artificial systems, Computational experiments and Parallel execution (ACP) as its platform in order to achieve accurate and effective diagnosis. The presented PHS framework relies on consortium blockchain for connecting patients, health bureaus and hospitals in order to enable data sharing, care auditability and review of medical records. Similarly, Griggs et al. (2018) proposed a system for maintaining Protected Health Information (PHI) by utilizing smart contracts and a private blockchain. Chen et al. (2018b) designed a storage blueprint to maintain personal medical records based on cloud storage implementing blockchain. Similarly, Omar et al. (2019) presented a patient pivotal healthcare system for data management that implements blockchain as the storage unit to obtain confidentiality. Shahnaz et al. (2019) proposed a framework for implementing blockchain in Electronics Health Record (EHR) and defined granular access user rules so as to achieve secured storage of electronic medical records. In another work, Celesti et al. (2020) proposed a tele-medical laboratory service that enables direct clinical examination of patients with the help of IoT enabled medical devices. Wang et al. (2020b) proposed a secure, productive, dynamic and decentralized consortium blockchain based framework named “GuardHealth” for secure data sharing. Apart from handling sensitive information, the proposed scheme also maintains authentication, confidentiality and efficient data preserving.

The afore discussed blockchain based IoT applications are summarized in Table 7.

6. Future challenges and research directions
Even though blockchain is a powerful technology, it is still under development and several obstacles are faced in the adoption of blockchain for IoT systems irrespective of its innumerable advantages. Majority of these challenges arise due to the utilization of blockchain technology in systems that have limited capabilities in terms of resources, scalability and privacy preservation. This section provides a brief overview of the challenges that restricts its practicality for numerous security applications discussed in aforementioned sections. Some of these challenges are explored in the subsections below.

6.1. Edge device constraints and reputation in IoT
As IoT uses traditional Internet for connecting smart devices and providing automated tasks, while integration with blockchain technology, many devices pose issues, due to limited computation and networking capabilities. Furthermore, these devices cannot process PoW consensus because of constraints on computational power and battery. Apart from this, the edge devices suffer from lack of authorization and authentication standards and limited interoperability. The interoperability can be enabled for different edge devices by implementing blockchain that is focused on storing structured and unstructured data transmission over data communication networks. Fortino et al. (2020a) analysed the role of reputation and trust in integration of IoT with fog/edge computing. The work considered intelligent agents technology for incorporating social behaviour in the smart object's community. In another work, Fortino et al. (2020b) proposed a blockchain based reputation model that relies on reputation capital of each agent. The proposed model yields better group composition and achieves protection against the misleading agents. Extension of blockchain to the IoT edge is an important research direction and several recent works have been proposed in this regard. Lin et al. (2019) developed a consortium blockchain for efficient and secure knowledge trading in edge AI-enabled IoT using smart contracts and proof of trading consensus mechanism. Xu et al. (2020a) proposed a lightweight blockchain framework using dynamic trust right algorithm to improve the throughput and transaction load in IIoT edge applications. However, the major challenge in this research direction would be to provide IoT gateways and devices with mechanisms to publish transactions on the blockchain using constrained devices, without validating blocks in a centralized pool.

6.2. Public-private blockchain trade-off
Blockchains are technologically immature to compete with the processing speed of traditional centralized systems in financial applications (Yao et al., 2019; Al-Jaroodi and Mohamed, 2019b). Even if, the transaction throughput of private blockchains are much higher, a total decentralization is not provided as the organisation itself controls the blockchain. Private blockchain consensus mechanisms, such as PBFT (Su and Vaidya, 2017), require rounds of voting to obtain Byzantine Fault Tolerance which is not appropriate for implementing in public blockchains. In public blockchains, latency depends on the lottery-based consensus mechanisms, thus a trade-off between decentralization and high speed is created by the consensus mechanisms. Therefore, this trade-off needs to further investigation.

6.3. Complex technical barriers
Numerous works have been proposed that focussed on securing IoT systems using blockchain technology. Shen et al. (2019) proposed a privacy preserving SVM scheme named “secureSVM” tha ensures confidentiality for the blockchain-based encrypted IoT data. Biswas et al. (2019) utilized the concept of local peer network to restrict the number of transactions entering the global blockchain without compromising the peer validation of transactions at global and local level. In another work, Alghamdi et al. (2020) proposed a consortium blockchain based secure service provisioning scheme and reputation-based incentive mechanism to enable fair payment among lightweight clients. However, the issues regarding security, scalability, stability constraints and graphical development of Blockchain IoT applications are still needed to be addressed. Furthermore, challenges regarding the design of validation protocols, transaction capacity or smart contracts implementation also needs to be addressed from varied angles.

6.4. IoT blockchain and cellular networks
In the rapid development of the LTE cellular network, research is in progress for finding a balanced decentralized and centralized network. The essential security features of the application layer of blockchain can be implemented in IoT edge devices by decentralizing cellular networks from the perspective of control (Haddad et al., 2020). It can also help in influencing the features provided by lower layers of cellular networks like data authentication and protection. Although most of the edge devices depend on cellular networking, the research is still at very early stages in decentralizing cellular networks.

6.5. Smart contracts scripting standards for security
Regardless of the massive security features provide by blockchain technology, there are major exploitable voids in the smart contracts that make the system vulnerable (Singh et al., 2020). Due to the open source nature of the smart contract code, it is possible for the involved parties to determine how the code is initiated and what it does. Adversaries frequently exploits the attacks related to mining pools, transaction authentication, cryptocurrency wallets and smart contracts. Parity Wallet hack and the DAO attack are the result of ingenuous bugs within the smart contract code. was an example of attackers exploiting these voids (Sayeed et al., 2020). Furthermore, assigning execution of smart contracts to machines brings some problems with it, since it makes them susceptible to technical concerns like bugs, communication failures, viruses or hacking. The immutable and irreversible nature of the blockchain framework make “bugs in coding” a critical problem. Formal validation of the contract logic and exploring precision of the contracts are some of the important areas that can serve as future research direction. Also, developing a secure smart contract scripting standard for blockchain IoT integration needs further investigation and is a strong future research direction.

6.6. Rapid field testing
Heterogenous blockchains for different applications are needed to be identified in the near future. Furthermore, the first step in combining blockchain with IoT environment is to decide the type of blockchain which satisfies the purpose (Alaba et al., 2017). Therefore, a system is mandatory for checking various type of blockchains. This can be performed in two stages namely standardization and testing. In the standardization stage, all the needed requirements are to be analysed and negotiated after deeply understanding the market, services, products and supply chains. Once the blockchain type is decided, testing and validation needs to be performed against the requirement. In the testing stage, numerous criteria need to be evaluated such as security, throughput, energy efficiency, blockchain capacity, latency and privacy. Designing an efficient standardization and testing frameworks can be another interesting future research direction.

6.7. Blockchain towards green IoT
The exponential rise in the global industry activity has contributed towards global warming due to increased fossil fuel energy consumption and technological processes resulting in high carbon footprints. Green IoT has gained considerable attention as increased energy consumption by IoT devices have diverted our focus towards realizing an eco-friendly IoT system. Green IoT aims to provide an energy efficient service by enabling the production and use of renewable energy (Janhunen et al., 2018; Poongodi et al., 2020). However, malicious IoT devices can launch energy attacks and thereby cause significant energy loss. Owing to its decentralized and secure nature, blockchain technology can contribute towards creating a secure, low-power and eco-friendly IoT system (Sharma et al., 2020). Several works have been proposed in this regard. Jiang et al. (2019) proposed a blockchain-based secure and distributed wireless power transfer architecture that offers mitigated energy loss for low-power IoT devices. Similarly, Yazdinejad et al. (2020) proposed a secure and low latency PoW protocol to improve the overall computation processing speed of blockchain based green IoT networks. However, research exploring the role of blockchain technology in green IoT ecosystems is still in its nascent stage and needs further investigation.

6.8. Incentive mechanism in BCIoT
The mining mechanism in blockchain technology involves high computational resources. IoT devices, therefore, purchase computational power from edge servers and divest the gigantic tasks. Ding et al. (2020) suggested a two-stage Stackelberg game incentive mechanism where the blockchain platform act as a leader and IoT nodes act as followers. This motivates IoT devices to purchase more computational resources for participating in the mining process. The increased sale of computational resources would result in a more secure IoT environment and at the same time assures the profits of blockchain platform. Similarly, Lin et al. (2020b) devised a similar incentive mechanism for trading energy knowledge along with optimum economic incentives and power distribution techniques using Stackelberg game mechanism. In another work, Alghamdi et al. (2020) proposed an incentive mechanism based on the reputation of Service Providers. The proposed mechanism encourages the Service Providers to leverage precise and protected services at an affordable cost to the lightweight clients. Yin et al. (2020) proposed an incentive mechanism for Mobile Crowdsensing IoT. This mechanism is crucial for active participation of multiple vehicles and task collaboration in the Internet of Vehicles network. An innovative time-window based procedure is devised to orchestrate the tasks among vehicles and also provide incentives to the vehicles to participate. In another work, Wu et al. (2018) introduced a novel incentive architecture, referred to as SmartRetro, for incentivizing and attracting distributed IoT devices to contribute in retrospective vulnerability detection and showcase results powered by blockchain. The authors performed a theoretical analysis of security and performance to demonstrate the achievements of SmartRetro. Lin et al. (2019) proposed a P2P knowledge market to make knowledge tradable in IoT enabled with edge-AI. The researchers developed a knowledge consortium blockchain for safe and well-organized management of knowledge including knowledge coins. Even though numerous incentive mechanisms have been proposed, it is still an emerging research area.

6.9. Scalability of BCoT
The state-of-the-art IoT framework still faces numerous scalability problem with respect to both devices and underlying communication. Scalability is also a major hurdle in the development of blockchain technology. Rivera et al. (2019) proposed a blockchain-framework to address the scalability and security issues in the IoT network. It is blockchain-based IoT framework in which a set of edge nodes are integrated to offer security and processing functionalities. In another work, Dang et al. (Le-Dang and Le-Ngoc, 2019) suggested an architecture for scalable reconfiguration of immense IoT devices based on blockchain technology. The IoT devices are decoupled from blockchain operations in order to minimize resource utilization using a REST API. In another work, Lao et al. (2020) demonstrated a (GPBFT) Geographic Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus protocol which is a location-based scalable consensus mechanism. The main concept behind this consensus is that a majority of Blockchain IoT applications depend upon a fixed IoT edge device for data collection and processing. The GPBFT utilizes the geographical information to reach consensus, thereby avoiding Sybil attacks. Biswas et al. (2019) proposed a local peer network-based solution to address the challenges of scalability and resource constraints in a blockchain-based IoT network. The local peer network limits the number of transactions entering the global Blockchain by implementing a scalable local ledger, without negotiating on the peer validation of transactions at the local and global level. In another work, Arellanes et al. (Arellanes and Lau, 2019) presented a DX-MAN semantics leveraging technique for apprehending distributed data flows in IoT systems. The technique is validated with the help of smart contracts and experimentally analysed to examine scalability. Similarly, Baouya et al. (2020) proposed a blockchain system for scalable management of IoT devices. The proposed system deployed smart contracts to provide the functionality of ledger update. Even though, significant amount of work has been done in this regard, new theories and technologies needs to be developed to enhance the scalability of BCoT.

6.10. Mobile edge computing (MEC) for blockchains
MEC is a standard architecture for distributed cloud computing that moves the computational overload from a centralized cloud, closer to the customer, to the edge of the network. Instead of transmitting whole data to the cloud for analysis, the edge of the network processes, stores and analyses the data for further utilization. IoT and MEC together play a significant role in modernizing the interaction of humans and the physical world. Sekaran et al. (2020) analysed the implementation of blockchain technology with 6G enabled IoT framework which utilizes the power of MEC in order to reduce the computation overload and increase overall performance and efficiency. In another work, Asheralieva et al. (Asheralieva and Niyato, 2020) studied the pricing and resource management in the IoT system which use services based on blockchain and MEC. The model use servers based on clouds to gather information from IoT nodes using a set of peers. The MEC model push the task of peers to blockchain server using Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAVs). Similarly, Kumar et al. (2020) proposed a framework known as BlockEdge to address the problems faced by current IoT networks. The BlockEdge framework is a combination of blockchain and edge computing which aids the IoT network in terms of latency, network usage and power consumption. Similarly, Xu et al. (2020b) presented Edgence for managing huge distributed decentralized applications (dApps) in IoT scenarios. It utilize edge clouds to access IoT nodes and further use in-built blockchains to accomplish self-administration and self-management on edge clouds. In another work, Wu et al. (2020) considered an IoT-Edge-Cloud Computing scenario based on blockchain technology which utilize the advantages of both MEC and MCC. The authors in this work also developed an EEDTO (Energy-Efficient Dynamic Task Offloading) algorithm by selecting the optimum computing place, either on the MEC server, MCC server or on the IoT device itself taking into consideration the joint minimization of task response time and resource consumption. Similarly, Xu et al. (2020c) explained BeCome, a Blockchain-based Computation Offloading Method. The researchers employed Blockchain to ensure data integrity in the IoT network along with MEC in order to aid offloading in cloud computing. Blockchain based 6G-enabled mobile edge computation for IoT automation needs further investigation and is a strong future research direction.

6.11. Directed acyclic graph (DAG) based blockchains
With massive advancements related to optimized authentication mechanism, efficiency, high scalability and support for multiparty environment and IoT, DAG architecture is quickly replacing conventional blockchain architectures (Pervez et al., 2018). Zhao et al. (Zhao and Yu, 2019) presented a critical analysis on two different DAG based models for blockchain namely IOTA and Hashgraph. The authors also provided an in-depth analysis on the different blockchain architectures and the challenges faced by them while combining with IoT framework. In another work, Li et al. (2020b) investigated the impact of network load on security and performance of DAG based ledger using tangle consensus mechanism. The trade-off between confirmation delay and security level acts as guidance for practical deployment of DAG blockchains. Similarly, Cullen et al. (2020) analysed parasite chain attack scenario which focuses on destroying the immutability and irreversibility of the blockchain with respect to DAG-based blockchain of IOTA foundation. Authors compared the traditional blockchain platforms with DAG-based blockchain systems in these attack scenarios. In another work, Bhandary et al. (2020) highlighted the use of blockchain technology focussing on a newer version of DAG based architecture called IOTA. The practical limitation of classical blockchain framework and the installation of IOTA for authenticated transmission of sensor data is also highlighted. Similarly, Cao et al. (2019) investigated the results of network load on DAG consensus mechanism for blockchain based IoT systems. The consensus mechanism dynamics for DAG based IoT systems are demonstrated specifically by applying Markov chain model. However, research exploring the DAG based blockchains is still in its nascent stage and needs further investigation.

7. Conclusion
The exponential rise in adoption of IoT led to the emergence of numerous security vulnerabilities ranging from attacks on data to attacks on devices. The current IoT devices are insecure and impotent of defending themselves majorly due to its resource constrained nature, immature standards, poor interoperability, absence of secure software and hardware design, deployment and development. This has drawn huge attention from the research community and numerous efforts have been carried out in order to define a robust global mechanism for IoT systems. In such an ecosystem, a decentralized, distributed technology named “blockchain” can offer solutions to the issues related to security, privacy, traceability, reliability and interoperability. Blockchain technology grants integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation by default, and utilizing smart contracts, manages automation and authorization of transactions as well.

In this paper, we presented a comprehensive survey of blockchain technology applied to resolve the myriad of data security and privacy issues in IoT. The paper throws light on the background of IoT and presents the state-of-the-art survey of blockchain technology in detail highlighting its characteristics, classification, architecture, transaction process and consensus protocols. Further, the paper discuss how blockchain technology can be leveraged to solve the most pertaining IoT security problems and highlights the major benefits and risks involved in integration of Blockchain and IoT. Moreover, the paper presents a holistic survey on major security improvements achieved in IoT systems using blockchain technology and outlines the challenges that originate during this integration. The discovery suggests that blockchain technology is an ideal and most suitable candidate for empowering IoT and realizing a safe, convenient, supervisable and transparent system that paves the way for newly emerging business models. It can be concluded that the development and deployment of blockchain based IoT systems are still in nascent stage and additional technological advances are required to address the specific demands for its broader use. Therefore, this survey points out interesting open research directions to improve security, capacity and scalability of blockchains for future effective integration of IoT and blockchain technology.
