1. Introduction
The blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and immutable ledger comprised of a cryptographically linked chain of record collection. The collection of records referred as blocks and the records called transactions or events. The decentralized ledger is shared within all contributory members in the blockchain network. These transactions add to the ledger upon verification and agreement process between the parties on-board in the blockchain. The important features associated with blockchain are the decentralization, immutability and cryptographic link.

Decentralization:The decentralization of blockchain delegate the authority among the contributors of the network. It is a distinction of the blockchain which ensure redundancy in contrast with the centralized systems operated by a trusted third party. The decentralization ensures the service availability, reduce the risk of failure and eventually improve the trust of service with guaranteed availability.

Immutability: The records of transactions in the ledger, which remain distributed between the nodes are permanent and unalterable. The immutability is a distinguishing feature of the blockchain from the centralized database systems which elevates to the next level for the integrity of data on the ledger. The records are computationally tamper resistant with the existence of the cryptographic links.

Cryptographic Link: The cryptographic link between each record sorted in the chronological order and the block builds the chain of integrity in the entire blockchain. The digital signature verifies the integrity of each record using hashing techniques and asymmetric key cryptography. The alteration of block or transaction record violate the integrity and eventually make the record and block invalid.

In addition, cryptocurrencies enable seamless peer to peer payments and proliferate the financial context accentuating as the first generation of blockchain to the world. Cryptocurrencies are virtual and digital currencies secured with digital signatures. Bitcoin (Nakamoto, 2009) is the first prominent cryptocurrency in the world which enables the peer-to-peer financial transactions without the intervention of trusted third party such as international payment channels. The system operates without a third party and the transactions committed to the network are verified by dedicated nodes called miners using the cryptographic techniques.

1.1. Significance of blockchain based smart contracts
Smart contracts are self-enforcing and self-executing programs which actuate the terms and conditions of a particular agreement or contract using software codes and computational infrastructure. Buterin et al. (2014) instigated the concept of smarts contract emphasizing the key features with the inaugural deployment in the financial industry. The smart contracts are an extension of the utilization of distributed ledger. The smart contract operates as decentralized programs on the blockchain network. The program is immutable and cryptographically verified the immutability to ensure the trust of the program. The key features of the smart contracts are execution in peer to peer mode without the intervention of a centralized third party and service availability without any centralized dependency. The autonomous execution aligned to the predefined conditions makes the contracts smart rather than paper condition.

The smart contracts' features enable the pertinence of them to diverse domains. Many of such features inherited from the underlying blockchain technology. The key features of blockchain based smart contracts can be categorized as follows.

1.1.1. Elimination of trusted third party
The blockchain is capable to operating in collaboration with decentralized nodes. The smart contracts enable autonomous execution within predefined conditions. These are the key features to resolve most of the limitations in centralized applications. The decentralization eradicates the single point of failure which ensures the ceaseless service availability. The decentralization also eliminates the extensive data consumption and latency in operations when comparing with the round trip requests of the centralized systems. The decentralization provides transparency in the computational logic eliminating the centralized “Black Box” concept transferring the accountability to all the members.

1.1.2. Forge resistance
The integrity of each transaction and block in the distributed ledger verified with the digital signatures. The forge resistance is a key distinguishing feature which augments the value of blockchain. The transaction record and the computational logic of execution are cryptographically verified and remain persistently over the network.

1.1.3. Transparency
Transaction transparency is another significant benefit of blockchain based smart contracts. The blockchain ledger and smart contract logic is visible to all parties in the blockchain ecosystem. The transparency is a differentiating feature of the blockchain which makes it lucrative among the centralized databases.

1.1.4. Autonomous execution
The programmed condition and flow of events defined to accomplished execute once the blockchain system reached to the triggering state. The triggering state can be defined in the smart contract upon agreement of all parties in the blockchain network. It can be any condition such as reduced funds, a node reaches a particular geographical location or the system receives a payment. The significant feature is that the execution is automatic and triggered on a condition of the peer without intervening a centralized third party. The service availability is guaranteed since the operation does not rely on a centralized third party.

1.1.5. Accuracy
The programmed conditions in the smart contracts are immutable and verified prior to the deployment in nodes in the blockchain network. The execution is automatic once the condition is met. The accuracy is guaranteed without any human or any other error on the execution. The autonomous accurate execution eliminates the biased operation and improves the trust through transparent accurate execution.

1.2. Paper motivation
The smart contracts facilitate the enforcement of contractual agreements with in-built transparency and forge resistance. The distinguishing features of smart contracts make it pertinent into many applications. A lot of research conducted in the industry as well as academia in order to investigate the strengths and applicability of smart contracts in different application domains. Furthermore, the improvements of technical aspects highly focused to fine tune the smart contracts for the enhancement of compatibility of the smart contracts.

2.1. Ethereum
Ethereum (Wood, 2014) is defined as a distributed computing platform which is composed of a network of computers operating in a decentralized, self-governing and democratic manner. Ethereum executes smart contracts and deploys decentralized applications which is called dApp. The front-end can be deployed as web application with associated backend as a solidity smart contract. Ethereum uses token such as ERC-20 and ERC-721 to operate with the smart contracts. Ethereum Gas is the unit to measure the computational overheads in the smart contract execution. Gas cost is the monetary value to be spent by the user for a smart contract execution. Gas limit is the maximum price which is the blockchain platform user willing to pay for the smart contract execution.

2.1.1. Advantages
∙
Open source system: The governing body of Ethereum does not charge for the source codes. The source codes available publicly and open for the contribution of developers around the world.

∙

Public ledger storage overheads: The public ledger is expected to download when a member node required to connect the network. However, the storage is growing continuously which incur some overheads in the storage for the member nodes.

∙
Transaction approval time: The transaction approval time varies from seconds to minutes which will be not supportive to the realtime requirements of transaction processing. For an instance, the retail payments are hard to accept using the Ethereum due to the transaction time.

∙
Transaction cost: The computational overheads of smart contract execution determined as the gas cost. The gas cost eventually incur financial overheads to the members in the network.

∙
Single programming language support: The programming language of the smart contract limits to Solidity, which is mostly similar to Javascript. The single programming language restricts the experts of other programming languages.

∙
Integration limitations:The integration support of the Ethereum yet to be further evolved with different application contexts such as IoT.

2.2. Hyperledger Fabric
Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned blockchain platform which is designed for the enterprise-grade usage. Hyperledger Fabric was adopted to a micro-service based architecture for convenient deployment. The ledger developed on top of CouchDB no-sql database. The smart contract called ChainCode in Hyperledger terminology can develope using Java, NodeJs and GoLang programming languages. The micro-services of a Hyperledger blockchain network includes peer, Certification Authority (CA), CouchDB, orderer, and chaincode. Each microservice deployed as a docker container. They are interconnected using remote procedure calls. Hyperledger presents an array of specialized versions and utilzation tools for the blockchain platform. Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Indy, and Hyperledger Sawtooth are the significant examples. Each version has developed with specialization in different contexts.

2.2.1. Advantages
∙
Permissioned operational capability: The permissioned operational capability provides a flexibility of the stakeholders to select which nodes to be operated, scope of ledger, and improved privacy. In contrast, the public blockchain platforms like Ethereum add transactions to the public ledger to make them publicly accessible which will raise privacy flaws.

3.1.1. Currency management
Currency is one of the most important elements in the financial industry. Currencies which are declared by a legal tender and controlled by a national central bank are called Fiat currencies. United State Dollars and Euro are well-known examples. Usage of Fiat currencies incurs the stakeholders a lot of overheads such as storage and transportation with high level of security. In the consumer's perspective, the centralized link with the central bank in fiat currency exposes the financial strength of each individual to the government. The government or bank can reverse a committed transaction without consumer's consent too. In addition to that, identity theft has become a major issue in today's financial world with Fiat currencies. The financial account information stored in the centralized systems in all leading payment organizations. The identity information such as Card Verification Value (CVV) of credit cards are vulnerable to domain expert hackers. The international remittance in Fiat currency is mostly not real-time and subject to commissions by the intervening banks.

Cryptocurrency is a revolutionary innovation of recent years to address most of these aforesaid issues. Powered by the blockchain technology, cryptocurrency is a digital asset secured with cryptographic techniques and operable with the smart contracts. Since the cryptocurrency is a “digital” asset, robust physical security is not required as the Fiat currency. Cryptocurrency transactions considered as pseudo-anonymous, since the complete identity of the sender and receiver not revealed by a third party, in contrast with the transactions routed through banks. Once committed, the transaction be recorded on a block and distributed among all the nodes in the blockchain ensures that any party cannot reverse the transaction as centralized banking transactions. The cryptocurrency transactions cannot be replayed when comparing with the credit card transactions.

Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto is the first successful cryptocurrency in the world (Nakamoto, 2009). Eventhough Bitcoin does not directly support smart contracts, there are several approaches followed by researchers to incorporate smart contracts, such as Btc (2020) and Lande and Zunino (2018). Ethereum (Wood, 2014) is another prominent cryptocurrency innovation. Ethereum is not only a platform which provides a virtual computing environment called Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), but also Turing complete programming language to write smart contracts to run on the blockchain. In currency perspective, Ethereum declares its native token called “Ether” which is a bearable digital asset.

Hu et al. (Hu et al., 2018; Manzoor et al., 2018) proposed Ethereum based payment solution for rural areas with non-persistent internet connectivity. The transactions were handled by the nodes connected to a local base station and transactions were processed by the miners and periodically connects to the synchronization of balances. Bowe et al. presented ZCash (Hopwood et al., 2016), which is an anonymous decentralized payment scheme that allows private transactions on a public blockchain using cryptocurrency. Duffield and Diaz (2015) illustrated Dash which is a privacy-centric cryptocurrency based on Bitcoin. There are significant improvements in Dash when compared with Bitcoin, such as a two-tier incentivized network and which enables private transactions and instant transfers. Rosner and Kang (2015) identified Ripple as a seamless payment scheme that enables cross-border transactions seamlessly. The authors pointed out the significance of regulatory authorities to regulate the transactions committed on decentralized payment systems.

3.1.2. Know Your Customer
Anonymous customers are restricted in almost all banks in the world to prevent money laundering and other illegal activities. Preliminary information such as names, addresses, social security numbers and contact numbers recorded by the banks after a formal customer screening process. If spurious activities are committed by the customers, those activities can trace and map along with their identities for further investigations. Every bank adhered to their own specification of Know Your Customer (KYC) process. This process includes a lot of paperwork and usually does not have a standardize way for cross-bank verification of an individual. The people conceal their identities in money laundering activities due to non-standardization and most of the times banks will be penalized for such criminal activities. In addition to that, the customers do not have authority to control the ownership of data.

In this regards, the incorporation of smart contracts can emancipate most of the awkward manual operations while enhancing the privacy preservation. Data alterations are traceable by both the bank and customers through the distributed ledger. Customers will have the ownership of data and can control the access to data to eliminate misuse of data. Anyone who need to access the data, has to request permission from the customer. Smart contracts can be used to enable such access dynamically. In addition, the distributed data storage enhances the single point of failure and risk of data loss as well. The blockchain based data storage ensures the availability of the service with its distributed service architecture.

Guo and Liang (2016) discussed the benefits and how the smart contract transformation will revolutionize the banking industry. The author suggested that all data should store in the financial institutions in encrypted form and a summarized version of data should be shared to the public ledger. Moyano and Ross (2017) proposed an Ethereum based KYC system to reduce the operational cost and enhance the customer experience. The authors also discussed the capability to incorporate permissioned blockchain such as Corda for the system. Biryukov et al. (2018) proposed privacy preserving KYC scheme on Ethereum, which leverages the customer onboarding with compliance to the regulatory requirements. The system defined two smart contracts naming KycProvider and KyceToken. Each smart contract maintains access related information and functioning as standard ECR - 20 token for the KYC checks.

3.1.3. Escrow service
Escrow is an essential service in the online international trading marketplaces. Escrow is a widely used technique to exchange funds in the international transactions. It acts as the trusted mediator in classical international trade ecosystems. Since there is no face-to-face meetings and physical contract establishment in the online international transactions, a trusted intermediary is a mandatory service. Escrow services require a service charge which a certain percentage of the transaction value. The present escrow services have non-realtime settlement processes with non-standardized dispute resolution mechanisms.

This requirement of a trusted third party in the escrow service is fueling the use of autonomous platforms such as blockchain based smart contracts. Application of the smart contract eliminates the transaction delays. The smart contracts enable near real-time settlements and the embedded rules will charge the penalties for delayed payments and delivery. The distributed service architecture of the smart contract will eliminate the single point of failure and ensure the service availability to streamline the business.

Peters and Panayi (2016) discussed the blockchain technology, smart contracts and its application in the global money remittance. The author discussed the possibility of multi-signature escrow services with smart contracts. The author also highlighted the key requirement of the smart contracts anticipated in the escrow including accuracy and trust. Bogner et al. (2016) demonstrated a decentralized Ethereum based application for sharing tangible objects in everyday use. The solution implemented associating a web application and a mobile application that is capable of reading a QR code displayed on the objects. The system utilizes an escrow service to hold the associated fees as per the requirement.

3.1.4. Insurance
Insurance is an essential service to the people for centuries. People insured numerous assets such as properties, vehicles, businesses and their own lives. Any insurance agreement composed of an insurer, organization which provides the insurance and the policy which are often formed as paper contracts have a longer process in agreements. In addition to that, the insurance frauds are accountable as more than 40 billion dollars a year, according to Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) statistics (Insurance Fraud, 2020). The claiming and settlement process takes time which is unfair customer experience.

The use of smart contracts in the insurance industry will be beneficial in multiple dimensions. The smart contract can be utilized to establish insurance policy terms and conditions in an immutable manner. No human intervention is required to settle a claim. Smart contract based auditing and verification process will be straightforward than the manual process with the globally distributed public and immutable ledger.

Hans et al. (2017) emphasizes the usefulness of blockchain based smart contracts in the insurance industry. Authors stated that smart contacts can speeds up the claim processing and eliminate the administrative costs. The authors also highlighted that still there are some aspects including scalability, flexibility, and permissioned operation to be improved before integrate the smart contract into the insurance industry. B3i (Allianz, 2020) is one of the most significant innovations to the insurance industry in collaboration with fifteen giants in the sector. The smart contract based systems improve the insure and re-insure value chain as well as improve customer experience in KYC process. In Crawford (2017), authors illustrated the possible improvements in the insurance industry by using blockchain based smart contracts. The authors highlighted the enhanced customer satisfaction through unified KYC process, fraud detection since each claim transaction requires to verify by the number of parties to being approved, automation of claim processing, and innovative product integration capability such as micro insurance.

Guo et al. (2018) proposed WISChain, which was intended for web identity security. They provide two insurance service models for web identity security and commercial website security, which enables the claim evidences to be uploaded automatically to the blockchain. Bird (2018) illustrated a convenient crop insurance for farmers in Ghana. The smart contracts have been defined to compensate the policyholders due to certain conditions such as drought or rainfall utilizing high resolution satellite images to identify the weather conditions to eliminate fraudulent claims. Etherisc White Paper (2017) illustrated Etherisc, which is a decentralized and smart contract based insurance system which defines two types of tokens for economic incentivization and to represent risks respectively. It was utilized Ethereum smart contracts to establish a standardized set of rules to define how stakeholders should function in the system. Vo et al. (2017) presented a permissioned blockchain-based solution for the data provenance in car insurance. The system was implemented using the Hyperledger Fabric platform. The smart contracts were invoked in capturing events such as weather events, location variations of the car, and so on.

3.1.5. Lending and borrowing
Lending, borrowing and loans are significant economic activities of a civilized nation which are important in the economic development. The economic development made the human needs sophisticated. The lending methods also diversified among different avenues as per the human needs. Peer to peer lending was a famous mode since the ancient economic ecosystems. This was transformed into flexible syndicated products presented by major financial institutions. Here, banks act as trusted third parties. Banks are the only authorized repository of money for lending and dominate the lending market. The current mortgage and loan processing often spans about 60 days (Average Loan Processing Time, 2020). This arduous process includes ascertaining loan applicants' credit scoring, and underwriters' profile verification.

In addition to that, the loans were subject to processing fees and few other surcharges imposed by the bank. Some hidden charges can surprise the customers too. Borrowers sometimes escape and refuse to pay back the loan.

The smart contracts circumvent the existing issues and promise a trust based ecosystem which streamlines the application and payment with automatic execution. The smart contracts can automate the different manual processes which hinder the loan processing, utilizing the distributed ledger. Credit scoring, expense history analysis are few possible solutions which can be ideally replaced with the smart contracts to improve the process. Salt Lending (Salt Lending White Paper, 2020) is world's one of the largest lending platforms with market capital of USD 126 millions. The borrowers send collateral to Salt's multi signature wallet in according to enforced conditions automatically. ETHLend (2020) is an Ethereum based lending platform. The important attributes such as loan terms, fund transferring conditions, and collateral are being handled by smart contracts with ERC-20 tokens. Everex (Blockchain-Powered Money Transfers, 2020) is a Singapore based lending and remittance service. Everex provides a transparent platform for the unbanked customers in South East Asian countries. It uses ERC-20 token which can be pegged with fiat currencies. Debitium (Debitum Network, 2020) is one of the Ethereum based crowdfunding platforms. It facilitates cross border deals and connects borrowers and investors.

3.1.6. Auditing procedures
The Auditing is a significant activity in an organization. Due to regulatory requirements, the organizations have to undertake the audit through a trusted independent third party organizations. These organizations charge explicitly for their operations. The audit operation is a tedious manual process which requires substantial human intervention. The derived insights from the audits will depend on human accuracy.

Audit procedures associated with smart contracts automate the audit procedures and eliminate the additional costs and human errors. The accuracy is guaranteed by the autonomous execution of smart contracts in real-time. Due to the distributed and transparent nature of the smart contract, the regulatory authorities can trust the executory conditions are not being tampered. Also the smart contracts can customize to derive deeper insights for data analytics.

Zou et al. (2020) proposed a blockchain based audit scheme to eliminate forging of audit records. Rozario and Vasarhelyi (2018) explained the applicability of smart contracts in the auditing procedures. Still the auditing require some more contribution of the blockchain based solutions.

3.1.7. Stock trading service
Stock exchange is one of the most prominent activity in a financial structure. Most of the countries trade stocks valued in millions of dollars per day within traders. These traders are ranging from individual investors to multi millionaire public listed companies. Each transaction executes by intervention of different parties including brokers of the buyer and the seller, clearing houses and transferring agents. The current setup imposes commissions and charges on each player and prone to human errors. Sometimes the settlement is not realtime. Furthermore, the fiat currency based architecture operates with centralized governance architecture which limits the market access restricted to the people. The stock trading market access controlled through the registered brokers, which introduced additional overheads of time and cost to the people who are interested in trading.

The centralized trading architecture can be eliminated by incorporating smart contracts and will enable peer to peer transaction capability for the traders. The terms and conditions can be established transparently by using smart contracts. There is no centralization of trust is required since the ledger is decentralized and the network guarantees the conditions are immutable over the network. Therefore, smart contracts will empower the next generation stock exchanges eliminating human errors, centralization and additional charges incurred on traders along with faster settlement.

Yermack (2015) discussed the advantages of blockchain based smart contracts for corporate governance and how financial asset trading will be benefited from smart contracts. The author emphasized that the improvement of tracking the ownership with public ledger will be accurate in financial record-keeping with greater transparency as well as improve the liquidity. The author elaborated that countries including the USA and Australia started experimenting with smart contract powered security trading platforms. TITA Project Whitepaper (2020) presented TITA which is an Ethereum blockchain based system which supports commodity trading for manufacturers and consumers. The system defines a token to enable purchases and transfers and incentivizes the token generating contributors of the network. Smart contracts transfer assets or establish escrow conditions as required. ASX Details Timeline (2020) is a prominent application of permissioned blockchain based smart contract application for stock exchange in Australia. It provides automated clearing and settlement by smart contracts along with some significant post-trade activities. They provided Digital Asset Modeling Language (DAML) and run privately on a defined set of nodes. Hong Kong Stock Exchange (2018) and World's First Blockchain (2019) in Hong Kong developed by following the Australian Stock Exchange implementation.

3.2. Health care related services
The research and development in the health care domain have increased the life expectancy. As a result, the number of elderly people in the world who will require periodical medical attention is gradually increasing. New insurance schemes such as Affordable Care Act enrollment in the USA increased the number of patients seeking preventive medicine who were previously reluctant on medical care due to financial constraints. These reasons increased the volume of patients significantly over the past few decades. Handling such an unprecedented volume of patient data manually is a cumbersome process. Manual processes incur significant administrative overheads and prone to life critical human errors. The digital transformation will eliminate these issues associated with the manual process but exposed to an array of data security threats. If these information systems integrated with prescription drug operations, the complexity and security requirement of the ecosystem will be increased drastically.

Therefore, incorporation of the smart contracts to the health care ecosystem will be significantly effective in different dimensions. A quick overview of smart contract applications on healthcare displayed on Fig. 4. Table 6 summarizes the applications of smart contracts in the healthcare context along with the benefits and challenges. Candereli et al. (2020) explored the opportunities in healthcare with a scientometrics analysis. McGhin et al. (2019) presented a comprehensive review on research challenges and opportunities in the blockchain in the healthcare context.

3.2.1. Health information management
Modern medical institutions are mostly empowered with automation techniques to handle the myriad volume of patients. The IoT integration is a wider domain including remote treatments and real-time monitoring. These systems generate a massive amount of patient data which is confidential and life critical. But most of the systems in some countries are not compliant with international standards such as the Health Insurance Portability and Privacy Act (HIPAA). Some systems are still rigid and still may require some paperwork. The health information system must ensure data privacy and integrity, as well as availability. These services are indispensable in the health context rather than the other industries because the medical information is highly relevant in invaluable life assets. The blockchain technology and smart contracts can be applied to enable the health information management systems to ensure privacy, integrity and access control to achieve regulatory compliance along with the enhanced patient experience.

Azaria et al. presented MedRec (Azaria et al., 2016), a decentralized electronic health record management system which enables the patients to access their medical records across multiple treatment sites. The system is being leveraged by the blockchain and smart contracts, developed on Ethereum platform and manages authentication, confidentiality, accountability and data sharing with a crucial consideration on sensitive patient information. The system is interoperable with existing medical record eco-systems. Nichol and Brandt (2016) presents a concept for co-creation of trust in healthcare, using three conceptualized postulations as interoperability, security, and payment. The authors explained with examples clearly how the blockchain based smart contracts will solve different problems in healthcare including the trust establishment and frauds. The authors defined blockchain based smart contracts will be a game changer in future of healthcare.

Kuo and Ohno-Machado (2018) presents Modelchain, an adaptation of blockchain based smart contracts for the privacy preserving healthcare predictive modeling framework. The authors designed a framework to integrate online machine learning with blockchains and utilized transaction metadata for the predictive model dissemination. The authors designed a new proof-of-information algorithm on top of proof-of-work conesus algorithm to determine the order of online machine learning on blockchain. Dagher et al. (2018) proposed Ancile, which enables secure, interoperable, and an efficient access control framework to medical records by the patients along with privacy preservation using Ethereum smart contracts. The solution transfers the ownership and control of the patient himself. The system developed with six smart contracts for operations including consensus, classification, ownership of data, permissions and re-encryption and maintains hashes of the records for integrity. The system enables data ownership transfer permission to the patient and compliant with HIPAA requirements. Yue et al. (2016) proposed Healthcare Data Gateway (HDG), which is a blockchain powered mobile application allows patients to control the access of medical data by his own to ensure patient data privacy. The authors portrayed the application of Secure Multi-Party Computation on patient data to enable untrusted parties to compute patient data within privacy limits defined. The system used blockchain storage platform to manage data by the patient and the authors discussed about new hopes on 5G to faster data manipulation with enhanced network speed.

Novikov et al. (2018) presents a blockchain based smart contract based distributed data register for creation of electronic medical card and an algorithm for the use of smart contracts. The authors have highlighted the establishment of reliability and transparency through blockchain and its significance on the medical information system. The authors suggested Ethereum platform for development of the suggested Integrated Electronic Medical Record register. Alexaki et al. (2018) presented a conceptual medical record access and sharing mechanism powered by blockchain based smart contracts. The authors suggested development of the system based on either Ethereum or Quorum, which is the permissioned version of Ethereum blockchain. The authors applied smart contracts for significant roles including identity registration, patient record management and electronic patient record access agreement. Kuo et al. (2017) presented an open discussion on the benefits, pitfalls and latest applications of blockchain based smart contracts to the biomedical and healthcare domain. The authors discussed the key benefits including improved medical record management, enhanced interfacing with insurance systems for the claiming process, accelerated clinical and biomedical research and data transparency and enhanced medical ledger with robustness and security. The authors discussed the key challenges of blockchain in healthcare is the publicly available health records.

3.2.2. Clinical research data protection
The data integrity of clinical trials is a major concern in medicine. The data integrity defined as the extent which the electronic and paper based data are complete, consistent, accurate, trustworthy, and reliable throughout the data lifecycle. There are guidelines such as International council for harmonization guideline for good clinical practice established to regulate the data integrity in different perspectives. The significant problems of the credibility of scientific data are data loss, endpoint switching, data dredging and selective publication. The treatments due to distorted data will expose the patients into a life risk. The paper based systems do not guarantee the integrity of data. The risk exists of losing the printed or hand-written papers where the data rests. Eventhough the computer systems utilized, still some robust security measures should be applied to prevent data loss and theft. Sometimes, the digital form of data will be more vulnerable than paper written data. The clinical research data repositories associated with smart contracts will be the ideal solution to enforce access control and regulatory compliance.

Nugent et al. (2016) signified the enforcement of regulatory requirements and trust in clinical research data by blockchain based smart contracts using Ethereum platform. The smart contracts, naming as regulator contract and the trial contracts acted as trusted administrators of the system. The authors utilized two smart contracts. The regulator contract holds a data structure for clinical trial authorization while the trial contract is built using functions within the authorization contract. Zhang et al. (2018) proposed a framework on managing and sharing electronic medical records of cancer patient care using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform along with symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques as well as proxy re-encryption. The authors proposed that privacy, security, availability, and fine-grained access control over medical data ensured and mainly focused on the secured sharing of medical data, for research or treatment requirements between medical organizations. The smart contracts eliminated the requirement of trusted third party and ensures privacy and access control policy defined by the patient and used encryption techniques to store the data on the ledger. When comparing Zhang et al. (2018) with Nugent et al. (2016), there are significant differences can be identified. Nugent et al. (2016) was built on Ethereum smart contract, which is a public blockchain. The public blockchain transactions are cost intensive with account management and mining contribution. In contrast, Zhang et al. (2018) implemented on Hyperledger Fabric private blockchain which provides flexibility for the stakeholders to regulate. For an instance, Hyperledger Fabric enables the nodes to define consensus policy according to their preference.

3.2.3. Automated patient monitoring and treatment
The IoT and wearable devices have been embraced by people from smartwatch to Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN). The WBAN leverages IEEE 802.15.6 and IEEE 802.15.4j standards which were specifically standardized for medical WBANs. The core objective of WBAN is to improve the communication speed, accuracy, and reliability of sensors attached in the immediate proximity to the human body. The WBAN sensors may generate a massive amount of data such as blood glucose level, the pulse rate, blood pressure, and so on. The expansion of such systems raised the requirement of privacy, access control and integrity of data. Each device should be operated with robust automated access control mechanism to eliminate the risk of the patient. Rogue access to the automated patient monitoring and treatment system can kill the patient within few seconds by jamming the treatments. The smart contracts will be the next generation solution to eliminate the risks by controlling access and autonomous safe execution of the treatments in automated patient monitoring and treatment systems.

Griggs et al. (2018) proposed a system which utilizes private Ethereum blockchain and master-slave modeled medical device deployment model. The sensors connected with the smart device, such as either a smartphone or tablet. The sensors can connect to apparatus such as insulin actuators and blood pressure monitors to execute smart contracts and eventually the records will transfer to the immutable ledger. The data received by the smart device is sent to the smart contract, along with the customized threshold values and smart contracts evaluate the data and trigger alerts to the patient, healthcare provider and instructs to the actuator nodes for automated treatment if required.

3.3. Identity management and access control
Identity management and access control are essential services in every enterprise. The classical identity management systems are mostly centralized and associated with expensive hardware such as smart cards and hardware security modules. Centralized systems will elevate the risk single point of failure and require a robust backup, recovery and disaster management procedures. There are scalability limitations exist in the centralized systems. Sometimes the latency in identity management and access control can be observed when they were connected to IoT devices due to computational power limitations.

The distributed ledger technologies will be the next generation of identity management and access control systems. Smart contracts based access control systems promise accuracy, high availability, and fault tolerance. Table 7 summarizes the applications of smart contracts in the identity management and access control context along with the benefits and challenges.

3.3.1. Identity data protection
The value of personal identity information is proliferating with the association of modern technologies to the human life. The devices such as smartphones, wearables generate enormous amount of personal data such as location, identity information and so on. Most of the leading applications, including social media used by the people are centralized and the user has minimal rights to control the data. Still most of the users are unaware of the significance of their personal information. The incidents like Cambridge Analytica Scandal reflect that the capability to abuse the personal data without the owners' consent (Facebook Cambridge Analytica, 2021). Data owners should be capable of controlling the access of their data to avoid such incidents.

The smart contracts are a blessing solution for the access control of identity information and eliminate data theft. The decentralized nature of smart contracts will enable the data owners to control the access of their own data with decentralized and transparent nature. The distributed ledger is applicable to record the access of the individual personal data, which ensures that the data did not access unnecessarily, such as for a third party.

Banerjee and Joshi (2017) proposed a novel framework associated with blockchain based smart contracts for users to track how is their personal identity information is stored, used and shared by the service provider. The authors developed an automated access control and audit mechanism which enforces users' data privacy when sharing data across third parties. The authors also mentioned that their system can be adopted by big data users to automatically apply their privacy policy on the data flow and track operations. Ouaddah et al. (2016) present a blockchain based privacy preserving authorization management framework which enables users to control their own data. The authors implemented the initial implementation on the typical IoT use case on Raspberry Pi. There are few types of transactions used to grant, get, delegate, and revoke access.

3.3.2. Decentralized identity management
Classical identity management and access control systems such as LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), IAM(Identity and Access Management) and PKI(Public Key Infrastructure) are aligned with common centralized architecture. The centralized identity management systems developed with privileged access management to the administrator(s) which enable the administrators to manipulate data, central point of failure and expensive perimeter security requirements for compliance. The access credentials associated with private keys will be vulnerable if they are stored in a centralized server, probably in the cloud. Perimeter security requirements will incur costs to the organizations to deploy expensive Hardware Security Modules and tokens with extensive administration and maintenance overheads. If a rogue user disables the centralized service, entire system will be affected.

Instead of the centralized access control systems, the decentralized system will heal many pains of centralized access control. The smart contracts will provide access to the individual user without invocation of centralized service and in network efficiency perspective, optimal than the centralized systems. The smart contract logic will be transparently deployed and the users can guarantee that their access control or identity information not manipulated by a privileged access management personal. The distributed nature will ensure the service is up and running and cannot be halted by attacking a single server.

Zhang et al. (2019) investigated critical access control issues in IoT and proposed a smart contract based access control system with multiple access control contracts. The authors defined three contract types, as the access control contract, judge contract and register contract. The authors demonstrated the framework using IoT system and a desktop computer. Es-Samaali et al. (2017) proposed a blockchain based access control framework to reinforce the security of bigdata platforms. The key features included the distributed nature and lack of central authority with transparency, light weight, fine granularity. They authors defined an authorization token which defines the access right by the creator of the smart contract. SCPKI (Al-Bassam, 2017) is an alternative PKI system with decentralized and transparent design used with smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain. The main advantage of the system is to identify the rogue certificates with he web-of-trust model when they are published. The model enables an entity or authority in the system can verify fine-grained attributes of another entity's identity.

Blendcac (Xu et al., 2018a) is decentralized smart contract based access control solution for devices, services and information in large scale IoT systems. The authors proposed a robust capability token management strategy which utilizes smart contracts for registration, revocation and propagation of access authorization. The authors developed a PoC on private blockchain on the resource constrained devices which is raspberry pi and laptops and demonstrated the feasibility. Lin et al. (2018a) presented a blockchain based fine-grained access control framework for the Industry 4.0.

Ali et al. (2017) proposed a decentralized access model using blockchain for IoT data using a network architecture naming as modular consortium architecture. The architecture has in-built privacy with adaptability for various IoT use cases. The feasibility and deployment considerations for the implementation analyzed in a performance evaluation of existing blockchain development platforms including Ethereum and Monax. Lee and Kim (2018) pointed that in the IoT environment, when data or device authentication information appended to the blockchain, there is a risk of the information leakage through proof-of-work process or address searching. They authors applied a zero-knowledge proof to a smart meter system and enabled the transaction processing through disclosing the information such as public key. They authors also studied the avenues to enhance the anonymity of blockchain for privacy protection.

3.3.3. Security policy in access control
Security policy is a core regulatory component in any organization as well as Internet applications. The security policy defines the required security controls aligned with the organization's strategic rules and regulations. The depth of access of the users for the infrastructure or resources will depend on the security policy. The centralized security policy and governance architecture is one of the mostly adopted architecture for most of the organizations. With the centralized security policy management, the capability to customization is cumbersome. For an instance, if the employee promoted to the next level, the scope of accessible resources required to expand. Customization of the centralized security policy incurs additional overheads. If the organization deployed beyond frontiers, the overheads will be more. Furthermore, there is a risk of manipulation of centralized security policy without user's consent.

The smart contracts promise the autonomous execution of the program once the predefined conditions met and an ideal solution for decentralized security policy management. The security controls can define as programs and deploy in the smart contracts. The autonomous execution eliminates the overhead of human intervention in the security policy. The distributed nature of the blockchain based smart contract guarantees that the execution logic is not being manipulated by either an administrator or any rogue user within the organization. The decentralization ensures the transparency as well as the availability of the security policy management system.

Cruz et al. (2018) presented a role based access control using Ethereum smart contracts. The smart contracts used for the creation of user role assignments and eventually published to the blockchain. The smart contract provides significant features including managing and modifying information as required in a transparent manner. Outchakoucht et al. (2017) proposed dynamic and fully distributed security policy implemented with smart contracts. In addition to that, the authors proposed to apply machine learning algorithms, particularly on reinforcement learning for dynamic, optimized and self-adjusted security policy. The smart contract learns from prior experience to adjust the optimal security policy. Lyu et al. (2020) proposed blockchain based access control mechanism in the information centric networking context. Ali et al. (2019) proposed blockchain based access control mechanism for conflict of interest domain.

3.4. Real estate
Commercial real estate industry composed of various transaction types such as leasing, rental and purchases with different asset classes including commercial properties, houses, lands and so on. The government authorities such as national land registry handle all information of the real estate ownership, leasing and so on. Transferring ownership and leasing transactions performed with the intervention of few trusted third parties. Such operations are manual and exposed to human errors, data manipulation risks and extensive processing time.

Smart contracts will be the next generation solution which will revolutionize the real estate trading industry by a storm with enhanced security and optimized processing time. An overview of smart contracts in real estate context displayed in Fig. 5. Table 8 summarizes the applications of smart contracts in the real estate context along with the benefits and challenges.

3.4.1. Improved secure transaction process
Multiple fraudulent transactions can be identified in the real estate industry. When the title of the asset, either a land or house is represented by a printed document, the authenticity of document cannot be easily verified. There are cases where a person can fraudulently duplicate the title document and submit to multiple banks as security asset to obtain a loan. The authenticity of paper title cannot verify in realtime by the current centralized systems. There are cases the land owner sells a land to multiple people using the duplicated paper titles. The key problem is that the authenticity of paper title issued by a trusted third party cannot be verified by the individuals.

Smart contracts eliminate the lead time for a title transfer and the transparent conditions will hiccup the fraudulent ownership transfer approaches. The ownership information stored in the public ledger and the parties such as banks can verify the ownership of the security.

Karamitsos et al. (2018) examined design of Ethereum smart contract for the use cases of real estate, which is renting residential and business buildings. The authors proposed that the smart contract created between landlords/real estate owners and tenants which verifies that the rental agreement is signed, rental amount paid on time, and the contract terminated correctly. The authors also highlighted the improvement of the invoicing process through the smart contracts and stated that they need to asses the same use case with Hyperledger Fabric. Spielman (2016) presented the blockchain application for the land title registry. The key advantages discussed the elimination of the centralized database in the land registry with enhanced security. Since all parties are involved in the consensus, the incapability of fraudulent transactions in the land title ledger was highlighted. Dijkstra (2017) presented different possibilities and constraints for the blockchain in the real estate management process. The research conveys that blockchain is still required to improve different dimensions such as government regulation, standardization and so on. The interviews conducted in the research reflect significant insights such as digitally signing the lease contracts and monitoring the obligations via smart contracts are the most important applications of blockchain in the real estate management process.

3.4.2. Processing fees and commissions for transactions
The trust establishment of real estate industry accomplished with the intervention of few trusted third parties such as government bodies and banks. These organizations incur processing fees and commissions such as stamp duties for their maintenance. The fees are not negligible when the transaction value is million dollars.

Smart contracts eliminate the requirement of a trusted third party since the transfer executes the smart contract itself. Elimination of the trusted third party executes the ownership transfer in real time without processing fees and will reduce unnecessary costs to the consumers.

Oparah and Oparah (2016) highlighted the importance of smart contracts for elimination of costs incurred by the trusted third party. The cost is around 1–2% of the total value of the property which is not negligible. The importance of smart contract and the enablement to transfer the ownership between two homeowners legitimately without paying for third party verification.

3.4.3. Extensive processing time
Current systems are mostly oriented with the centralized authorities. The centralized organizations handle the documents related to the ownership of lands such as titles. Sometimes the documents reside on owner's district or state local authority. This type of architecture consume time to deliver documents to each local authority and update information. In contrast, the smart contracts will execute in real-time or near real-time to transfer ownership which eliminates logistics problem and reduce costs.

Fernandez et al. (2020) proposed Evareium, which is a smart contract system for trading commercial property. The investors can trade ERC20 compliant tokens issued from Ethereum blockchain and utilize them to fractions of underlying property assets linked to the tokens. The system provides a faster, reliable and transparent platform for trading a plethora of real estate assets such as commercial properties and hotels.

3.5. eGovernment/law
Transformation of the government services and legal enforcement into the electronic genre grabbed attention by most of the nations including Europe, Asia, and many other regions. From the electronic services of government, the stakeholders anticipate different features. These include trust, accuracy and improved efficiency as well as user satisfaction. The increased population and complexity of the human needs escalated the requirement of automation to cope with enormous demand volume. Regardless of the service type, the eGovernment solutions handle personal data of the civilians. Uninterrupted service availability is also expected by the stakeholders. Blockchain based smart contracts are one of the most promising solution with significant features for eGovernment services as well as legal enforcement. Table 9 summarizes the applications of smart contracts in the eGovernment and Law context.

3.5.1. Enforcement of law
The legal system of any country is complicated and consists of numerous terms and conditions. In a broader view, almost all conditions executed with the direct intervention of judicial personal after a certain assessment. For an instance, if a driver exceeded 10 percent of the speed limit, there is a predefined penalty. If he exceeded 20 percent, the penalty is even higher. The conditional execution intervened with a human. For more complicated cases, the assessment duration is exorbitant which can drag upto years. The human intervention exposes decision to human error. Therefore incorporation of the smart contract for legal enforcement is important because it enables the autonomous and accurate legal execution. However, all the legal terms cannot develop directly as smart contracts. Some straightforward terms are possible to deploy as smart contracts.

Raskin (2016) examined the smart contracts' operation and its position in the existing contract law. The author distinguished the smart contracts as strong and weak, corresponding to the costs of their revocation and modification. The author also highlighted the significance of encouragement of smart contracts by the legislature as another form of agreement. Savelyev (2017) examined the key tensions between classic contract law and smart contracts. The author also analyzed the alignment of powers of government on distributed ledgers without a central authority. The author suggested two main approaches to achieve the requirement. O'Shields (2017) examined the potential use cases of blockchain based smart contracts along with their technical limitations and barriers. The author also described the legal and regulatory issues associated on the adoption of smart contracts. The legal changes which should be enacted to realize the benefits of technology also discussed in the article. Koulu (2016) explained application of self-executory smart contracts and blockchain technologies along with their application to online dispute resolution. The author described the logic behind smart contracts with a more concrete example on a betting on weather of a given location. The article provides a further analysis of legal implications outside its application of virtual currency.

Levy (2017) analyzed in depth the smart contract and its role to automatically execute the obligations without a centralized enforcement authority. The smart contract and its implication for social justice and fairness also discussed in the paper. The potential weaknesses of the smart contracts in the legal perspective discussed. de la Rosa et al. (2016) presented application of the smart contract for the intellectual property protection for open innovation programmes targeted on small to medium enterprises. The users sign smart contracts as non disclosure agreement with timestamping with the corrective actions as required. The solution provides a smart contract based fine grained intellectual property management for open innovation programmes.

Tietze and Granstrand (2020) presented a distributed ledger based approach to automate the intellectual property licensing payments. Lauslahti et al. (2017) analyzed the smart contract from the perspective of digital platforms and the Finnish contract law. The authors also examined the formation mechanisms of the general principles of contract law in the application of smart contracts. The adaptability of smart contracts as the current legislation also evaluated. Watanabe et al. (2015) proposed a method of recording the classical contracts. The authors utilized a transaction to evidence the contractor consent and information. The authors used encryption to keep preserve the confidentiality of the contracts.

3.5.2. Contractual agreements
A contract is an agreement made between two or more parties with legal binding and enforceable by law. Contractual agreements in the business are composed with precisely defined terms and conditions. The terms and conditions are significant to the parties on the contract because they will set rights and obligations as well as price variation clauses for each. Classical contracts formed with the intervention of a trusted third party such as the notary. The on boarding of the trusted third party to form a contract incurs service charges. Most of the times, the trusted third party is a human and hence the risk of human error also exists. The terms and conditions can be manipulated by the third party if required.

The smart contracts are applicable to solve few issues associated with classical contracts. The smart contracts eliminate the requirement of trusted third party and it will eliminate the service cost of the notary. The terms and conditions can convert into programmable codes and deployable publicly. Terms and conditions are transparent and guarantee that they have not been manipulated. Furthermore, smart contracts can take their decisions of their own. For instance, the imposing penalties can be defined if the terms and conditions breached. Smart contracts are an ideal solution to replace the classical contracts and improve efficiency, effectiveness and security.

Frantz and Nowostawski (2016) proposed a modeling approach that supports the semi-automated translation of human readable contract representations into computational equivalents to enable the codification of laws. The translated contracts are verifiable and enforceable computational structures reside within a public blockchain. The authors identified the smart contract components that correspond to real world institutions and explored capability based on selected examples. Scheid and Stiller (2018) explained the application of smart contracts to automate the service level agreement process by eliminating any third parties during negotiations with guaranteeing terms agreed upon the service level agreement will not change. Through the smart contract, the bureaucratic and manual compensation process is replaceable by the autonomous contractual process which on board any untrusted parties together, such as subscriber and service provider. The PoC presented in the smart contracts for compensation of service level agreement using network function virtualization.

3.5.3. Public services
eGovernment refers to electronic implementation of a broader spectrum of public services provided by the government to the citizens. eGovernment services include issuance of identification documents, taxation, insurance, utilities, border control and so on. To establish the trust, most of the eGovernment services developed adapting to a centralized architecture. For an instance, PKI is a vital component in most of the classical eGovernment service. PKI establish the root of trust as the root CA. The centralized eGovernment systems have all of the common issues associated with any centralized systems, including administrative overheads, the central point of failure, expensive perimeter security requirements and so on. The smart contracts will eliminate the major issues mentioned and will provide a decentralized highly available eGovernment system with extended transparency.

Walport (2016) discussed multiple eGovernment applications integrated with smart contracts. The author illustrated significant use cases such as strengthening international aid systems with smart contracts. The author also highlighted the capability of integration of blockchain technology for other services such as finance and taxation. Chiang et al. (2018) presented a blockchain and the smart contract integrated system to build the trust between immigrants and the government. The authors introduced ChainGov, a collaborative decentralized platform for immigrants, governments, and other institutions that can inform each collaborative individual about the flow of money as well as real time visibility of all transactions. They also indicate design implications and future directions of the work. Bodó et al. (2018) presented a normative analysis of blockchain technology contracts along with the smart contracts and their applicability to copyright law. The extensive features of blockchain technologies including trust and decentralization as well as transparency was highlighted for the compatibility of blockchain with the fundamentals of copyrights. The authors discussed that substantial amount of transactions in the copyright domain could be modeled as if-then rules and eventually into smart contracts. Gheorghe et al. (2017) presented the blockchain technology and its application for the governance of the music industry along with smart contracts and cryptocurrency. The authors highlighted the applicability of smart contracts for terms and conditions in music industry. In addition to that, the smart contract and its application for tracking the copyrights of digital content and its value discussed.

3.5.4. National democracy
Voting is an important event in any democratic nation which requires the participation of every civilian. The election and counting process are computerized in some countries. Still, there are technical hurdles in implementation of entirely electronic voting systems in some countries. The reliability is a primary requirement in the voting systems along with the on-demand auditing and compliance assessment requirement. Furthermore, the scalability is a key requirement with ensured service availability. The data privacy and access control are also mandatory features in the electronic voting systems. However, there are some limitations in the service values in existing centralized voting systems. The data access control in the centralized systems prone the into security risks. The alteration of the number of votes will raise serious political issues in the country. The scalability limitations may occur since the number of concurrent voters may increase upto few thousands in peak time. The blockchain based smart contracts provide an extensive value addition in the electronic voting systems by ensuring decentralization, transparency and eliminating a single point of failure.

Garg et al. (2019) presented an empirical review comparative analysis of the electronic voting systems based on blockchain. Ayed (2017) proposed a blockchain based electronic voting system which ensures authentication, anonymity, accuracy, and verifiability. The solution connected to a database of registered voters and the committed vote stored in the blockchain to ensure anonymity and privacy. McCorry et al. (2017) proposed Open Vote Network which ensures voter privacy using Ethereum for board room voting. The proposed system was tested on the public Ethereum network utilizing e-voting smart contracts. The voting operation incurs financial cost due to the blockchain network charge by the Ethereum public blockchain. Patidar and Jain (2019) proposed electronic voting system based on blockchain. The implementation was performed using Ethereum blockchain.

3.6. Internet of things
Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the hottest research areas in the recent ear of computer networking history. It is anticipated that billions of devices will be connected in future industries. Many new requirements are identified in different dimensions to facilitate these IoTs. The automation is an essential requirement with the IoT devices in future networks. Improvement of security is also challenging. The requirement of autonomous resource sharing will be a key feature of the next-generation autonomous systems. Blockchain based smart contracts will address many of these challenges in the future IoT systems with its in-built automated and decentralized nature. Smart contracts can be applied to fulfill many security requirements of IoT context. Fotiou and Polyzos (2018) illustrated the opportunities and challenges of the smart contracts for the Internet of Things. Fig. 6 illustrates the applications of the smart contracts in IoT context.

3.6.1. Smart contracts for scalable resource sharing of IoT
Resource sharing is a significant requirement in the IoT network. The resource restrictive infrastructure arises the necessity of optimal resource sharing service. The resource sharing service should not be a resource intensive process. If so, the resource sharing process will incur another overhead on the system. The cloud-based resource sharing mechanism will incur additional network traffic and computational cost. The smart contracts will enable peer to peer resource sharing which is optimal in computation-wise as well as in the network traffic. Thus, smart contracts can be the next-generation resource sharing approach in the IoT context.

Wright et al. (2018) introduced SmartEdge, Ethereum based smart contracts for the edge computing as a low-cost and low-overhead tool for compute-resource management. The smart contract consists with five different states for transition within its lifetime. The solution offloads the computation in verifiable manner. Özyılmaz and Yurdakul (2018) described a fault tolerant standardized IoT infrastructure with distributed storage service. The data access managed using the trustless blockchain. The authors used swarm as distributed data storage and Ethereum as the blockchain platform. Liu et al. (2019) proposed a blockchain-based framework for video streaming with mobile edge computing with adaptive block size for video streaming for mobile edge computing. The authors designed a customized incentive mechanism to facilitate the members including content creators, video transcoders and consumers. The details corresponding to the incentive mechanism encoded as a smart contract. Huang et al. (2017) proposed a decentralized blockchain based solution of trusted IoT data exchange. The authors developed a prototype which can record transactions in an auditable, transparent and immutable manner. The prototype developed using Ethereum blockchain.

3.6.2. Smart contracts in edge computing
Edge computing enriches the IoT systems in the restricted environment. The Edge nodes associated with IoT systems are capable of being offloaded with computationally expensive operations of IoT into themselves. In contrast with cloud computing, edge computing promises more resource economic operations. The centralized architecture of cloud computing generates more network traffic and contains latency. The blockchain and smart contracts which operate in a decentralized architecture fit into the Edge computing context for future IoT systems. The peer to peer connectivity eliminates extensive network traffic and latency. The throughput can be increased with the deployment of blockchain based smart contracts with Edge computing deployment model.

Xiong et al. (2018) introduced an economic approach empowered with a novel concept of edge computing for mobile blockchain. The authors pointed out that multiple access mobile edge computing is regarded as an auspicious solution to solve the proof-of-work puzzles for mobile users. The authors used Ethereum blockchain platform for the prototype system developed. Stanciu (2017) presented ongoing research on application of blockchain based smart contracts for the platform of hierarchical and distributed control systems adopted to IEC 61499 standard. The author used Hyperledger Fabric as the blockchain solution and the smart contracts were used to implement the function blocks. The system adopted microservices architecture with utilization of docker and kubernetes. Yang et al. (2018) proposed a data exchange prototype for smart toys, which empowered with modern edge computing technologies. The solution developed as a prototype of Hyperledger Fabric v1.0. The authors used the smart contract to ensure the data exchange mechanism is efficient, secure and reliable.

Samaniego and Deters (2019) presented a novel idea which proposed to encapsulate the features of blockchain, including smart contracts in software-defined components and distribute them towards edge devices. The smart contracts are deployed in deices called edge miners. The solution is ideal for the computational resource constrained environment. Xu et al. (2018b) proposed a blockchain based service provisioning mechanism for the protection of lightweight clients, such as the resource constrained IoT devices. The authors proposed to utilize the smart contracts to help the lightweight IoT clients to validate the acquired services and corresponding edge servers which will reduce the computational overheads for the IoT devices. The authors ensured high throughput and low latency by adopting efficient permissioned blockchain with the consensus engine which uses proof of authority. El Ioini and Pahl (2018) proposed a blockchain container based architecture which is aligned with W3C-Prov data model. The used Hyperledger Fabric as the blockchain platform. The significant activities such as the node joining, identity check and record provenance are implemented as smart contracts with the support of Hyperledger Composer.

3.6.3. Smart contracts for the enforcement of IoT security
Security is a crucial requirement in the IoT context. With the resource restricted hardware, it is extremely hard to enforce security by increasing the key sizes with multiple cryptographic operations. The devices are constrained in the form of computational power as well as memory. Hence utilization of public-key certificates will be an expensive operation to the IoT devices. The PKI systems may require verification through the requests sent to the cloud servers which will generate the network traffic. The access control and privilege definition on the centralized servers will be vulnerable. Overall, the blockchain enables the stakeholders to embed access control policy on the smart contracts and deploy in a decentralized manner. The code is immutable and free of being modified in contrast with the cloud computing environment. The decentralized operation ensures that no extensive network traffic will be generated when the security is being enforced.

The trust management of IoT ecosystem is vital security consideration. The mission critical application contexts such as healthcare, smart cities, and vehicular networks require high end trust establishment for the IoT nodes in operation. The trust management includes the different services such as the trust establishment, realtime trust assessment, trust withdrawal upon the malicious practices and so on. The future IoT infrastructure will connect billions of devices in realtime and the trust management frameworks expected to scale up aligning the massive connectivity requirement. The centralized trust management is challenging with the future demand expectations. In addition to that, the computational resource restrictions shift the highlevel IoT infrastructure design decisions towards decentralized architectures such as edge and fog computing based designs. The distinguishing features of the blockchain based smart contracts promise significant value additions to the classical trust architecture, addressing the limitations of classical trust ecosystems in IoT.

Fortino et al. (2020) initially proposed a method to measure trust of the automated guided vehicles in the smart factories and elaborated with a design of framework to exploit the measures for the formation of virtual, temporary and trust-based teams for the mobile intelligent devices. The included comprehensive experimental results which proves the efficiency and effectiveness optimization capability to improve the performance of the workshops. Fortino et al. (2019a) introduced a reputation capital model for the multi-agent systems and integrated blockchain technology to certify the reputation capital of each agent in each federated environment. The comprehensive experimental results prove the usability of the proposed model to detect the misleading agents. Fortino et al. (2019b) presented a reputation model with blockchain technology for grouping the agents in IoT. The reputation capital related operations, including the update of reputation capital managed through the smart contracts.

The authors outlined the security requirements for IoT as well as the existing threats, attacks along with the state-of-the-art solutions. The authors highlighted that the blockchain technology is a key enabler to solve many IoT security problems.

Lin et al. (2017) proposed a blockchain based conceptual architecture and design to establish trust of the private LoRaWAN network servers. The proposed solution provides an irrefutable mechanism which verifies that the data of a transaction existed at a specific time in the network. The authors also stated the capability of smart contract technology to define an automated trading model in the IoT network. Pan et al. (2019) designed and implemented a prototype named “EdgeChain”, which is an edge-IoT framework based on blockchain based smart contracts. The authors integrated a permissioned blockchain along with an internal currency system to link the edge cloud resource pool for each IoT device attached with account and resource usage. From the experiments and evaluation the authors highlighted that integrating EdgeChain is within the reasonable and acceptable range to gain the security benefits. Cha et al. (2017) proposed the blockchain connected gateways to the protection of users from sending personal data to IoT devices without the users' consent. The gateways proposed by them also store user privacy preference on IoT devices within the blockchain network. The solution contributed to improving privacy and trust in IoT applications with legacy IoT devices.

Salahuddin et al. (2018) proposed an agile softwarized infrastructure for IoT with secure and privacy preserving deployment in smart healthcare services with significant features such as enhanced security and virtualization techniques. The system employs smart contracts for seamless and transparent transfer of patient information from machine to machine. The authors have suggested that the integration of legal contracts as part of the deployed smart contracts can be used for proper enforcement and to control misbehaving members. Rantos et al. (2018) proposed a blockchain integrated framework named “Advocate” which facilitates the GDPR-compliant personal data on the IoT environment. The smart contracts have been utilized to define the rules and penalties as well as automatically enforce the obligations. As future work, the authors plan to develop a policy-based access control system for the integrated personal data management system in IoT. Pinno et al. (2017) presented a blockchain based architecture for IoT access authorization named as “ControlChain”. The authors stated that the architecture is user transparent, decentralized as well as scalable and fault tolerant. The authors divided the database of ControlChain into 4 different blockchains and illustrated clearly. The authors also provided a secure way to establish the relationship between users and devices. Liu et al. (2017) presented a blockchain-based data integrity service framework. The data integrity verification protocols were implemented as smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain operated in the private mode.

3.6.4. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)
The research and development of UAV evolved with a lot of strengths which are versatile and applicable in the future industries. UAVs can be utilized to complete tedious tasks that are risky and expensive to being fulfilled with humans. The operational accuracy is highly anticipated in UAVs intervention and efficient resource consumption is highly concerned. Especially the battery life is one the major concern in the UAVs. In addition to that, scalability is required in future UAV systems.

Air traffic management is the most important component of the aviation which incorporates a massive number of operations including flight directions, airport space allocation and so on. The air traffic management operations required to perfectly accurate since the lives on board of passenger aircraft are highly dependent on accurate air traffic management. Therefore, the privacy, availability, workflow compliance and realtime execution are the key requirements in the air traffic management context. The blockchain based smart contracts provide trust and accurate execution with its decentralized architecture. Therefore, the research organizations have a lot of anticipations on the applicability of blockchain based smart contracts for aviation.

Reisman (2019) presented an engineering prototype that includes a design and methodology to mitigate Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B) related security issues using blockchain based smart contracts. The design innovation is using an open-source blockchain platform which is operating in private mode to achieve the privacy and anonymity of the aircraft. The framework featured with a certificate authority and higher-band bandwidth communication channels for sharing private information between authorized parties such as aircraft and authorized members.

Eventually, the smart contracts consist of computer programs and algorithms. The matters related to the computer programs as well as classical software development life cycle are applicable to the smart contracts. The validation methodologies which are applicable to evaluate the computer programs and algorithms will be applicable to the smart contracts. In addition to that, there are some significant challenges identified which will leave gaps in the application functionality. These techniques will be focused in detail.

4.1. Verification and validation to resolve correctness issues
The deviated behavior from their functional specifications of smart contracts will be a significant problem in the smart contract applications. The formal verification of a computer program ascertains that the particular program is functioning according to the formal behavior for the defined inputs and proves the correctness. Formal verification exists with two level language principles. The formal verification can perform on the language level and on the bytecode level. From unit testing to application of complex mathematical functions, there is a myriad of techniques utilized in the context. The formal verification of the smart contract is salient with its operational properties. The smart contracts are immutable once they are deployed and cannot patch easily. In addition to that, the smart contracts may hold financial values in different applications and will be accessible for anyone. Therefore, formal verification is paramount in the context of smart contracts.

Bhargavan et al. (2016) outlined a framework to analyse and verify runtime safety and functional correctness of smart contracts written for Ethereum in Solidity programming language using F∗ functional programming language used in program verification. The tool verifies the smart contract in different perspectives including source level functional correctness, low-level properties such as gas consumption bounds and evaluation of the correctness of the output of Solidity compiler on a case-by-case basis applying relational reasoning. The authors assume that the verifier may only have the byte code in the verification. Bigi et al. (2015) presented an approach with game theory and combined models of the formal methods for addressing future challenges in decentralized smart contract systems. The authors applied game theory to analyse how the smart contracts are settled through bargaining procedures and formal methods for the protocol validation. The combined analysis formally and quantitatively clarifies the anticipated behavior of the protocol, which entrusted with a deposit scheme. Sergey et al. (2018) outlined the design of Scilla, which is an intermediate level language for smart contracts and provides a clear separation between smart contract communication and programming components with a computational model based on the communicating automata. Their future work consists of defining formal grammar and semantics of language and implementation of Scilla and verifying number of contracts on a real-world blockchain platform. Abdellatif and Brousmiche (2018) proposed a new formal modeling approach to verify the smart contract in its execution environment. The authors applied this formalism to concrete the smart contract for name registration implemented on Ethereum platform. The authors highlighted vulnerabilities to the smart contracts on the simulated executions and proposed alternative designs to eliminate the vulnerabilities. Nehai et al. (2018) proposed modeling method of Ethereum application based smart contracts which apply a formal method named as ModelChecking. The method verifies that the application implementation is compliant with its predefined specification which is formalized by a set of temporal logic propositions. The authors illustrated the approach by applying to a concrete case study from the energy market. Lahiri et al. (2018) present the evaluation of safety and security of smart contracts developed in Blockchain-as-a-Service offered by Microsoft via Azure Blockchain workbench. The semantic conformance of smart contracts formalized against a state machine model and developed an automated formal verifier for Solidity. The authors applied their verifier to VERISOL for the analysis of all contracts with Azure Blockchain Workbench.

4.2. Security vulnerabilities and prevention techniques
The security vulnerabilities expose the systems into different risks. Since the blockchain systems for the corresponding applications built on computer programs, the security flaws common to computer systems expected to investigate and eliminate for the secure functionality of systems. The re-deployment operations after the fixes of security vulnerabilities are different from traditional software deployment lifecycle and challenging with extensive overheads. Especially, when a particular application integrated with a public blockchain network, the rectification of a fault will be an expensive operation. However, there are different technologies emerged in parallel to the blockchain evolution in order to find the software vulnerabilities of smart contracts.

Atzei et al. (2017) analyzed the vulnerabilities of Ethereum platform, which is popular in the industry. The vulnerabilities grouped into three classes according to the level they are introduced, as Solidity, EVM bytecode, or blockchain. The authors highlighted that they expect the non-Turing complete, human readable languages will resolve some of the issues identified in future. Lin and Liao (2017) discussed the security issues encountered in blockchain and challenges needed to overcome. The significant security issues and challenges included majority attacks in consensus, forking issues as well as scalability issues. The authors also highlighted the role of government to define the corresponding laws for this novel technologies. Manjunath and Shah (2019) discussed the blockchain domain and focused on the possibilities of blockchain security analysis threat occurrences which is attracted more hackers' threats. The authors highlighted the significance of each issue and their impact. The authors expected that in future this will be resolved.

Parizi et al. (2018) provided a comprehensive empirical evaluation on the open source automatic security analysis tools utilized to detect the security vulnerabilities of the Ethereum smart contracts written on Solidity programming language. The authors tested the tools on ten real world smart contracts. The results conveyed that SmartCheck (Tikhomirov et al., 2018) is statistically more effective in automated security testing than other tools evaluated. Tikhomirov et al. (2018) proposed SmartCheck, a comprehensive analysis tool which detects the code issues of Ethereum smart contracts. The authors evaluated the tool on a massive dataset of real-world contracts and yielded potentially successful results. They also stated the capability of development of the tool in future directions including improvement of grammar.

Nikolić et al. (2018) implemented MAIAN, which employs inter-procedural symbolic analysis and concrete validator to identify real exploits. The tool identifies three main types bugs as suicidal contracts, which can kill by anyone, prodigal contracts, which can send Ether to anyone and greedy contracts which does not allow to get Ether to anyone. The tool evaluated with analysis of one million contracts and flags 34,200 contracts vulnerable spending 10 s per contract. Liu et al. (2018a) presented the tool ReGuard, which are useable to identify re-entrency bugs in smart contracts. It is a fuzzy-based analyzer which automatically detects the re-entrency bugs in Ethereum smart contracts. ReGuard iteratively generates random diverse transactions to test the vulnerability.

Jiang et al. (2018) presented ContractFuzzer which is a comprehensive fuzzing framework to detect 7 types of vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts. The authors identified few significant types of attacks s such as gasless send and reentrancy vulnerability. The authors identified the false negative rate optimized when comparing with other platforms. Luu et al. (2016a) proposed a symbolic execution tool named as Oyente to find potential security bugs. The tool flagged 8833 contracts as vulnerable out of the 19,366 including TheDAO bug which led to a 60 million USD loss. Liu et al. (2018b) proposed a semantic aware security auditing technique called S-gram which are applicable to Ethereum. The authors combined N-gram language modeling as well as lightweight static semantic labelling and to learn statistical regulatories of contract tokens and to capture high-level semantics such as the flow sensitivity of a transaction. The authors stated that S-gram is useable to predict potential vulnerabilities in identify irregular token sequences and possible to optimize existing in-depth analyzers. Brent et al. (2018) provided a security analysis framework for Ethereum smart contracts. It provides an analysis pipeline for the conversion of the low-level EVM bytecode into semantic logic relations. The evaluation conveyed that Vandal is fast and robust as well as outperforming leading state-of-art tools with successful analysis of 95 of all 141,000 unique contracts with an average runtime of 4.15 s. Suiche (2017) presented Porosity, which is a decompiler which generates readable Solidity syntaxes from EVM bytecode. The decompiled contracts can perform with static and dynamic analysis as required.

Grech et al. (2018) classified and identified the gas focused on vulnerabilities found in the Ethereum smart contracts. In addition to that, the authors presented MadMax, which are some static programming analysis techniques useable to detect gas related vulnerabilities with significantly high confidence. The approach included low-level analysis for decompilation in declarative program analysis techniques for higher level analysis which validated with 6.6 million contracts. Wüst and Gervais (2016) presented three vulnerabilities affecting Ethereum blockchain network and client. The authors described three vulnerabilities in consensus, block synchronization and block difficulty. The authors also suggested possible countermeasures to prevent the attacks discussed. Tsankov et al. (2018) presented Securify, which is a security analyzer for Ethereum smart contract. It is scalable, fully automated and capable of proving the contract behaviors are safe or unsafe corresponding to a given property and tested with more than 18k contracts. The analysis is a two stepped process which includes a symbolic analysis of contract's dependency graph to extract precise semantic information and checking for the compliance violation patterns. Grishchenko et al. (2018b) presented a complete small-step semantics of EVM bytecode and formalized a significantly large fragment of EVM using F∗, which is a popular programming language used for similar verification programmed proof assistant. The authors also successfully validated it against official Ethereum test suite. The authors further defined number of salient security properties for smart contracts. Otte et al. (2017) presented TrustChain, which is a permission-less and tamper proof data structure for the storage of transaction records. Trustchain included a novel Sybil-resistant algorithm named as NetFlow which can determine the trustworthiness of agents online. The Netflow algo agreed upon higher-level business logic. The framework significantly outperforms Oyente with zero false negatives in their data set. Grishchenko et al. (2018a) presented EtherTrust which is an automated static analysis tool of EVM bytecode. This supports scalability up to larger contracts. The authors tested the tool with Oyente and observed outperforming results and EtherTrust showed better precision on a benchmark rather than state-of-art solutions. Mossberg et al. (2019) introduced an open source dynamic execution framework named Manticore to analyse the binaries of Ethereum smart contracts. The framework provides analysis to find issues including logic bombs. The API provides flexibility to customize the utilization of framework. Mell et al. (2017)presented usage of cryptocurrency smart contracts to create a distributed consensus protocol which can produce a stream of trustworthy timestamped public random numbers. The main objective is to eliminate prediction and control attacks. With the smart contracts, no one can change the published values. Popejoy (2016) described Pact programming language which is developed for the Kadena blockchain platform. Kadena is a private blockchain platform that consists of the smart contract programming language in a human-readable form. The main feature is the Turing incompleteness which reduces the attack risk with restricted power of smart contracts.

4.3. Software bugs and software testing
The software testing is an essential practice in the software engineering. The quality of software codes and their position with the specification expected to be evaluated prior to the production integration. There are different techniques and tools in the market to identify software bugs and evaluate the quality. However, some research conducted to develop tools and techniques for the quality assurance of smart contracts specifically.

Liao et al. (2017) presented a behavior driven development framework for Ethereum smart contracts. The proposed work reduces the testing overheads and make the bug fixing process more convenient. Gao et al. (2019) presented SmartEmbed which can be used to identify the clone related bugs in solidity smart contracts. The proposed solution supports identification of bugs in the individual scale as well as large scale. Delmolino et al. (2016) documented some important insights from teaching smart contract programming to undergraduate students in the University of Maryland. The authors exposed common errors in designing safe and secure smart contracts. The authors highlighted the importance of fixing these errors in programming. Destefanis et al. (2018) presented a study case regarding a smart contract library named as Parity. The problem was due to poor programming practices and 500,000 Ether which is equal to 150M USD freezed in 2017. The authors analyzed the chronology of events and identified that the problem occurred due to negligent programming practices. Wang et al. (2019b) introduced a methodological approach to identify the non-deterministic payment bugs of the Ethereum smart contracts. The proposed solution implemented as NPCHECKER and tested with 30,000 smart contracts to detect the non-deterministic payment bugs. The tool further developed to detect the known vulnerabilities of Ethereum. Torres et al. (2018) proposed OSIRIS which is a framework that combines symbolic execution and tent analysis. The proposed solution evaluated with a significantly large smart contract dataset, which includes 42,108 Ethereum smart contracts to identify the integer bugs. Dingman et al. (2019) proposed a formal classification for the known bugs in smart contracts using NIST's bugs framework. The proposed framework introduced two classes as Distributed System Protocol (DSP) and Distributed System Resource Management (DRM).

4.4. Privacy issues and enhancement techniques
The data privacy is a vital concern in almost all applications. The core principles of blockchain include the public decentralized ledger which includes transaction data. However, these public transaction data may raise privacy issues in the perspective of data owners. These privacy requirements need to be addressed carefully without impact on the other features of blockchain, including performance requirements. The data privacy enforcement may reduce the gap between most of the present applications and blockchain for seamless integration.

Ibáñez et al. (2018) presented significant insights of different aspects blockchain technology including general data protection regulation and its applicability on blockchain as an enabler for data protection. The authors discussed application of permissioned and permissionless blockchain based smart contracts in association with appropriate data controllers. The authors categorized the two types of solutions in enabling compliance, as integration of different cryptographical functions and private computation schemes without revealing contents of transactions and application of blockchains as decentralized verification machines. Juels et al. (2016) illustrated the emergence of the criminal smart contracts which will facilitate to reveal the confidential information. The authors illustrated a few issues including theft of cryptographic keys by criminal smart contracts. Their results highlighted creating policies and technical safeguarding measures against criminal smart contracts to ensure the smart contracts' beneficial objectives.

Kosba et al. (2016) presents Hawk, a privacy preserving smart contracts, which dissipated the privacy hurdle encountered in Bitcoin and Ethereum as a currency. The authors propose a framework, which enables a non specialist programmer to write a privacy preserving smart contract. Hawk guarantees on-chain privacy, which cryptographically hides the flow of money and amount from public's view. Niya et al. (2018b) demonstrated a designing and implementation of a trading application which utilized Ethereum smart contracts. The application is developed with flexibility in requesting user identity directly by the seller and the buyer. The user privacy enhanced with other features such as time and cost. Chatzopoulos et al. (2018) proposed a new architecture for the event based spatial crowdsensing tasks in association with the blockchain and technology with user privacy preservation. The architecture utilizes smart contracts to allow crowdsensing service providers to submit their requests, run cost optimal auctions and handle payments. Liang et al. (2017) designed and implemented ProvChain, which is a decentralized architecture for trusted cloud data provenance. Provchain provides significant security features such as tamper-proof provenance and user privacy. The main operational phases are provenance data collection, provenance data storage and provenance data validation which provides tamper-proof records to enable transparency and data accountability in the cloud. Al-Bassam et al. (2017) presents ChainSpace, which offers privacy friendly extensibility in the smart contract platform. The platform offers higher scalability than the existing platform achieved through sharding across nodes using a novel distributed atomic commit protocol named as S-BAC. It supports auditability and transparency as well. Kalodner et al. (2018) presented Arbitrum, which is a cryptocurrency system with smart contracts. Arbitrum's model is compatible for private smart contracts which does not reveal the internal state to the verifiers who involve in the validation of transactions in certain circumstances. Arbitrum incentivizes the parties to agree off-chain on the VM's behavior which means that the Arbitrum miners only required to verify digital signatures without revealing the contract to confirm that parties agreed on VM's behavior.

Zhang et al. (2016) presented an authenticated data feed system which is named as Town Crier. Town Crier provides a bridge between smart contracts and existing websites which are commonly trusted for non-blockchain applications. The frontend and hardware backend combined with the solution which is enabled with privacy as required. Cheng et al. (2019) presented Ekiden, which combines blockchain with trusted execution environment. The authors leveraged a novel architecture which separates the consensus from execution and enabled confidentiality preserving smart contracts in trusted execution environment. The authors planned to extend their work to enable secure multi-party computation in future. Yuan et al. (2018) presented ShadowEth, which is a system that leverages a hardware enclave to ensure the confidentiality of smart contracts in public blockchain like Ethereum. The system also ensures integrity and availability. The authors implemented the prototype using Intel SGX on Ethereum network to analyse the security and vulnerability of the system.

Benhamouda et al. (2019) presented a method for making Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform compatible with private data using secure multi-party computation. The protocol implemented utilizing Yao's millionaire's problem and oblivious transfer. The authors associated a helper server, which separates multi-party computation into off-chain. Zyskind et al. (2015) presented Enigma which is a computational model based on a highly optimized version of secure multi-party computation named as Enigma which guarantees a verifiable secret-sharing schemes and ensure confidentiality. The authors used a modified distributed hashtable to hold secret-shared data with an external blockchain as the controller of the network to control the access and identity management. The private components of the smart contracts run off-chain on Enigma platform and named as private contracts.

4.5. Performance limitations and performance improvement techniques
The performance factors are essential considerations in the application perspective. The performance requirements of high volume transaction processing are mandatory for applications such as digital payment systems. The transaction verification times for the major blockchain platforms such as Ethereum and Bitcoin hindered the applicability to the retail payments. In contrast, the payment networks such as Visa provides 7000 transactions per second. However, a lot of research in progress to investigate techniques to enhance the performance features of blockchain.

Poon and Buterin (2017) proposed Plasma, which is a framework for incentivized and enforced the execution of smart contracts which is scalable upto billions of state updates per second. The authors proposed to multiparty off-chain channels to hold the transaction state on behalf of others. The smart contracts held in the root chain and the Plasma chain maintains the set of balances in the main chain. Forestier and Vodenicarevic (2018) proposed an architecture called blockclique, which shards the transactions in a block graph along multiple threads. A block in a selected thread only includes transactions assigned to this particular thread. The blockclique architecture reaches 10,000 transactions per second and provides protection against a wide range of well-known attacks.

Zamani et al. (2018) proposed RapidChain, which is a sharding-based public blockchain protocol with a complete sharding of communication, computation and storage overheads. RapidChain utilizes an optimal consensus algorithm with block pipelining and a novel gossiping protocol for large blocks. The empirical evaluations suggest that RapidChain can process 7300 transactions per second. Luu et al. (2016b) proposed Elastico, which is a distributed agreement protocol for permission-less blockchains which enables scalability. The solution automatically parallelizes the computational power for the mining service. The scalability evaluated by extending the number of nodes upto 1600 and focused on significant aspects corresponding to the scalability. Kokoris-Kogias et al. (2018) presented OmniLedger, which is a scalable distributed ledger with long term security in permission-less operations. OmniLedger is designed to enhance the scalability up to the Visa payment network being adopted with hybrid consensus and sharding techniques. The authors introduced “trust-but-verify” concept to increase the performance.

Fig. 8. Lessons learned and future work.

5.1. Financial applications
5.1.1. Lessons learned
Different applications of blockchain based smart contracts in the financial context was discussed previously. However, several aspects of blockchain based smart contracts are still required to be improved further. Governments and governing institutes still do not fully recommend smart contracts for the utilization of fund transfers. The lack of regulating capability in decentralized systems is the main reason for the government bodies reluctant to fully approve the smart contracts in the financial context. Escrow services also have the same decentralization features and still not adopted by the government bodies for International fund transfers. Eventhough the Bitcoin and Ethereum are not fully adopted by the government bodies for fund transfers, the smart contract platforms like Stellar is still working for the fund transfers beyond borders.

It is essential to reduce the transaction processing time if the blockchain is used for retail merchant payments. For instance, Bitcoin and Ethereum take a few minutes for the completion of transactions which is not preferred to experience in the quick merchant transactions. The transaction validation time has to be retained as minimal as possible eventhough the ledger is evolving with the transaction count. It is mandatory to integrate blockchain platform with mobile devices in order to adopt more users. For the merchant retail payment systems with smart contracts, it has to compete with Visa or MasterCard like centralized high-end payment processing systems. Therefore, the further optimization of transaction completion requires to be considered before integrating the smart contracts for financial transactions. However, the smart contracts will be ideal for the financial transaction enablement of closed-loop financial ecosystems such as rural and undeveloped regions.

The decentralized smart contract based KYC systems will be attracted by the future banks as a single customer data sharing platform. However, if the legal policies can be defined to regulate the customer data, the trust of the decentralized KYC systems will be elevated and more customer satisfaction can be anticipated. For the stock exchange, the smart contracts will be an ideal candidate since it enables the autonomous operation. The improvement of the transaction processing time is required for further adaptation.

For lending and borrowing, smart contract systems can play a vital role since lending and borrowing does not require a realtime operation. The autonomous settlement which can be enabled with the smart contracts will be value addition and eliminates fraud. The insurance also will be benefited by the smart contracts by executing the claims autonomously by data inputs and eliminating frauds. The transparency of the transaction records will be advantageous when the auditing procedure of the smart contract integrated systems is considered. The transparency can be a drawback also to the financial context since the transaction records are visible to the public and some customers can be discouraged to share the personal transaction details with the public. The traceability and autonomous execution will make the audit procedure independent and transparent. The main features of the smart contract systems are autonomous execution, elimination of third party intervention and transaction transparency in the financial context.

5.1.2. Future work
The future of financial transactions requires a robust intervention of the governing bodies to regulate the smart contract based financial transactions. Eventhough the decentralized nature preferred by the stakeholders, the government requires to monitor and establish rules and regulate to make the smart contract based financial transactions acceptable by the citizens. The improvements on the consensus anticipated when the smart contracts on board for the financial transactions. The transaction delays such as Bitcoin and Ethereum has required to eliminate if the smart contract based transactions are applying to retail merchant transactions. The computational resource consumption requires to optimize to eliminate the mining overheads in the financial transaction context. The future smart contract based financial systems required to design with formal auditing procedures and compliant with PCI-DSS(Payment Card Industry - Data Security Standards) and PA-DSS(Payment Application- Data Security Standards) standards for global acceptance. However, operating the smart contract based financial systems in a closed loop system such as a village, within an unbanked customer segment will help to identify the drawbacks in the real world operation. These drawbacks required to correct before the operation of smart contract based globally accepted payment systems.

5.2. Healthcare applications
5.2.1. Lessons learned
The different applications of smart contracts in the healthcare context discussed previously. The patient data protection and health information management have a lot of inspirations on smart contracts. The access control to the patient data can implement with the smart contracts with decentralization. Elimination of the central point of failure is beneficial for the mission-critical healthcare systems. Health-information management applications with the smart contract incorporation must comply with health data protection standards such as HIPAA. Privacy highly considered in health data management systems. In addition to that, the data integrity of protected data required to ensure utilizing smart contract systems.

The smart contract based data sharing mechanisms must ensure privacy and integrity for the data in transit. The accuracy of the operation of automated patient monitoring and treatment systems required to improve since the smart contract applied with life critical operations. The smart contract developed for healthcare systems must be checked for the bugs, vulnerabilities, and accuracy. The formal verification can utilize to verify the operational accuracy of smart contracts for the healthcare systems. The different aspects of the smart contracts must consider such as the stability of the operations on a load, memory usage on the execution of the contract and so on. The smart contract systems for the future healthcare systems mostly expected to operate on private mode rather than public blockchain operation. The data integrity and immutability of transaction data are the major expectations of smart contracts for the healthcare systems.

5.2.2. Future work
The future research of smart contracts focused on the improvement of privacy of health information management systems. The compliance with regulations is a major consideration of the incorporation of smart contract systems for healthcare. The privacy improvement along with the transparency requirement of blockchain based smart contracts is an important research direction. The secure data sharing schemes between third party organizations such as insurance companies required to improve the techniques such as oblivious transfer, secret sharing schemes. The next generation healthcare systems require synergetic operation with the services of smart city such as secured data sharing and eGovernment services. The data provenance respect to the sharing of private medical data is achievable with the immutable ledger. Since the accuracy of smart contracts developed for patient monitoring and treatment is highly anticipated, the applicability of formal verification was highlighted previously. The specialized formal verification methods for the healthcare systems are an important research area in the future.

5.3. Identity management and access control
5.3.1. Lessons learned
Identity management and access control contexts have numerous applications with smart contracts. The data currently stored in centralized systems that have many issues associated. Elimination of the centralization is the main advantage that attracts smart contracts for identity management. The users' capability to control the access of their own data improves trust. The hardware costs for centralized systems such as HSMs can eliminate through the decentralization. However, the incorporation of national identity management systems with smart contracts will require further amendments in the legal systems. The legal systems which recognize the digital signatures and electronic identification are not compatible with decentralized smart contract-based identity management and access control systems. Therefore, the regulatory bodies required to enrich with the operational capabilities, strengths and weaknesses of the smart contract-based access control system and define them legally. Then the smart contract based access control systems are extensible even internationally. The identity data protection solutions empowered with smart contracts require to ensure that they have aligned with local identity management standards. The security policy definitions with the smart contracts are the ideal use cases since through decentralization, the trust can establish. The consensus mechanisms and other dependencies required to be further improved for the efficient operation of identity management systems with smart contracts.

5.3.2. Future work
The Identity management system will be capable of automated identity management and access control in future. The synergetic operation with PKI based existing identity management systems will eliminate integration and adaptation hurdles. The decentralized identity management and access control systems must ensure the alignment with existing legal requirements in identity data protection. The data privacy must be guaranteed and it may be required to integrate with existing PKI systems which attached with HSMs. The smart contract based identity management systems are extensible as the national identity data repository of citizens. The access can be controlled by the users and the service providers such as banks, telecommunication services, and insurance can retrieve the data from the repository with the data owner's consent. The data usage records must transparently available in the ledger to ensure the data owner that his data was not transferred to third parties such as trade promoters and so on. The identity management systems must interface with the mobile devices which will enhance the usability of decentralized access control systems. The data access policy is a subject to define by the data owners. The consensus and storage systems must design with scalability provisions since the identity management systems will expand along with the number of users.

5.4. Real estate
5.4.1. Lessons learned
The main objectives of smart contracts in the real estate domain are to eliminate the trusted third party and reduce the transaction time. The centralized automated systems may currently in use and the smart contract-based real estate systems required to integrate with the existing legacy systems. However, the real estate information owned by the property owners must restrict in availability to the public. The property ownership transfer operations required to execute immediately but do not require to be realtime such as retail merchant transactions.
