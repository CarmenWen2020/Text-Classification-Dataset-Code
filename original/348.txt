In recent years, with the rapid development of communication networks, Vehicle to Network (V2N) arises at the historic moment. Particularly, due to the characteristics of fifth-Generation (5G) networks including low network latency and high data rate, vehicles can enjoy remote services in a real-time, high-quality and low-cost way. The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) have confirmed that remote diagnosis should be one of the development cores of Vehicle to everything (V2X). However, as vehicle safety is directly attached to the passengers’ safety, it is also a key point to ensure the security of remote diagnosis and maintenance services. In this paper, based on extended Chebyshev chaotic maps, we propose a robust authentication scheme for remote diagnosis and maintenance in 5G V2N. In the proposed scheme, to achieve strong security, anybody, such as the vehicle owner or the Vehicle Service Center (VSC) employee, must enter the valid biometrics and password before enjoying or providing remote diagnosis and maintenance services, and the vehicle and the VSC should authenticate each other to ensure that they are legitimate. Security analysis and performance analysis results show that the proposed scheme provides robust security with ideal efficiency.

1. Introduction
In recent decades, with the increasing demand for vehicle services, Vehicle to everything (V2X) has attracted wide attention because of its improvement in traffic efficiency, driving safety and user experience by utilizing network technology. Within V2X, Vehicle to Network (V2N) communication mainly focuses on intelligent control services such as line planning, remote control, dynamic map downloading, etc (Cao et al., 2020). With the emergence of fifth-Generation (5G) networks, vehicle remote services have drawn more and more attention due to extremely low network latency. Some international standards organizations such as the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) have confirmed that remote diagnosis should be one of the development cores of V2X (3rd Generation Partnership Project, 2015, European Telecommunications Standards Institute, 2009). In the traditional field of vehicle diagnosis and maintenance, whenever vehicle owners are unable to deal with the vehicle fault, the Vehicle Service Center (VSC) employees, like vehicle repair factory and 4S shop, need to provide help from a long distance, costing a lot of time and energy. While, through remote vehicle diagnosis and maintenance in 5G V2N, VSC employees belonging to a specific VSC can diagnose and maintain vehicles remotely. Because of the millisecond delay of 5G, there is little difference between remote operation and on-site operation, such as vehicle diagnosis, vehicle software/firmware maintenance, etc., which is a great solution for providing high-quality, globally available, low-cost and quick response services (Cao and Yan, 2010). However, as vehicle safety is directly attached to passengers’ safety, ensuring the security of remote diagnosis and maintenance services is very important. Several practical security requirements on vehicle remote diagnosis and maintenance services to be solved are as follows.

First, in order to prevent malicious users from operating vehicles illegally, both vehicles and VSCs should have the ability to authenticate the vehicle owner and the VSC employee, respectively. For example, only when the correct password and biometrics are entered/imprinted on the vehicle, can the remote diagnosis and maintenance request be initiated. Second, to ensure the legality of vehicles and VSCs, mutual authentication between the vehicle and the VSC is indispensable. Third, a session key between the vehicle and the VSC should also be generated in the authentication process to protect future communication data, such as vehicle diagnosis data. Fourth, to prevent users from privacy leaking and user tracking, identity anonymity and unlinkability should be achieved (3rd Generation Partnership Project, 2020). Finally, the Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) property should also be achieved to guarantee that the adversary who has got the long-term secret key cannot obtain the previous communication session. In summary, a robust authentication scheme for vehicle remote diagnosis and maintenance should be considered.

Recently, several remote diagnosis and maintenance schemes have been proposed in Cao and Yan, 2010, Weiss et al., 2006, Zhang et al., 2008, Jiang, 2011, Tian et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2010, Yan et al., 2010, Yang et al., 2013, Taie et al., 2012, Hu et al., 2015, Masoni et al., 2017. In these schemes, remote maintenance experts provide vehicle diagnosis and maintenance services via the Internet. However, these schemes only focus on the specific implementation of the system while the security issues are ignored. As far as we know, the 3GPP committee or other academic researchers have not defined an authentication scheme for vehicle remote diagnosis and maintenance yet.

Contributions. In this paper, benefiting from the existing schemes, we present a simple vehicle remote diagnosis and maintenance architecture in 5G V2N, which is formed by a Vehicle Networking Control Center (VNCC), numerous VSC and vehicle related parts. Based on this architecture, we propose a secure and efficient authentication scheme by the utilization of the extended Chebyshev chaotic maps. In the proposed scheme, VSC and vehicle related parts need to be registered in the VNCC and the VSC should inform the VNCC when they start to provide remote services. When the vehicle owner wants to enjoy the remote services, he/she inputs the valid identity, password and biometrics to send a service request message to the VNCC. Additionally, in some cases, for example in car rental services, it is not the vehicle owner but the vehicle driver who drives the vehicle. When the vehicle driver needs to access the remote services, the vehicle driver collaborates with the vehicle owner to send a service request message to the VNCC. Then, the VNCC searches database for solutions to vehicle faults or acts as a coordination center to find a suitable VSC for the vehicle and then assists the vehicle and the VSC to establish a secure channel. The VSC provides the corresponding diagnosis and maintenance services through the established secure channel. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows.

(1). In order to provide remote diagnosis and maintenance services for vehicles, we present a remote diagnosis and maintenance architecture in 5G V2N. In addition, we propose a secure and efficient authentication scheme based on this architecture. By this scheme, vehicle owners who enter/imprint the valid passwords and biometrics can access remote diagnosis and maintenance services.

(2). Considering that in some cases, it is not the vehicle owner who drives the vehicle, but the vehicle driver who does not possess the valid passwords and biometrics, we propose a collaborative authentication scheme to ensure that vehicle drivers can securely and efficiently access remote diagnosis and maintenance services.

(3). We discuss the security of the proposed scheme by using a random oracle model, formal verification tool named Tamarin and informal security analysis. Also, we evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme and other related schemes in terms of the computational and communication overheads. Security analysis and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme provides robust security with ideal efficiency.

Outline. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the related works. Section 3 introduces the preliminaries related to the proposed scheme. Section 4 shows the system model and adversary model. Section 5 specifies the proposed scheme. Section 6 and Section 7 discuss the security analysis and performance analysis. Finally, we draw a conclusion in Section 8.

Note that, this paper is an extended version of our previous conference paper (Ma et al., 2020). The main differences from the conference version are summarized as follows. First, the system model in this paper is a complete vehicle remote diagnosis and maintenance architecture in 5G V2N, which not only includes VNCC, VSC, vehicle maintenance control system and vehicle owner in conference paper, but also the vehicle driver and the user equipment of vehicle owner. Second, this paper extends the authentication process compared with the conference version, which only supports the vehicle owner authentication process. Our journal version not only adds the database-based authentication process, in which the VNCC searches the solutions to the vehicle fault in its database to quickly help vehicle owners to solve vehicle fault, but also the vehicle driver collaborative authentication process, in which the vehicle driver collaborates with the vehicle owner to perform mutual authentication process with the VSC with the assistance of the VNCC. Finally, this paper re-analyzes the security and performance of the proposed scheme by employing more security and performance analysis methods and comparing it with other newly added papers.

2. Related works
At present, there is no authentication scheme for vehicle remote diagnosis and maintenance, that is, there is no literature that has an explicit relation with the proposed scheme. According to the above analysis, the vehicle remote diagnosis and maintenance scheme is preferably based on password or biometrics, and the authentication entity has three parties. Thus, we mainly consider these existing password-based three-party authentication schemes in other similar scenarios including the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) scenario, the vehicular networks scenario and the others.

2.1. Related schemes for WSN
Several password-based three-party authentication and key agreement schemes among users, gateways and sensor nodes in WSN have been designed. In the early years, Das (2009) proposed a two-factor hash-based user authentication scheme. Unfortunately, this scheme has been proved unable to achieve mutual authentication between the user and the sensor node by Chen and Shih (2010). Later, to tackle this problem, Chen and Shih (2010) proposed an improved scheme. This scheme can successfully achieve mutual authentication between the user and the sensor node. However, this scheme is still vulnerable to replay attacks, forgery attacks and so on Xue et al. (2013). Xue et al. (2013) designed a robust authentication and key agreement scheme, which is efficient since only simple hash and XOR operations are used. However, this scheme still suffers from several loopholes, such as identity guessing attack, traceability attack, privileged insider attack and so on. He et al. (2015b) revealed that the scheme in Xue et al. (2013) is vulnerable to user impersonation attack, etc., and then designed an improved temporal-credential based efficient authentication scheme. However, it does not support PFS and still suffers from several loopholes, such as traceability attack, Ephemeral Secret Leakage (ESL) attack and so on. Later, Jiang et al. (2016) improved the scheme in He et al. (2015b) by using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithm. However, this scheme cannot realize PFS and lacks a password update mechanism. Wang et al. (2017) also revealed that the scheme in He et al. (2015b) is vulnerable to impersonation attack, smart card lost attack and tracking attack. Later, Wang et al. (2017) proposed an enhanced three-factor user authentication scheme by using ECC. However, this scheme is vulnerable to ESL attack. To fix the weakness in He et al., 2015b, Jiang et al., 2016, Li et al. (2018a) designed an improved scheme. This scheme can achieve these security properties including unlinkability and resistance against user impersonation attack and provide a password update mechanism. However, this scheme does not implement PFS. Additionally, in the authentication process of this scheme, any legitimate user can acknowledge the long-term secret key of the sensor node and any sensor node is able to obtain the long-term secret key of the user, which seems insecure. Amin et al. (2018) provided an untraceable and anonymous three-factor authentication scheme for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks and claimed that their scheme is efficient and can resist common protocol attacks. However, Aghili et al. (2018) have shown that this scheme cannot resist user impersonation, de-synchronization and traceability attacks. Later, Aghili et al. (2018) put forward a three-factor authentication scheme based on the pre-shared key, which is secure and efficient. Gope and Hwang (2016) proposed a lightweight anonymous authentication scheme for securing real-time application data access in WSN. However, this scheme does not ensure the privacy preserving of sensor nodes. Subsequently, Gope et al. (2019) introduced an improved lightweight and physically secure anonymous mutual authentication scheme. According to the Physical Unclonable Function (PUF), the user and the sensor accomplish mutual authentication with the assistance of the gateway. However, this scheme is unable to support PFS. Wu et al. (2021) introduced a novel three-factor authentication protocol for WSN. Unfortunately, this scheme suffers from ESL attack and does not support PFS. Li et al. (2018), Li et al. (2018b) and Srinivas et al. (2020b) proposed the authentication schemes for industrial IoT, which is similar to WSN, respectively. In these schemes, the mobile device and the sensor node employ the secret key pre-assigned by the gateway to accomplish mutual authentication with the gateway, respectively. These schemes can implement these security properties including mutual authentication, identity anonymity, unlinkability, etc. However, the XOR operation results on the user’s long-term secret key and identity and the server’s identity are sent in public in Li et al. (2018). Because the identities of users and servers are easy to obtain, this scheme dramatically increases the risk of long-term secret key leakage. Additionally, the scheme in Li et al. (2018b) cannot provide PFS and is vulnerable to the leakage of ephemeral parameters. Li et al. (2020) presented an ECC-based three-factor authentication scheme for wireless medical sensor network. This scheme can achieve mutual authentication and PFS. Unfortunately, this scheme suffers from ESL attack and consumes a lot of computational and communication overheads.

2.2. Related schemes for vehicular networks
Several password-based three-party authentication and key agreement schemes for vehicular networks have been designed. Mohit et al. (2017) proposed an authentication scheme in vehicular communications to ensure mutual authentication among users, sink nodes and vehicle sensors. However, Yu et al. (2018) have proved that this scheme does not support mutual authentication, key agreement and anonymity, and cannot resist these attacks including impersonation and traceability attacks. Further, Yu et al. (2018) put forward a secure authentication scheme. This scheme can successfully realize mutual authentication between the user and the sink node, and between the sink node and the vehicle sensor. However, any attacker who knows the identity of the vehicle sensor can forge as the user to communicate with the sink node, which seems insecure. Kumar et al. (2018) provided an authentication among vehicles, service providers and registered certificate authority. By the use of the certificate mechanism, the vehicle can accomplish mutual authentication with the service provider. Cui et al. (2020) presented an authentication scheme among vehicles, registered Trusted Authority (TA) and Cloud Service Providers (CSP) in vehicular networks. In this scheme, vehicles can enjoy the cloud service provided by the appropriate CSP, which is selected by the TA. However, the vehicle authenticates the CSP by checking its identity, which can be easily calculated from the public transmitted data. Thus, this scheme does not realize mutual authentication. In addition, this scheme consumes a lot of computational and communication overheads. Vasudev et al. (2020) proposed a lightweight mutual authentication among vehicles, registered TA and vehicle servers for vehicular networks. In this scheme, the mutual authentication between vehicles and TA can be realized based on the cloaked password, and the mutual authentication between TA and vehicle servers can be realized based on the pre-shared key. However, since the vehicle does not send any information about its identity, it is infeasible for the TA to distinguish the correct vehicle and then find the corresponding cloaked password. Therefore, mutual authentication cannot be successfully achieved. Additionally, this scheme suffers from replay attack. Jiang et al. (2020) put forward a cloud-centric three-factor authentication and key agreement scheme among users, registered cloud and autonomous vehicles. By this scheme, the user and the autonomous vehicle achieve mutual authentication with the assistance of the cloud. However, owing to the use of multiple point multiplication operations, this scheme consumes a lot of computational overheads. Ali et al. (2020) designed a lightweight authentication mechanism among user mobile devices, registered ground station server and remote drones for unmanned vehicles. By this scheme, mutual authentication between user and ground station server, and between remote drone and ground station server is claimed to be accomplished. However, the remote drone authenticates the ground station server by confirming identity information, which seems insecure. Jiang et al. (2021) proposed a three-factor authentication scheme among users, registered data center and vehicle sensors by using PUF. In this scheme, the user and the vehicle server realize mutual authentication and key agreement with the help of the registered data center. However, this scheme consumes a lot of computational overheads.

2.3. Related schemes for other scenarios
Lee et al. (2010) proposed a three-party remote user authentication scheme among users, trusted third party and service servers by using biometric data for emergency scenarios. By this scheme, the user completes mutual authentication with the service server with the assistance of the registered trusted third party. However, due to the use of multiple modular exponentiation operations, the scheme consumes a lot of computational and communication overheads. Kumar et al. (2012) proposed an efficient authentication scheme among users, gateways and sensors for health-care applications. Unfortunately, this scheme has been proven to be vulnerable to off-line password guessing attack and privileged insider attack and does not support anonymity (He et al., 2015a). Later, He et al. (2015a) put forward a robust anonymous authentication scheme among users, gateways and sensor nodes for health-care applications. This scheme is efficient due to lightweight cryptography operations. However, this scheme suffers from password change attack and traceability attack (Yu et al., 2018). Abbasinezhad-Mood and Nikooghadam (2018) presented a password authenticated key exchange scheme to read isolated smart meters by using the extended Chebyshev chaotic maps. By this scheme, the electricity service provider generates a required verifier for the reader to accomplish mutual authentication with the isolated smart meter. Srinivas et al. (2020a) designed a cloud centric authentication scheme for the wearable healthcare monitoring system. By this scheme, the user and the Cloud of Things Centric (CoTC), the CoTC and the wearable Sensor Node (SN), the SN and the user employ the stored temporary credentials to authenticate each other, respectively. However, the schemes in Abbasinezhad-Mood and Nikooghadam, 2018, Srinivas et al., 2020a are vulnerable to stolen smart card attack and the scheme in Srinivas et al. (2020a) does not implement PFS.

In summary, for these schemes in Li et al., 2018, Li et al., 2018a, Li et al., 2018b, Li et al., 2020, Srinivas et al., 2020a, Srinivas et al., 2020b, Mohit et al., 2017, Kumar et al., 2012, Kumar et al., 2018, Yu et al., 2018, Vasudev et al., 2020, Ali et al., 2020, Jiang et al., 2020, Jiang et al., 2021, Lee et al., 2010, He et al., 2015a, Amin et al., 2018, Aghili et al., 2018, Gope and Hwang, 2016, Gope et al., 2019, Wu et al., 2021, the user directly specifies the sensor node to be connected. However, in real remote diagnosis and maintenance scenario, the vehicle owner may not acknowledge the available VSC or the specified VSC may not work properly. Thus, only these schemes in Das, 2009, Chen and Shih, 2010, Xue et al., 2013, He et al., 2015b, Jiang et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2017, Abbasinezhad-Mood and Nikooghadam, 2018, Cui et al., 2020 may be suitable for the remote diagnosis and maintenance scenario. Since these schemes in He et al., 2015b, Jiang et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2017 are the improvement of the previous schemes in Das, 2009, Chen and Shih, 2010, Xue et al., 2013, we ignore these previous schemes and only consider the comparison with these schemes in He et al., 2015b, Jiang et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2017, Abbasinezhad-Mood and Nikooghadam, 2018, Cui et al., 2020. Additionally, all the schemes above only consider the unilateral authentication process that mobile devices authenticate users through biometrics or passwords, but in remote diagnosis and maintenance scenario, both the vehicle and the VSC need to authenticate the vehicle owner and the VSC employee, respectively. Therefore, it is of great necessity to design an authentication scheme for vehicle remote diagnosis and maintenance.

4. System model and adversary model
4.1. System model
Fig. 1 depicts the architecture of the remote diagnosis and maintenance services in 5G V2N. The architecture mainly consists of three parts: Vehicle Networking Control Center (VNCC), Vehicle Service Centers (VSCs) and vehicle related parts.

VNCC, deployed inside or outside 5G Core network (5GC), is mainly responsible for vehicle/VSC registration and management. The VNCC is equipped with a large database, used to store registration information of vehicles and VSCs as well as possible solutions for simple vehicle faults. Vehicles or VSCs are registered in the VNCC with their vehicle/service licenses. When remote diagnosis and maintenance services are requested by a vehicle, the VNCC looks for solutions of the corresponding vehicle faults in the database. If there is no solution, the VNCC would choose a suitable VSC for different types of vehicles and assists the vehicle and the corresponding VSC to build a secure channel.

VSC, including a VSC Server (VSC-S) and VSC Employees (VSC-E), connects to the VNCC through the wired network and represents a service provider that can provide remote diagnosis and maintenance services for vehicles, such as a vehicle repair factory, 4S shop, etc. Each legitimate VSC possesses a service license. In order to prevent malicious users from operating illegally instead of employees, VSC-E must enter valid identity and password and imprint biometrics on the sensor of the VSC-S to initiate the online notification message authenticated by the VNCC. After the VNCC successfully authenticates the VSC and assists to build a secure channel between the VSC and the vehicle, the VSC starts to provide remote diagnosis and maintenance services for the corresponding vehicle. Concretely, the VSC-E firstly diagnoses the vehicle, locates the vehicle fault and then judges whether it can be maintained by itself online. For example, the VSC-E may handle some vehicle software/firmware faults online, except hardware faults. If the VSC-E can deal with the faults, the VSC-E informs the faults information together with online maintenance recommendation to the vehicle owner. Then, the vehicle owner can choose to accept the recommendation or not. If the vehicle owner is willing to accept it, the VSC will maintain the vehicle through the established secure channel.

Vehicle related parts, mainly consist of Vehicle Maintenance Control System (VMCS), vehicle owner, the User Equipment (UE) of vehicle owner and vehicle driver.

(1) Vehicle owner refers to the vehicle’s legal owner, who enters the selected identity and password and imprints biometrics on the VMCS/UE when initializing the vehicle for the first time. A vehicle owner who requests to activate the remote diagnosis and maintenance services must input valid identity and password and imprint biometrics on the sensor of the VMCS/UE. Each vehicle owner has a vehicle license.

(2) VMCS installed on the vehicle and equipped with a wireless network card, connects to the VNCC in 5GC through the 5G New Radio (NR). VMCS is the vehicle maintenance control center, which can control and manage vehicle software, vehicle firmware, etc. After obtaining the vehicle owner’s valid identity, password and biometrics, the VMCS initiates the remote diagnosis and maintenance services by sending a service request message to the VNCC.

(3) Vehicle driver is not the legal owner but the legal temporary user of the vehicle. After being allowed to use the vehicle, the vehicle driver possesses the authorization information of the vehicle owner. A vehicle driver who wants to enjoy remote diagnosis and maintenance services would initiate a collaborative service request message to the UE of the vehicle owner through the VMCS.

(4) UE belonging to the vehicle owner, is equipped with a vehicle management application, which can manage the vehicle remotely. Once receiving a collaborative service request, the vehicle owner verifies the legitimacy of the vehicle driver and then inputs the valid identity and password and imprints biometrics on the sensor of the UE to initiate remote diagnosis and maintenance services by sending a collaborative service response message to the VNCC.

4.2. Adversary model
In this paper, the widely-used Dolev–Yao (DY) model in Dolev and Yao (1983) is adopted as the basic adversary model to analyze the security of the proposed scheme. In the DY model, the adversary  has the ability to control the whole network. Concretely, the adversary can eavesdrop, intercept, store, modify, delete or even forge the messages through the insecure channel.

Additionally, considering the specific characteristics of the remote diagnosis and maintenance architecture, the adversary has the following abilities. Firstly, since the vehicle or the VSC-S can be physically obtained by other registered users, the registered user may impersonate as a designated user to initiate the VMCS/VSC-S. Secondly, since the vehicle/VSC-S/UE may be lost or stolen, the adversary may obtain the secret parameters stored in the VMCS/VSC-S/UE by complex power analysis attacks. Thirdly, since the session data between the vehicle and the VSC-S is related to vehicle safety, attached to the passengers’ safety, it is of vital importance to ensure the session data transmission security. Therefore, we consider the following two aspects. On the one hand, the adversary may obtain ephemeral secret values generated in the authentication process (like the eCK-adversary model in LaMacchia et al. (2007)). On the other hand, the adversary may obtain the long-term private key of VMCS or VSC-S. Thus, to ensure the session data transmission security, it is necessary to ensure the security of the session keys between the VMCS and the VSC-S even if the long-term private keys or the ephemeral secret values are compromised. Finally, it is assumed that the VNCC in 5G V2N remote diagnosis and maintenance architecture can be placed under a secure system to protect physical capture from the adversary. Therefore, the VNCC is considered a trusted participant.

5. The proposed scheme
In this section, we first give an overview of the proposed scheme. Subsequently, we specify our proposed scheme, which includes the following six phases: system setup phase, registration phase, online/offline notification phase, authentication phase, collaborative authentication phase, and password/biometrics update phase.

5.1. Overview
After the system setup process is completed, the following five phases including registration phase, online/offline notification phase, authentication phase, collaborative authentication phase and password/biometrics update phase are performed in sequence. First, to enjoy/provide the remote diagnosis and maintenance services, the UE, the VMCS and the VSC-S need to register with the VNCC, respectively. Second, as VSC-Es cannot work all the time, each VSC needs to inform the VNCC when it starts/terminates providing remote diagnosis and maintenance services. Third, when remote diagnosis and maintenance services are required, the vehicle owner performs the authentication phase. Fourth, considering that in some scenarios, it is the vehicle driver instead of the vehicle owner who drives the vehicle and needs the remote diagnosis and maintenance services, so the vehicle driver is supposed to collaborate with the vehicle owner to perform the collaborative authentication phase. Finally, to ensure security, passwords or biometrics need to be updated. Note that, if the VMCS, UE or VSC-S is damaged/stolen/lost, the vehicle owner or the VSC-S just registers with the VNCC again and the VNCC updates the database.

5.2. System setup phase
In system setup phase, the VNCC firstly selects a big prime number  and a random number  as the basic parameter of the extended Chebyshev chaotic map. Subsequently, the VNCC picks a random number 
 as its private key and computes its public key 
. Then, the VNCC chooses two secure one-way hash functions  and  and one keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC) function 
, where  and  are the output length of the hash function and the HMAC function, respectively. Finally, the VNCC publishes these parameters 
. The notations required in this paper are listed in Table 1.

5.3. Registration phase
In registration phase, after obtaining the identity, password and biometrics for the first time, the UE, the VMCS or the VSC-S registers itself by securely providing its license to the VNCC, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, the registration phase mainly contains the following three processes for different entities.

Step 1. The vehicle owner chooses an identity 
 and a password 
 and imprints biometrics 
 on the sensor of the UE.

Step 2. The UE picks a random number 
 as its private key and computes 
, 
, 
 
, where 
 includes the 
 and the vehicle license. Finally, the UE sends a registration request message including 
 to the VNCC.

Step 3. Upon receiving the registration request message, the VNCC computes 
, 
. The VNCC parses out 
 and vehicle license from the 
. If the vehicle license is valid, the VNCC stores 
 in its database. Finally, the VNCC sends a registration success message to the UE.

Step 4. The UE randomly selects a number 
 and computes 
, 
, 
, 
, 
. Finally, the UE stores 
.

2. Registration phase of VMCS

Step 1. The vehicle owner inputs the selected identity 
 and password 
 and imprints his/her biometrics 
 on the sensor of the VMCS.

Step 2. The VMCS picks a random number 
 and computes 
, 
, 
, where 
 includes the 
 and the vehicle license. Finally, the VMCS transmits a registration request message including 
 to the VNCC.

Step 3. Upon receiving the registration request message, the VNCC computes 
, 
 and parses out 
 and vehicle license from the 
. Subsequently, the VNCC validates the vehicle license and searches the database for the same vehicle license. If the vehicle license is already stored in 
, the VNCC computes 
, adds 
 to the end of the 
 and sends a registration success message containing 
 to the VMCS.

Step 4. The VMCS randomly selects a number 
 and computes 
, 
, 
, 
, 
. Finally, the VMCS stores 
.

3. Registration phase of VSC-S

Step 1. The VSC-E inputs the selected identity 
 and password 
 and imprints his/her biometrics 
 on the sensor of the VSC-S.

Step 2. The VSC-S picks a random number 
 and then calculates 
, 
, 
, where 
 contains the 
 and the service license of the VSC. Finally, the VSC-E registers itself by providing a registration request message containing 
 to the VNCC.

Step 3. Upon receiving the registration request message, the VNCC computes 
, 
 and parses out 
 and service license of the VSC from the 
. If the service license is valid, the VNCC stores 
 in its database. Finally, the VNCC sends a registration success message to the VSC-S.

Step 4. Once receiving the registration success message, the VSC-S randomly selects a number 
 and computes 
, 
, 
, 
, 
. Finally, the VSC-S stores 
.

5.4. Online/offline notification phase
In online notification phase, as shown in Fig. 3, each VSC-E inputs valid identity, password and biometrics into the VSC-S and then the VSC-S generates an online notification message to the VNCC. The details are as follows.

Step 1. The legitimate VSC-E inputs his/her identity 
 and password 
 and imprints biometrics 
 on the sensor of the VSC-S. The VSC-S computes 
, 
, 
 and verifies 
. If the verification is successful, the VSC-S computes 
 
. Subsequently, the VSC-S generates a random number 
  
 and computes 
, 
, 
, 
, where 
 represents the privacy information of the VSC-S, such as the identity 
 and the type of vehicle that the VSC can repair, and 
 denotes the current timestamp. Finally, the VSC-S sends an online notification message including 
 to the VNCC.

Step 2. The VNCC checks the validity of the 
, computes 
, 
, parses out the identity 
 from the 
 and searches the 
. Subsequently, the VNCC employs the 
 to authenticate the VSC-S by the equation 
. If the verification succeeds, the VNCC temporarily stores 
.

In the offline notification phase, the VSC who intends to stop providing services shall send an offline notification message to the VNCC. Upon receiving the offline notification message, the VNCC deletes 
.

5.5. Authentication phase
In authentication phase, as shown in Fig. 4, when the remote diagnosis and maintenance services are required, the vehicle owner enters the valid identity and password and imprints biometrics on the VMCS to initiate the service request. The VNCC verifies the service request message and searches its database for solutions to vehicle faults. If the solution is found, the VNCC directly informs the VMCS to use this solution to quickly deal with the vehicle fault, which is called as database-based authentication process. Otherwise, the VNCC selects a suitable VSC for the vehicle to solve the vehicle fault professionally and assists the vehicle and the VSC to complete the mutual authentication, which is called as VSC-based authentication process. The details are as follows.

Step 1. The vehicle owner inputs his/her identity 
 and password 
 and imprints biometrics 
 on the sensor of the VMCS. The VMCS computes 
, 
, 
 and verifies 
. If the verification is successful, the VMCS calculates 
. Subsequently, the VMCS selects a random number 
 and computes 
, 
, 
, 
, where 
 indicates the privacy information of the VMCS, including the identity 
, the vehicle type, a simple fault description and the type of the VSC (optional) and 
 denotes the current timestamp. Finally, the VMCS transmits a service request message including 
 to the VNCC.

Step 2. Upon receiving the service request message, the VNCC checks 
, computes 
 and works out the privacy information 
. Subsequently, the VNCC searches the 
 based on the identity 
 and verifies the VMCS by the equation 
. If the verification succeeds, the VNCC searches the database for possible solutions to the simple fault description included in the 
 and executes the following processes according to the different search results.

Database-based authentication: If a solution 
 is found, the procedure jumps to Step 3.

VSC-based authentication: If no solution is found, the procedure jumps to Step 4.

Step 3.

3a
The VNCC encrypts 
 by the equation 
, computes 
 and transmits the ciphertext 
 together with the 
 to the UE directly.

3b
Upon receiving 
 and 
 from the VNCC, the VMCS obtains the solution 
 and verifies 
. If the verification succeeds, the VMCS attempts to use the solution to solve the vehicle fault. If the fault is solved, the VMCS computes 
. Otherwise, the VMCS calculates 
. Finally, the VMCS transmits 
 to the VNCC.

3c
Upon receiving the 
 from the VMCS, the VNCC checks 
. If 
, the remote diagnosis and maintenance services complete successfully. Otherwise, the procedure jumps to Step 4.

Step 4.

4a.
The VNCC selects a suitable VSC for the vehicle according to the vehicle type and the stored information of VSC-Ss 
. Then, the VNCC computes a temporary license key for the VSC by the equation 
. The VNCC calculates 
 and hides the 
 and 
 by the equation 
, where 
 denotes the necessary information of the vehicle including the vehicle type and the fault description and 
 is the current timestamp. Finally, the VNCC transmits a service notification message including 
 to the VSC-S.

4b.
Upon receiving the service notification message, the VSC-S checks the timestamp 
, computes 
 and verifies 
. If the verification succeeds, the VSC-S makes a preliminary evaluation of the vehicle fault according to 
. If the VSC-S thinks that the vehicle fault may be solved online, the VSC-S computes 
, 
, 
, where 
 contains the necessary information of the VSC, such as the 
 and a brief introduction to serviceable information. Finally, the VSC-S transmits an authentication service response message including 
 to the VMCS directly.

4c.
Upon receiving the authentication service response message, the VMCS computes 
, 
, 
 and verifies 
. If the verification succeeds, the VMCS computes the session key to be used with the VSC-S as 
. Finally, the VMCS computes 
 
 and sends an authentication service confirm message including 
 to the VSC-S.

4d.
Upon receiving the authentication service confirm message, the VSC-S calculates the session key 
 and verifies 
. If the verification succeeds, a secure channel is established successfully between the VMCS and the VSC-S. Finally, the VSC begins to provide the corresponding diagnosis and maintenance services through the secure channel.

In the process of providing remote diagnosis and maintenance services, the VSC-E diagnoses the vehicle, locates the vehicle fault and then judges in detail whether it can be maintained by itself online. If can, the VSC-E informs the fault together with online maintenance recommendation to the vehicle owner. Then, the vehicle owner can choose to accept the recommendation or not. If the vehicle owner is willing to accept it, the VSC would maintain the vehicle.

5.6. Collaborative authentication phase
In collaborative authentication phase, as shown in Fig. 5, the vehicle driver starts the collaborative service and then the VMCS sends a collaborative service request to the corresponding UE of the vehicle owner. Subsequently, the vehicle owner chooses whether to authorize the vehicle driver to enjoy remote diagnosis and maintenance services. The details are as follows.

Step 1. The vehicle driver should get the vehicle owner’s authorization information 
 offline and click the collaborative service request button on the VMCS. The VMCS generates a random number 
 and computes 
, 
, 
, 
, 
, 
. Finally, the VMCS encrypts 
 with 
 and sends the encrypted results together with the 
, 
 and the timestamp 
 to the designated UE.

Step 2. The UE checks 
 and then sends a collaborative service notification message to the vehicle owner. The vehicle owner chooses whether to authorize the driver to use the remote diagnosis and maintenance services according to the 
. If authorizing the vehicle driver, the vehicle owner inputs the identity and password and imprints biometrics on the UE.

Step 3. The UE computes 
, 
, 
 and verifies 
. If the verification is successful, the UE calculates 
. Subsequently, the UE works out 
 and decrypts the ciphertext with 
. Then, the UE verifies 
. If the verification succeeds, the UE computes 
, where 
 is the current timestamp. Finally, the UE directly sends a collaborative service response message including 
 to the VNCC.

Step 4. Upon receiving the collaborative service response message, the VNCC checks the timestamp 
 and computes 
 and 
. Then, the VNCC parses out the VMCS’s identity 
 from the 
 and searches the corresponding key 
 of the UE to which the VMCS belongs in its database. Subsequently, the VNCC verifies the VMCS by the equation 
. If the verification succeeds, the VMCS continues the same authentication process as Section 5.5.

5.7. Password/biometrics update phase
Before performing the password update phase, the VSC-S/VMCS/UE must verify the authenticity of the VSC-E/vehicle owner. As shown in Fig. 6, the password/biometrics update phase is described below. Note that, since VSC-Es may change frequently, on the VSC-S side, we consider the password and biometrics update phase, while on the UE and VMCS side, we only consider the password update phase.

1. Password update phase of UE

Step 1. The vehicle owner inputs his/her identity 
, old password 
 and imprints biometrics 
 on the UE.

Step 2. The UE computes 
, 
, 
 and verifies 
. If the verification is successful, the UE informs the vehicle owner to input a new password.

Step 3. The vehicle owner inputs new password 
.

Step 4. The UE calculates 
. Subsequently, the UE selects a random number 
 and computes 
, 
, 
, 
. Finally, the UE stores 
.

Step 1. The vehicle owner inputs his/her identity 
, old password 
 and imprints biometrics 
 on the sensor of the VMCS.

Step 2. The VMCS computes 
, 
, 
 and verifies 
. If the verification is successful, the VMCS notifies the vehicle owner to input a new password.

Step 3. The vehicle owner inputs new password 
.

Step 4. The VMCS calculates 
. Subsequently, the VMCS selects a random number 
 and computes 
, 
, 
, 
. Finally, the VMCS stores 
.

3. Password/Biometrics update phase of VSC-S

Step 1. The VSC-E inputs his/her identity 
, old password 
 and imprints old biometrics 
 on the sensor of the VSC-S.

Step 2. The VSC-S computes 
, 
, 
 and verifies 
. If the verification is successful, the VSC-S notifies the VSC-E to input the new password and biometrics.

Step 3. The new/original VSC-E enters new password 
 and imprints new biometrics 
. Note that, if only the original VSC-E’s password needs to be updated, just the new password needs to be provided while the biometrics remain unchanged.

Step 4. The VSC-S calculates 
. Subsequently, the VSC-S selects a random number 
 and computes 
, 
, 
, 
, 
. Finally, the VSC-S stores 
.

6. Security analysis
In this section, we analyze the security of the proposed scheme including online notification process, database-based authentication process, VSC-based authentication process and collaborative authentication process. We firstly employ the random oracle model to demonstrate the security of the proposed scheme. Here, for the sake of simplification, we take the VSC-based authentication process as an example, and the proof of other processes by using the random oracle model is similar to that of the VSC-based authentication process. Furthermore, we prove the security of all the proposed processes by using the formal verification tool and the informal security analysis.

6.1. Random oracle model
In this section, we demonstrate the security of the VSC-based authentication process in the proposed scheme by introducing a random oracle model. The random oracle model is mainly established under the Bellare Pointcheval Rogaway (BPR) model in Bellare et al. (2000), but some changes have been made in the  query to make it more suitable for the proposed scenarios based on smart card, password and biometrics. The details are as follows.

In our model, there are three types of participants, ,  and , which represent the VMCS, the VSC-S and the VNCC in the proposed scheme, respectively. The following attributes are considered in the random oracle model.

Participants: Let 
 be the instances 
, 
 and 
 of , , , respectively.

Accepted State: Upon receiving the final protocol message, it will return to the accepted state. The orderly connection of all communication messages it sends and receives is identified as the identity of the current session.

Matching Session: 
 and 
 are matching session only if the following conditions are satisfied: (1) They reach the accepted state; (2) They authenticate each other and share the same session key.

Freshness: We call a session fresh if the following conditions are satisfied. (1) The session has reached the accepted state; (2) The session key is not disclosed by using the  query; (3) These two types of  queries cannot be performed on the same .

Adversary: The adversary  can intercept, intrude, modify, delete the transmitted messages during the communication process. The details are as follows.

•
: The query models  eavesdrops the messages communicated among 
 and 
.

•
: The query models  transmits a modified or fabricated message  to 
 and receives a response from 
.

•
: The session key between 
 and its matching session may be exposed to .

•
: The password, biometrics or smart card parameters of  may be returned based on different values of . Concretely, if , return the password 
 and biometrics 
. Otherwise, return the secret information stored in .

•
: This query could be asked by  at most once. Upon receiving the  query, if 
 is not fresh, return . Otherwise, randomly pick a coin , return the session key 
 when  and return a random number of the same length as 
 when .

Random oracle: All the communicating entities including  have access to the hash functions  and  and HMAC function 
, which are further modeled as random oracles.

Semantic-security: Semantic-security is defined in several games between a simulator  and an adversary . After performing several polynomial queries,  needs to output the guessed value 
 of the selected test session. Let  represent the proposed scheme, 
 denote the advantage that  can successfully guess the  and thus, 
. If 
 is negligible, the scheme is called semantic-security.

Theorem 1

After performing at most 
  queries, 
 random oracle queries, 
  queries in time ,  has the following advantage to break the proposed scheme, 
 
 
 
 
ɛ
 
 where  is the size of the password dictionary, 
 is the size of the biometrics string 
, ɛ
 is the probability of false positive in biometrics, and 
 denotes the probability of  breaking the CMDH problem in time 
.

Proof

The security of the proposed scheme is proved by several games between a simulator  and an adversary .  firstly initializes the system. Subsequently,  runs the simulation scheme and answers the queries from . In the following proof, let 
 represent a series of games and 
 denote an event that the adversary can successfully guess the bit  in the game 
. These related games are given below.

Game 
: This game indicates a real attack. Thus, we have 

Game 
: In this game,  simulates the proposed scheme in random oracle models. These functions ,  and 
 are modeled as random oracles and  maintains several lists. 
 and 
 save queries and answers to random oracles ,  and 
, respectively. 
 and 
 save corresponding queries and answers that are directly asked by . Additionally, 
 stores the interactive messages generated by . Since 
 and 
 are perfectly indistinguishable, we have 

Game 
: In this game, we abort the game if a collision occurs. The collision may occur on hash random oracles or between protocol instances. For two instances of collision, in order to win the game,  can execute  query on one instance, and then perform  query on another instance to easily with the game. Thus, random oracle collision is mainly to prevent  from discovering and then using the collision to win the game. Therefore, we mainly consider these collisions in 
. Additionally, in the proposed scheme, these exchanged messages 
, 
, 
, 
 
 are dynamic with the use of the random number 
. According to the birthday paradox, the probability of collisions in the output of the hash oracle and random number is at most 
 and 
, respectively, where  denotes the size of the random oracle output or the random number (Bresson et al., 2003). Note that, 
 and the output values of HMAC 
 and hash / belong to 
 and 
, respectively. The two games 
 and 
 are indistinguishable unless the collisions make the game abort, so 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Game 
: In this game, we abort the game if  luckily guesses these authentication values 
, 
, 
 without performing the corresponding random oracle queries. For example, if  performs the 
 query,  first checks whether the message 
 is valid. If it is valid and the message 
 is neither generated by , that is 
, nor by  from random oracle query, the game is terminated. This game ensures that all received authentication values are either from  or from  that has asked the corresponding oracle query. Since 
 and 
, the probabilities of luckily guessing the values of 
, 
 and 
 are 
, 
 and 
, respectively. The two games 
 and 
 are not distinguishable unless  luckily guesses these correct authentication values, so 
 
 
 
 
 

Game 
: In this game, we abort the game if  successfully forges as a legitimate VMCS. Concretely, if  performs the 
 query,  first checks whether the message 
 is valid. If it is valid and 
, the game is terminated. Since the previous game 
 ensures that all received authentication values are either from  or from  (obtained by random oracle query), this game can guarantee that all received authentication values are from . Let us discuss the probability of  successfully forging as a legitimate VMCS.

Since the protocol is under the random oracle model, to forge as a legitimate VMCS,  needs to obtain the value 
 from the following two aspects.

On one hand,  performs the  query to obtain the biometrics and password of  and guesses the necessary information 
 stored in the VMCS. Then,  uses 
 to compute the possible 
 and perform the 
 query. If the query is valid,  can pick this session as the test session and easily obtain the session key to win the game. However, since the probability of guessing the value of 
, 
 and 
 simultaneously is negligible, we ignore this case.

On the other hand,  runs  query to obtain the secret information 
 stored in . Subsequently,  selects a password in the password dictionary and guesses the biometrics string 
 or just makes trials for the false positive. Then,  uses the password and biometrics to make a random oracle query to obtain 
. If  can successfully guess the password and biometrics, that is 
,  calculates the key 
 and impersonates as a legitimate . Concretely,  picks a random number 
, initiates a session as the test session directly and makes a random oracle query to obtain 
 to win the game. The probability of  successfully guessing the valid biometrics and password is 
ɛ
 (Li et al., 2018) and , respectively, so the probability of this case is 
ɛ
.

In summary, the two games 
 and 
 are not distinguishable unless  successfully forges as a legitimate VMCS, so 
 
ɛ
 

Game 
: In this game,  computes the shared key 
 and the session key 
 by using the private random oracles 
, instead of using the oracles , that is 
 and 
. In this way, the values 
 and 
 are completely independent from , 
 and 
. Because the protocol runs under the random oracle model, all hash oracle queries are answered in a random way, that is, the output of random oracle value is independent and random. Therefore, if  correctly distinguishes the game 
 and 
 with non negligible probability,  must have calculated the session key 
. Since 
 and 
,  must have asked the oracle query  on 
, which we call event 
. The games 
 and 
 are indistinguishable unless the event 
 occurs, so 

As is known to all, the event 
 is impossible to occur and 
 is a private random oracle that cannot be obtained by , so the session key is completely random to . Thus, we have 
 

Game 
: In this game,  embeds a CMDH into all sessions. Concretely, the values  and  are used to replace the value  in the VMCS and the VSC-S, respectively, that is 
 and 
.  needs to record 
 and 
 in its local database. Obviously, without knowing 
, 
 and 
, as well as 
 and 
 are indistinguishable to . Since the output of random oracles is independent and random, if  successfully wins the game with non negligible probability,  must have asked the oracle query  on 
, which we call event 
. Obviously, 

By picking randomly in the 
,  can obtain the triple 
 with probability 
. Then,  searches its local database to find the values 
 and 
 such that 
 and 
. Note that, 
, so  can use  to solve the CMDH problem. We assume that the probability of  breaking the CMDH problem in time 
 is 
. Thus, 

The above results further yield 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ɛ
 
 
 
 
 
ɛ
 

Based on the above analysis, the advantage of breaking the proposed scheme for  is negligible, that is, the proposed scheme is secure under this model.

6.2. Formal verification tool: Tamarin
In this section, we employ the formal verification tool named Tamarin to demonstrate the security of the proposed scheme. We choose Tamarin because it is a state-of-the-art protocol verification tool that can establish unbounded verification, mutable global state, induction, and loops (Basin et al., 2018) and can perfectly support these cryptographic operations including Diffie–Hellman (DH) exponentiation and XOR operations. Since CMDHP is similar to the DH problem in finite-field cryptography, in our model, the tamarin builtin  is employed to denote the Chebyshev polynomial operation. In Tamarin model, the default DY adversary model is adopted to analyze the security of the proposed scheme.

In Tamarin framework, the protocols are modeled by rewriting rules and the desired security properties are modeled by lemmas. If a lemma is achieved, the final result of this lemma in Tamarin model will be . Otherwise, the final result will be . The lemmas with the keyword  are used to model secrecy and authentication properties for all traces of the protocols. We define these lemmas according to the examples in Basin et al. (2016). Concretely, the lemma  specifies the confidentiality of the corresponding message. The lemma  says that the adversary cannot learn the session key unless he/she performed a long-term key reveal before. The lemma  specifies the process that  authenticates . The lemma   specifies the process that  authenticates  and at the same time,  negotiates a key with . The lemmas with the keyword  mean that there exists at least one trace on which the formula holds, which can be used to prevent a situation where all other lemmas with the keyword  show , but the model is not executable.

Fig. 7 shows the Tamarin execution result of the proposed online notification process. From Fig. 7,  authenticates  and the confidentiality of the privacy message 
 is achieved.

Fig. 9 shows the Tamarin execution result of the VSC-based authentication process. From Fig. 9,  authenticates ,  authenticates ,  authenticates  and  authenticates . At the same time,  and  negotiate a same session key. Additionally, the confidentiality of privacy messages 
 and 
 and the PFS property of session key 
 are realized.

6.3. Informal security analysis
In this section, we employ informal security analysis to prove the security of the proposed scheme.

(1) Mutual authentication: In the proposed scheme, the VMCS/ VSC-S/UE generates a signature 
/
/
 with its shared key 
/
/
. Thus, the VNCC could authenticate the VMCS, the VSC-S and the UE by verifying the 
, 
 and 
, respectively. Subsequently, the VSC-S checks 
 to authenticate the VNCC since only the designated VNCC can obtain 
 and further generate the valid 
. Then, the VMCS validates the VNCC and VSC-S by checking 
 since only the legitimate VNCC/VSC-S could obtain 
. Finally, the VSC-S checks 
 to authenticate the VMCS since only the designated VMCS holds 
. Additionally, the UE authenticates the VMCS by verifying the authorization information 
.

(2) Session key agreement: The VMCS and the VSC-S negotiate a distinct session key 
 from these secret values 
 and 
. Calculating 
 from the public parameters 
 and 
 is equivalent to solving the difficult problem CMDHP or CMDLP. Thus, the session key agreement between the VMCS and the VSC-S can be accomplished securely.

(3) Identity anonymity: In the proposed scheme, the VMCS’s identity 
 included in the 
 and the VSC-S’s identity 
 included in the 
 are encrypted with the public key of the VNCC 
. Only the designated VNCC can obtain the 
 and 
, and any adversary without the 
 is unable to obtain the identity. Additionally, the VSC-S’s identity 
 containing in the 
 is encrypted with 
. Only the VMCS and the VSC-S can calculate 
. Thus, the proposed scheme holds identity anonymity.

(4) Unlinkability: Since the random number 
 is used in the proposed scheme, these messages from the VMCS are totally different in each session. It is infeasible for an adversary to distinguish whether two different messages come from the same VMCS. Thus, the proposed scheme satisfies unlinkability.

(5) Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS): In the proposed scheme, even having obtained the private key of the VMCS/VNCC/VSC-S/UE, any adversary without the secret value 
 or 
 is still unable to calculate the 
 or 
 and further work out the previous session key. Thus, the proposed scheme supports PFS.

(6) Replay attack resistance: In the proposed scheme, the VNCC could withstand replay attack by checking the freshness of the timestamps 
, 
 and 
. The VMCS could resist replay attack based on the fresh random number 
 generated in each session. The VSC-S and the UE could detect replay attack by checking the freshness of the timestamps 
 and 
, respectively. Hence, the proposed scheme is secure against replay attack.

(7) User impersonation attack resistance: User impersonation attack refers to that non-designated registered vehicle owner or VSC-E impersonates as a designated user to initiate the VMCS/UE or VSC-S. In the proposed scheme, the VMCS and the UE authenticate the vehicle owner by verifying 
 and 
, and the VSC-S verifies the VSC-E by checking 
. Only the designated identity, password and biometrics can pass the verification. Thus, the proposed scheme could resist user impersonation attack.

(8) Stolen smart card attack resistance: Even obtaining all the information 
 stored in the VMCS by the power analysis attack, the adversary has to guess the identity, password and biometrics simultaneously from these equations 
, 
 and 
. Obviously, the probability of correctly guessing the identity, password and biometrics of the vehicle owner simultaneously is negligible. Similarly, even obtaining all the information stored in the VSC-S/UE, the adversary cannot guess the identity, password and biometrics of the VSC-E/vehicle owner correctly. Hence, the proposed scheme could resist stolen smart card attack.

(9) Ephemeral Secret Leakage (ESL) attack resistance: Even obtaining the secret value 
 or 
, the adversary cannot obtain the long-term secret key 
 and then further derive the shared key 
/
/ 
. With out the value 
/
/
, any adversary is unable to calculate the session key 
/
. Thus, the proposed scheme is able to resist ESL attack.

Finally, we compare the security properties of the proposed scheme with other related schemes in He et al., 2015b, Jiang et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2017, Abbasinezhad-Mood and Nikooghadam, 2018, Cui et al., 2020, as shown in Table 2. From Table 2, it can be concluded that the proposed scheme can provide more robust security properties than other related schemes.

7. Performance analysis
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the VSC-based authentication process in the proposed scheme by comparing it with other similar three-party authentication schemes in He et al., 2015b, Jiang et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2017, Abbasinezhad-Mood and Nikooghadam, 2018, Cui et al., 2020 in terms of computational and communication overheads.

For the sake of fairness, we assume that the security strength in these comparison schemes is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 128 bits (Barker et al., 2016). Concretely, the key of symmetric encryption and decryption is 128 bits. The private and public keys of ECC are 256 bits and 512 bits. The output length of the hash function is 256 bits. The output length of the HMAC function is 160 bits and the size of the random number is 128 bits. As far as we know, at present, only exhaustive search can effectively crack the encryption system based on the Chebyshev polynomials, so we assume the key for algorithms based on the Chebyshev polynomials is equivalent to AES 128 bits. Additionally, we assume the size of the privacy message , the identity and the timestamp is 256 bits, 128 bits, and 32 bits, respectively.

We have established a test environment to simulate the proposed VSC-based authentication process. We choose three computers with different performance. Concretely, we select the first computer equipped with Intel(R) Core(TM) m3-6Y30 CPU @0.9 GHz processor as the VMCS with weak performance, the second computer equipped with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7500U CPU @2.70 GHz as the VNCC and the third computer equipped with Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7200U CPU @2.50 GHz as the VSC-S. Subsequently, we install Ubuntu 17.10 platform on these computers. Then, we compile and run the openssl-1.0.2e library on Ubuntu. Based on the openssl-1.0.2e library, we test the time costs of the cryptography operations including ECC point multiplication operation, hash function operation, HMAC function operation, symmetric encryption/decryption operation and two cryptographically strong pseudo-random number generation operations. Here, for hash function operation and symmetric encryption/decryption operation, we consider the SHA-256 algorithm and AES algorithm, respectively. For HMAC function operation, we let the SHA-1 algorithm as a hash engine. Additionally, we adopt the matrix iteration algorithm in Kocarev and Lian (2011) to write the corresponding C language code to test the time cost of the Chebyshev polynomials. The size of these cryptographic operations used in the test is listed in the third column of Table 3. In order to get the ideal test results, we repeat 10 experiments for each cryptographic operation. Further, in each experiment, for these cryptography operations such as symmetric encryption operation, hash operation and so on, the resolution of system time is low and the time spent of each calculation is extremely short, so we repeatedly measure the same set of values for 50000 times. For other operations including ECC point multiplication operation and Chebyshev polynomial operation, we only measure 1000 times due to the relative long time of each calculation.

7.1. Computational overhead
On the computational overhead, we only consider these cryptography operations including the ECC point multiplication operation 
, the Chebyshev polynomial operation 
, the fuzzy extractor operation 
, the symmetric encryption operation 
, the symmetric decryption operation 
, the one-way hash operation 
, the HMAC operation 
, two cryptographically strong pseudo-random number generation operations 
 and 
 while omit other operations. The time cost of these cryptography operations is listed in Table 3. Additionally, according to Roy et al. (2018), 
.

The computational overheads of the proposed scheme and other related schemes are listed in Table 4. Based on the time cost of these cryptography operations, we compare the total computational overheads of the proposed scheme with that of other related schemes as the increase of authentication times, as shown in Fig. 11. From Fig. 11, we can get that the total computational overheads of the proposed scheme are larger than that of the schemes in Jiang et al., 2016, He et al., 2015b and smaller than that of other schemes. The reason why the total computational overheads of the proposed scheme are larger than that of the scheme in Jiang et al. (2016) is that the proposed scheme uses CMDHP to realize PFS, while the scheme in Jiang et al. (2016) cannot achieve PFS. Additionally, the proposed scheme provides significantly more robust security properties that the scheme in He et al. (2015b).

7.2. Communication overhead
On the communication overhead, we compare the communication overheads of these related schemes by calculating the total size of the messages. The number of signaling messages in these comparison schemes is listed in the second column in Table 5. Meanwhile, Table 5 shows the communication overhead of each message in these comparison schemes. Subsequently, we make a comparison of the proposed scheme and other related schemes in terms of the total communication overheads, as shown in Fig. 12.

From Fig. 12, we can easily observe that the total communication overheads of the proposed scheme are slighter larger than that of the scheme in He et al. (2015b) and smaller than that of other related schemes. However, the proposed scheme provides significantly more robust security properties that the scheme in He et al. (2015b).

7.3. Performance analysis under unknown attacks
In this section, we analyze the computational and communication overheads under unknown attacks. Although we have proved that the proposed scheme can resist several kinds of protocol attacks, undoubtedly, there will be some unknown attacks that we cannot judge when and where they happen. In order to analyze the performance under unknown attacks, we assume that when these unknown attacks happen, the authentication process will be terminated. (1)
 

We analyze the computational/communication overheads under unknown attacks by Eq. (1), where 
 represents the average computational/communication overheads under unknown attacks. 
 denotes the total number of authentication and 
. 
 represents the number of successful authentication. 
 indicates the number of failed authentication, that is, the number of unknown attacks happen. 
 refers to the total computational/communication overheads in a successful authentication process. 
 represents the average computational/communication overheads when unknown attacks happen, which can be calculated by Eq. (2). Since we cannot determine in which step the scheme is terminated, we assume that the probability of the termination in each step is equal, that is, , where  is the total number of signaling messages and 
 is the total computational/communication overheads before step . (2)

Fig. 13(b) shows the comparison result of the computational and communication overheads under unknown attacks. To facilitate analysis, we assume 
. From Fig. 13, we can get that the computational overheads under unknown attacks of the proposed scheme are less than that of the scheme in Abbasinezhad-Mood and Nikooghadam, 2018, Cui et al., 2020, similar to that of the scheme in Wang et al. (2017) and slighter larger than that of the schemes in Jiang et al., 2016, He et al., 2015b. From Fig. 13(a), we can get that the communication overheads under unknown attacks of the proposed scheme are larger than that of the scheme in He et al. (2015b) and smaller than the others.

Discussion: In summary, according to the security and performance comparison results in Table 2, Figs. 11, 12 and 13(b), the proposed scheme has the following advantages.

(1). The proposed scheme provides more robust security properties than these schemes in He et al., 2015b, Jiang et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2017, Abbasinezhad-Mood and Nikooghadam, 2018, Cui et al., 2020.

(2). The proposed scheme consumes less computational overheads than the schemes in Wang et al., 2017, Abbasinezhad-Mood and Nikooghadam, 2018, Cui et al., 2020 and less communication overheads than the schemes in Jiang et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2017, Abbasinezhad-Mood and Nikooghadam, 2018, Cui et al., 2020.

(3). The computational and communication overheads under unknown attacks of the proposed scheme are less than that of the scheme in Abbasinezhad-Mood and Nikooghadam, 2018, Cui et al., 2020 and the schemes in Jiang et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2017, Abbasinezhad-Mood and Nikooghadam, 2018, Cui et al., 2020, respectively.

8. Conclusion
In this paper, we present a remote diagnosis and maintenance architecture in 5G V2N. On the basis of this architecture, we propose a robust authentication scheme for vehicle remote diagnosis and maintenance based on extended Chebyshev chaotic maps. In the proposed scheme, before enjoying or providing remote diagnosis and maintenance services, valid biometrics and password must be provided to prevent malicious users from operating the vehicle illegally. Additionally, the mutual authentication and key agreement process between the vehicle and the VSC is accomplished. The security analysis and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme provides robust security with ideal efficiency. By implementing the proposed scheme, both the legal owner and legal temporary driver of vehicles can safely enjoy the remote diagnosis and maintenance services provided by the legal VSC.
