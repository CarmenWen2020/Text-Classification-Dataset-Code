Abstract
Locomotion is one of the fundamental interactions in VR. As a relatively easy and simple method to implement VR locomotion, walking-in-place (WIP) techniques have been actively developed, which have shown advantages in terms of spatial constraints and immersion compared to real walking or controller-based interaction. However, existing WIP gestures have been largely adapted or designed from the perspective of developers, not the users, which may result in not only higher cognitive load to learn and memorize, but also worse presence and increased sensory conflict in VR. Therefore, this study aims to elicit and evaluate WIP gestures for different walking directions (forward, sideways, and backward) from users so that a complete user-defined WIP gesture set for VR locomotion can be generated. Two sequential user studies were conducted. In Experiment 1, 20 participants experienced the movement while wearing the VR headset and elicited the gesture for each of 8 walking directions. The grouping analysis revealed that Turn body + Stepping-in-place (SIP) and Step one foot + SIP/Rock/Stay were promising WIP gesture sets for VR locomotion. In the follow-up experiment (Experiment 2), 21 new participants experienced and compared the generated gesture sets and existing ones. The results showed that SIP performed the best for forward walking, while Step one foot + SIP/Rock/Stay were promising for other walking directions, which depended on application scenarios and the tradeoff between efficiency and naturalness. The generated WIP gesture sets from users can be used in VR applications to provide a better user experience and greater movement options in VR locomotion.

1. Introduction
Virtual reality (VR) has existed for decades, but recently consumers and researchers started to show growing interest as VR becomes much more commercially accessible. VR markets are growing tremendously fast, with the total worldwide market expected to reach 98.4 million sales by 2023, with 168 million units, a worldwide population penetration of 2% installed (Rogers, 2019). Past human-computer interaction methods forced human action to fit the capability of the computer; however, VR experiences are different, because the computer should mimic the real world to provide the experience as realistic as possible. Due to this interaction similar to the real world, interaction methods natural for humans such as gestures, which humans routinely use to interact with the physical world, are considered to be promising.

Virtual travel is one of the most common and universal interactions in VR (Bowman et al., 1998); however, currently available methods for VR locomotion heavily rely on the use of a controller to move and teleport, or the real walking in a confined physical space, neglecting proliferating demands on the method for traveling unlimited virtual space by actually moving the user's feet. As a relatively easy and simple method to implement VR locomotion without using cumbersome and pricy mechanical treadmills (Cakmak and Hager, 2014; Darken et al., 1997; Souman et al., 2011), the system based on walking-in-place (WIP) techniques has been actively developed (Bruno et al., 2017; Feasel et al., 2008; Templeman et al., 1999; Wendt et al., 2010; Wilson et al., 2014).

Although WIP lacks some merits against real walking or controller-based methods, it holds clear advantages that keep it useful. WIP is less favored than real walking, but it requires a small physical space for traveling infinite virtual space, unlike real walking where the same amount of physical space is required. Moreover, it is not only hands-free in most cases but also provides better immersion and spatial perception compared to traditional joystick interfaces by giving vestibular and proprioceptive cues with the movement similar to real walking (Bhandari et al., 2017; Tregillus and Folmer, 2016; Usoh et al., 1999; Williams et al., 2011). It has been shown that it also helps to reduce motion-sickness by handling the sensory conflict (Cherni et al., 2020; Jaeger and Mourant, 2001).

Slater et al. (1995) proposed the first WIP implementation for VR locomotion, adopting the WIP gesture that provides step-like motions while remaining stationary. This gesture is commonly referred to as Marching-in-place or Stepping-in-place (SIP) in distinction from its future derivatives due to its step-like motion characteristics. Since then, the same gesture has been widely adopted in post-WIP-based VR locomotion studies (Bruno et al., 2017; Feasel et al., 2008; Templeman et al., 1999; Wendt et al., 2010; Wilson et al., 2014). Meanwhile, some studies have proposed new gestures that are different from the original WIP gesture that resembles marching. Nilsson et al. (2013) proposed Wiping-in-place and Tapping-in-place gestures. Wiping-in-place gesture requires users to alternately move their feet backward like wiping the floor while bending the moving leg's knee. On the other hand, the Tapping-in-place gesture requires users alternately to lift their heels while having the ball of feet contact the ground. Likewise, Guy et al. (2015) proposed LazyNav with two VR locomotion techniques that require users to either step with one foot towards the corresponding direction to move or to bend their knees alternately, while Ang et al. (2019) proposed the Swing-in-place gesture that users lift one leg from the floor to make the body lean naturally to one side alternately. On the one hand, some WIP implementations (Lee et al., 2018; Tregillus and Folmer, 2016) that utilize IMU embedded in the VR headset require the Jogging-in-place gesture which resembles jogging.

Some approaches have tried to use body parts other than feet, such as the torso or arms, for VR locomotion. The torso was commonly used in Leaning-based interfaces which required a user to lean the body towards the desired direction to navigate. The first Leaning-based interface while standing was proposed by Marchal et al. (2011) and followed by the work of Harris et al. (2014). Harries et al. reported that Leaning had similar spatial orientation but was preferred by 50% more users when compared to SIP. Although Leaning could be used while standing, it has been favorably used in a sitting context (Ganapathi and Sorathia, 2019; Kitson et al., 2017, 2015; Riecke and Feuereissen, 2012). Another stream of approaches is based on the use of Arm-swing gestures. Users swing their arms just like when they are walking, but at the same time keep their legs still (McCullough et al., 2015). However, the merits of Arm-swing are debatable. Arm-swing showed lower energy consumption compared to Jogging-in-place (Pai and Kunze, 2017) but larger turning error and lower spatial awareness than SIP (Wilson et al., 2016). In terms of usability and motion sickness, no obvious advantage of Arm-swing over SIP was found (Calandra et al., 2019). Although these approaches account for some benefits over foot-based interactions, feet remain as a prime modality for VR locomotion because they are naturally mapped to real-life movements, while leaving the user's hands, head, and torso free for other interactions (Al Zayer et al., 2018; von Willich et al., 2020).

Surprisingly, sideways and backward WIP options have been far less frequently considered than forward WIP in WIP-based VR locomotion studies despite their benefits. Sideways and backward WIP can enable prompt movement to the side or back by removing unnecessary body rotations, so they are particularly useful for applications like the VR shooting, action, or adventure games where you need to react and move quickly (Bruno et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2019; Silpasuwanchai and Ren, 2015). Besides, these movement options allow users to move more flexibly when the steering direction is limited as in the case of Bruno et al. (2017). Several studies have considered sideways and backward WIP options. Templeman et al. (1999) proposed new gestures for sideways and backward WIP for VR locomotion. For leftward WIP, the user swings the left leg to the left and then drops it back, and then nominally lifts and drops the right foot on alternate steps (rightward WIP is done along the same lines but symmetrically). For backward WIP, the user swings feet to the back and then drops them alternately while the knees are relatively stationary. This technique also allowed users to move forward or backward diagonally by swinging the knees or feet along a diagonal path. Other studies proposed a different approach that relies on the direction of the head tilt (Lee et al., 2019; Tregillus et al., 2017) or torso leaning (Harris et al., 2014; Kruijff et al., 2016). Instead of adapting to an entirely new set of gestures, the user simply tilts the head to the side or back while performing the WIP gesture or leans the torso to move toward the corresponding direction. Wang et al. (2018) proposed and compared three gestures based on movement of the hip, torso, and sidesteps for sideways WIP, and concluded that torso leaning outperformed others in terms of perceived naturalness and positional drift.

WIP gestures have been largely adapted or designed from the perspective of developers, not the users. Unnatural gestures may result in not only higher cognitive load to learn and memorize (Nacenta et al., 2013; Norman, 2010), but also worse presence and increased sensory conflict which can be critical for providing a better experience in VR (Lee et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2019a). Only a few studies have attempted to elicit gestures for VR locomotion. Silpasuwanchai and Ren (2015) designed full-body gestures for various intense gameplay events and Felberbaum and Lanir (2018) elicited foot gestures for GUI and avatar actions. Walking and running were included in target commands of both studies, but commands were for controlling an avatar in a monitor display, not for locomotion of the user in the immersive head-mounted display-based VR. In the study of Ganapathi and Sorathia (2019), gestures were elicited for VR locomotion but while in a sitting position only. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have elicited WIP gestures for VR locomotion while standing, especially including various directions other than forward.

It is questionable that most users would elicit and prefer the widely adapted step-like WIP gesture for forward walking, and the natural and easy-to-use gestures for sideways and backward walking from the user's point of view are still unknown. Therefore, this study aims to generate a complete WIP gesture set covering whole walking directions including forward, sideways, and backward from the users’ perspective. User-defined gestures were collected, grouped, and evaluated to establish a well-defined WIP gesture set for VR locomotion. We collected gestures in Experiment 1 using the gesture elicitation methodology introduced and refined by Wobbrock and Vatavu (Vatavu and Wobbrock, 2015; Wobbrock et al., 2009), then subjectively assessed the elicited gestures in Experiment 2 with a new group of participants to propose a user-defined WIP gesture set for VR locomotion.

2. Experiment 1: Elicitation of WIP gestures for VR locomotion
2.1. Method
2.1.1. Participants
20 Korean young adults (14 males, 6 females) with a mean age of 24.0 (SD=5.8) participated in the experiment. 17 participants had an experience of using a PC-based commercial VR headset, but 14 among them used the VR headset no more than once a year, showing the majority of participants were light VR users. Only a single participant had prior experience in using WIP for VR locomotion. Therefore, most participants were unaffected by the legacy bias when eliciting gestures, even though it has been claimed legacy bias can be beneficial (Ortega et al., 2017) and little evidence supports the reduction of legacy bias can improve the gesture set (Ortega et al., 2019). All participants gave written consent for the experiment protocol approved by the University Institutional Review Board (IRB NO.: KH2020-069).

2.1.2. Commands and experimental settings
8 commands, representing 8 different walking directions were selected for the elicitation. 8 directions included forward (0°), forward diagonal left (-45°), forward diagonal right (45°), leftward (-90°), rightward (90°), backward diagonal left (-135°), backward diagonal right (135°), and backward (180°). Here, all commands indicate walking towards the corresponding direction in the virtual environment while the head always faces forward. Fig. 1-a visualizes 8 commands used in this study.

Fig. 1. (a) Commands and (b) experimental settings

In this study, we limited the scope of the gesture to the lower extremity only, considering technical challenges in full-body tracking and benefits of unrestrictedness of hands and head in practical use cases. By excluding gestures with the use of other body parts among existing gestures and considering prior comparison results, three forward WIP gestures: Tapping-in-place (Nilsson et al., 2013), Jogging-in-place (Tregillus and Folmer, 2016), and Swing-in-place (Ang et al., 2019) gestures were selected for the evaluation to finalize the best existing WIP gesture set for final comparison between user-elicited gestures and existing ones in a follow-up study (Experiment 2). For other walking directions, Gaiter (Templeman et al., 1999) was the only option among previously introduced gestures using legs and feet only.

The experiment was conducted with the Oculus Quest (resolution: 1440 × 1600 per eye; refresh rate: 72 Hz) VR headset while connected to the PC through Oculus Link with a USB 3.0 cable. Oculus PC software with version 21.0 was used. The PC used to run the VR environment was equipped with an Intel Core i7-7700 processor running at 3.6 GHz, 16 GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU, running Windows 10. A Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor was mounted on a tripod and placed at 2.5 m apart from the participant and 1.0 m apart from the ground facing the participant to record RGB videos (resolution: 1920 × 1080; frame rate: 30 fps). The participant was located inside an ordinary room covered by achromatic-colored walls in VR, developed using Unity3D 2018.4.0f1. Fig. 1-b shows the experimental settings.

2.1.3. Experimental procedure
First, participants were asked to hold the VR headset in front of their chest and walk 3 steps towards each of 8 directions twice, and their walking speed at the second trial was measured with inside-out positional tracking of the VR headset. We believed participants could transfer the feeling when they practice the real walking towards various directions to the elicitation of more naturalistic WIP gestures.

Then, participants equipped the VR headset and experienced each of 8 commands for 3 seconds in randomized order. When displaying the commands, the walking speed was set according to the speed measured earlier to provide the natural feeling when eliciting gestures. After experiencing each command, participants were asked to elicit a single most appropriate WIP gesture for each command. Once the gesture was finalized, the gesture was recorded with the RGB camera in the Kinect sensor together with a verbal explanation about the reason for their design (Think-aloud) and the method to increase the walking speed. No hints were provided to participants during the elicitation process to avoid legacy bias, and participants were allowed to change the gesture they designed earlier at any time when they wanted.

Lastly, participants were asked to perform each of three existing forward WIP gestures for 3-4 walking cycles two times while the command is being displayed by the experimenter using the Wizard of Oz technique (Connell et al., 2013; Ganapathi and Sorathia, 2019; Henschke et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2019a). Right after performing each gesture twice, participants were asked to give ratings on a 7 point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree) for three subjective evaluation items: goodness of fit (“The gesture I picked is a good match for its intended purpose”), ease of use (“The gesture I picked is easy to perform”), and perceived fatigue (“The gesture I picked induces high fatigue”). These subjective evaluation items have been commonly used in gesture elicitation studies (Austin et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2018; Ganapathi and Sorathia, 2019; Piumsomboon et al., 2013; Wobbrock et al., 2009).

2.1.4. Data analysis
With 20 participants and 8 commands, a total of 160 WIP gestures were collected. Elicited gestures were first decomposed into two components: indication of direction and movement, and were grouped considering motion characteristics of gestures and verbal explanations of participants recorded in videos. Then, the agreement rate (AR) was calculated for each command (Vatavu and Wobbrock, 2015) to evaluate the degree of agreement among gestures elicited from different participants:
 
 
 
where P stands for the total number of elicited gestures for a command c, and Pi stands for the number of a subset i of identical gestures from P. According to Vatavu and Wobbrock (2015), qualitative interpretations for AR are as follows: a low agreement when AR < 0.1, a moderate agreement when 0.1 ≤ AR < 0.3, a high agreement when 0.3 ≤ AR < 0.5, and a very high agreement when AR ≥ 0.5.

According to the Grubbs’ outlier test, no outliers were detected in the experimental data. The Ryan-Joiner test for normality showed that the ratings for goodness of fit and ease of use followed the normal distribution, while the ratings for perceived fatigue did not. For comparison between three existing gestures for the forward WIP, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Tukey tests were conducted to check the statistical significance of each subjective evaluation item. Minitab 19 was used to conduct all statistical analyses at a significance level of 0.05. The variation from participants was blocked.

2.2. Results
2.2.1. Grouping results and gesture characteristics
Table 1 lists the user-elicited gesture components and their frequencies and AR by direction and movement indication. For direction indication, 8 groups with different gesture components were formed. Turn body and Step one foot were two components that were elicited dominantly more than others across all directions with average frequencies of 8.4 and 7.6 out of 20 respectively. A very high agreement was found at 0°, a high agreement was found at ±135° and 180°, and a medium agreement was found at ±45° and ±90°. For movement indication, 14 groups were formed, representing SIP as the most dominant gesture component with an average frequency of 8.2, followed by Rock (3.2) and Stay (2.0). High agreement was found at 0°, a medium agreement was found at ±45°, ±90°, and ±135°, and a low agreement was found at 180°. Fig. 2 shows a few examples of the gestures elicited by participants.


Table 1. Frequency (percentage) of user-elicited gesture components and AR by direction and movement indication category. For ±45°, ±90°, and ±135°, all elicited gestures were symmetrical for the left and right directions thereby result in the identical grouping result.

According to the reason for the design, 50% of participants explained that they put most effort to imitate the motion characteristics of real walking to get a similar feeling, while 35% of participants put more emphasis to get the feeling of moving towards a certain direction. The rest considered maximizing their comfort when performing the gesture by minimizing awkward or excessive leg movements. For factors to control the walking speed, step frequency was mentioned the most with a proportion of 69% among all elicitation cases, followed by step length (9%) and foot height (7%).

2.2.2. Comparison between existing gestures
Fig. 3 shows the subjective ratings on three existing forward WIP gestures. The ANOVA results showed that the Tapping-in-place gesture outperformed Jogging-in-place and Swing-in-place gestures in terms of goodness of fit (F2,38=12.57, p<.001), ease of use (F2,38=6.74, p=.003), and perceived fatigue (F2,38=23.36, p<.001). According to the post hoc grouping, the Tapping-in-place gesture induced significantly higher goodness of fit (M=5.6, SD=1.4) compared to the Swing-in-place gesture (M=4.5, SD=4.5), and significantly lower perceived fatigue (M=1.6, SD=0.9) compared to the Jogging-in-place gesture (M=3.8, SD=1.8). For ease of use, the Tapping-in-place gesture (M=6.3, SD=1.0) was superior to both the Jogging-in-place gesture (M=5.2, SD=1.5) and the Swing-in-place gesture (M=5.0, SD=1.4).

2.3. Discussion
For direction indication, participants either turned their body or stepped one foot towards the corresponding direction in most cases (80%). Turn body was chosen more than Step one foot to indicate direction at forward and backward directions, while it was opposite for sideways (±45°, ±90°, and ±135°) directions. It is worthy to note that at 90° direction, more participants preferred to first lift the closer foot and make it higher than the other foot to indicate direction instead of turning their body towards 90°. The range of motion of active neck axial rotation of healthy young adults is around 80° (Ferrario et al., 2002), indicating ordinary participants need to maintain maximum neck rotation which yields severe fatigue on the neck muscle. Moreover, it is common that the human prefers the asymmetric gallop-like gait pattern in sideways locomotion (Yamashita et al., 2013). Due to the same circumstance, Turn body at 135°, -135°, and 180° means turning the body towards the opposite direction (-45°, 45°, and 0°, respectively) and conducting the gesture representing backward walking due to the structural inability of the human body.

For movement indication, the SIP gesture was dominantly elicited (41% of all cases), which is expected considering that this gesture has been widely known to common users and researchers (Bruno et al., 2017; Feasel et al., 2008; Templeman et al., 1999; Wendt et al., 2010; Wilson et al., 2014). This result is consistent with the previous study (Felberbaum and Lanir, 2018). One interesting point was that participants tended to utilize the SIP gesture at directions other than 0° even though the dominance was less. This makes sense considering that participants generally attempt to transfer their prior knowledge and experience to new ones (Wu et al., 2019c). In the same manner, participants tended to apply the same design standard when designing gestures in different directions. 45% of participants designed the gestures with the same components in all directions (e.g. Step one foot + Rock), whereas 35% of participants elicited the same type of gestures in sideways but not in forward and backward directions. All participants elicited symmetrical gestures for the left and right directions, which is in line with participants’ behavior reported in previous studies where participants tended to adopt reversible gestures for dichotomous tasks (Chen et al., 2018; Wobbrock et al., 2009; Wu and Wang, 2012).

In both direction and movement indication categories, AR was the highest at 0°, showing very high agreement for direction indication and high agreement for movement indication. This was because the majority of participants elicited the SIP gesture while facing forward. The agreement declined at other unfamiliar walking directions, as participants could come up with more creative solutions, being free from interruptions from the prior knowledge. The design choices varied the most at 90° for direction indication, and the agreement was the lowest at 180° for movement indication because some participants created their own novel gestures which could be distinguished from the common SIP gesture designed for 0°. There was no significant difference between the range of AR reported in this study and the one reported in other gesture elicitation studies (Austin et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2020, 2019b).

For factors to control the walking speed, step frequency was most dominant, followed by step length and foot height. This result should be valid considering step frequency determines the real walking speed (Wendt et al., 2010), and has a positive trend in the relationship with the perceptually natural walking speed gains (Nilsson et al., 2014). It is further supported by Dean (1965)’s equation defining the relationship between walking speed, step frequency, and subject height (positively correlates with step length) which shows a good fit with the data from biomechanics studies (Murray et al., 1970, 1964; Oberg et al., 1993). WIP-based VR locomotion techniques such as GUD-WIP (Wendt et al., 2010) and SAS-WIP (Bruno et al., 2013) have taken these factors into account to determine the virtual walking speed. The dominance of step frequency over step length was found in this study, possibly because participants could recall step frequency more easily than step length due to the in-place nature of the designed gestures.

Although the gesture elicitation methodology can be effective for extracting gestures from users’ mental models, participants may not always elicit the best gesture considering all possibilities due to the limited time and mental resources, thus gestures with the highest frequency could be considered intuitive but may not be optimal (Choi et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2019c). To confirm the best WIP gesture set for VR locomotion, we subjectively assessed high-frequency gestures as suggested by previous studies (Chen et al., 2018; Dim et al., 2016; Ganapathi and Sorathia, 2019; Silpasuwanchai and Ren, 2015). Instead of investigating all gestures, components proposed by more than two participants on average were chosen for further evaluation (Chen et al., 2018). This was to keep the number of choices optimal (approximately three to six choices; Silpasuwanchai and Ren, 2015) and the experimental duration acceptable to avoid adding cognitive burdens to participants. Unpopular gestures uniquely designed for certain walking directions were naturally excluded maintaining consistency between gestures in different directions for better learnability and memorability.

This process resulted in top 2 components: Turn body and Step one foot for direction indication, and top 3 components: SIP, Rock, and Stay for movement indication, ultimately forming four gesture sets: Turn body + SIP (TSIP), Step one foot + SIP (SSIP), Step one foot + Rock (Rock), and Step one foot + Stay (Stay) by combining each component. As the body cannot be rocked without stepping one foot and staying without stepping one foot is indistinguishable from the neutral standing posture, combinations of Turn body + Rock and Turn body + Stay were excluded. As the Tapping-in-place gesture outperformed the other two existing WIP gestures for forward walking, it was chosen to construct the existing gesture set. The existing gesture set consisted of a combination of the Tapping-in-place gesture for forward and Gaiter (Templeman et al., 1999) gestures for other directions. By adding the existing gesture set (Exist), five gesture sets (Fig. 4) were finalized for further evaluation in a follow-up experiment (Experiment 2).

For TSIP, the user first lifts the closer foot and makes it higher than the other foot while facing front at 90° and turns body towards the opposite direction at 135° and 180°.

3. Experiment 2: Follow-up evaluation of user-elicited and existing gesture sets
3.1. Method
3.1.1. Participants
A new group of 21 Korean young adults (19 males, 2 females) with a mean age of 26.1 (SD=5.9) participated in the follow-up experiment. 18 participants had an experience of using a PC-based commercial VR headset, but 14 among them used the VR headset equal or less than once a year, showing the majority of participants were light VR users similar to the case in Experiment 1. None had prior experience in using WIP for VR locomotion. All participants gave written consent for the experiment protocol approved by the University Institutional Review Board (IRB NO.: KH2020-069).

3.1.2. Experimental settings and procedure
Experimental settings were identical to the settings of Experiment 1 (Fig 1-b). As all participants elicited symmetrical gestures in Experiment 1, the left and right directions were combined into a single category thereby result in 5 walking directions: 0°, (±)45°, (±)90°, (±)135°, and 180°. Finally, 5 gesture sets × 5 directions = 25 gestures (Fig. 4) were selected for the evaluation. First, a video demonstration of all gestures was shown to new participants, and participants were asked to practice each gesture. The experimenter examined their gestures carefully and corrected them in case they misunderstood. Evaluation of gestures was conducted along the same lines as the procedure for evaluation of existing gestures in Experiment 1, but with an addition of positional drift adopted from the study of Nilsson et al. (2013). In this study, we measured positional displacement of the user between before and after the gesture performed. While participants performed the same gestures twice for 0° and 180° directions, they performed the gesture once for the left and once for the right symmetrically for 45°, 90°, and 135° directions. After giving ratings for all gestures in randomized order for a certain direction, participants were asked to select the most preferred gesture and describe the reason. Average real walking speed across all participants measured from Experiment 1 for each direction was used to determine the virtual walking speed when displaying commands.

3.1.3. Data analysis
Ratings of subjective evaluation items and positional drift for each gesture and direction were collected and arranged for the statistical analysis. To identify the best gesture at each direction to generate a complete WIP gesture set, data were split by direction and tested separately for statistical significance. No outliers in subjective ratings were detected according to the Grubbs’ outlier test, whereas 4 outliers in positional drift were detected and further excluded. The Ryan-Joiner test for normality showed that all subjective ratings followed a normal distribution except for ease of use at 0° and perceived fatigue at 0°, 135°, and 180°. However, all positional drift measures did not follow a normal distribution. ANOVA and Tukey post hoc grouping tests were conducted using Minitab 19 with a significance level of 0.05. The variation from participants was blocked. The effect size in terms of eta-squared (η2 = SSTreatment/SSTotal) was further calculated to check practical significance. A general rule on the magnitudes of the effect size with η2 is as follows: small-η2 ~ 0. 01, medium-η2 ~ 0. 06 and large-η2 ~ 0. 14 (Cohen, 1988).

3.2. Results
3.2.1. Subjective evaluation and preference
The detailed comparison of the mean ratings on five gesture sets in each direction is depicted in Fig. 5. At 0°, TSIP outperformed the others in goodness of fit (F4,80=4.89, p<.001), and SSIP in ease of use (F4,80=7.92, p<.001) and perceived fatigue (F4,80=7.81, p<.001). At 45°, Stay outperformed TSIP and SSIP in ease of use (F4,80=18.42, p<.001), while Rock and Stay outperformed TSIP and SSIP in perceived fatigue (F4,80=17.53, p<.001). Similarly at 90°, Stay outperformed others in ease of use (F4,80=25.13, p<.001), whereas Rock and Stay outperformed TSIP and SSIP in perceived fatigue (F4,80=19.73, p<.001). At 135°, SSIP, Rock, and Stay outperformed TSIP in goodness of fit (F4,80=7.33, p<.001) and ease of use (F4,80=45.37, p<.001). Rock and Stay outperformed TSIP and SSIP in perceived fatigue (F4,80=23.15, p<.001). At 180°, the significant difference between gestures was found only in ease of use (F4,80=18.86, p<.001) and perceived fatigue (F4,80=15.37, p<.001) where Stay outperformed TSIP and SSIP. In all directions and subjective evaluation items, Exist performed worse or similarly compared to other gestures (i.e., user-elicited gestures).

3.2.2. Positional drift
Fig. 7 shows positional drift by direction and gesture. In all cases, the mean positional drift ranged between 0.03 m and 0.10 m. In all directions, positional drift differed significantly across gesture sets, and a similar pattern was found where the positional drift of TSIP and SSIP was larger than the one of Rock and Stay. The positional drift of Exist was the lowest at 0° (M=0.024, SD=0.02) but stayed around the middle in other directions.

3.3. Discussion
For forward walking (0°), TSIP showed the best performance in both subjective evaluation and overall preference, which is consistent with its dominance found in Experiment 1. Interestingly, Exist (Tapping-in-place) had lower goodness of fit compared to TSIP, and no significant difference was found in perceived fatigue in this study; whereas no significant difference in naturalness was found, and SIP had higher physical strain compared to Tapping-in-place in the study of Nilsson et al. (2013). This discrepancy might be due to the following two reasons: (1) Our study asked participants to conduct the gesture while experiencing the walking with the fixed speed using the Wizard of Oz technique, but Nilsson et al. (2013) used their own motion tracking algorithm to track participants’ feet movement and equations to determine walking speed in real-time. It is possible that their algorithms could compensate for the unfamiliar nature of the Tapping-in-place gesture. (2) The task used in our study was to perform each gesture for 6-8 gait cycles in total while the virtual avatar is moving. On the other hand, the task used in the study of Nilsson et al. (2013) was to walk through a 400 meters long curved path. It is uncertain exactly how many gait cycles were needed to complete the task, but there is a high chance that their task required a greater number of cycles, consequentially leads to a more obvious difference in perceived fatigue. Therefore, it can be claimed that the proper implementation of Tapping-in-place in longer walking scenarios may induce equivalent goodness of fit and lower fatigue compared to SIP.

Regarding sideways and backward walking directions, the results were different. Rock and Stay tended to outperform TSIP and SSIP in terms of ease of use and perceived fatigue in all directions other than 0°, although the gap with Stay was more evident. On the contrary, significant differences between four generated gesture sets were rarely found in goodness of fit with only two exceptions at 135° that TSIP had lower goodness of fit ratings compared to others. The prominence of the difference between gestures in ease of use and perceived fatigue was also represented by large effect sizes (η2>.12), indicating Stay could be considered the best gesture set based on the result of subjective ratings. It is worth noting that the Stay gesture for forward walking has been elicited and proposed for intense shooting, adventure, and role-playing gameplay scenarios (Silpasuwanchai and Ren, 2015). Exist was the worst overall, and it never outperformed any proposed WIP gesture sets in any subjective evaluation items. This result is understandable since the gestures are from Gaiter (Templeman et al., 1999), pioneering research focused on the technical implementation of the WIP-based VR locomotion system, not the gesture itself.

On the other hand, further qualitative analysis about reasons revealed that the preference significantly varies depends on which aspect the user puts priority on. Some participants preferred Stay as it was easy and comfortable to perform the gesture, setting a high value on comfort as shown in the result of subjective evaluation. Another group of participants preferred SSIP since it felt much more like actual walking to a certain direction due to the non-static leg movement, emphasizing the sense of reality and feeling of movement. The reason why the largest number of participants preferred Rock was because participants thought Rock had merits from both SSIP and Stay. Many of them mentioned Rock feels more fun and realistic than Stay by moving their legs, but not too tiring like in SSIP. This lead to the result that Rock and SSIP were preferred similarly or more compared to Stay in terms of the number of choices for the best gesture in each direction, which is consistent with the result of Experiment 1 where 85% of participants emphasized getting the feeling similar to the real walking or feeling of moving towards a certain direction, while only 15% focused on the comfort when eliciting gestures. Therefore, we can conclude the sense of reality and vividness are important factors for participants to choose the gesture for VR locomotion.

Finally, the VR developers should be conscious of the positional drift when implementing proposed WIP gestures. Although the result showed less than 0.1 m of mean positional drift at a single trial regardless of the gesture, a large amount of positional drift accumulated by repetitive execution of gestures may drag the user out of the safety boundary thus potentially harm the user. According to the results, this risk can be higher at TSIP and SSIP compared to Rock and Stay. To resolve this issue, users can consider standing on a flat pad during the execution of gestures to sense when they go out of the boundary (Wilson et al., 2014), or developers can display the virtual translucent wall when users get close to play-area borders like in Oculus Guardian System.

3.3.1. Design implications
Our findings suggested that VR developers could consider providing three different gesture choices (SSIP, Rock, and Stay) to accommodate user variability and to provide better user experience in all cases. If only one choice must be made due to practical constraints, developers can select based on the major focus of the user experience that they want their VR application to deliver. SSIP would be the most suitable choice for maximizing the sense of reality or causing a certain degree of exercise effect like in the case of exergames, whereas Stay can be the best choice in scenarios where the user should navigate the virtual environment comfortably for a long term. For general use, Rock can work as the best compromise with a balanced tradeoff between efficiency and naturalness. In addition, it is recommended to replace the gesture for forward walking with the one of TSIP, which is same as the common well-known SIP gesture. This gesture performed similarly or better than all other gestures and was preferred the most by participants thereby worthy to consider. However, it is unclear whether users can benefit from the superiority of this gesture or suffer from the inconsistency of gestures across different directions; hence it needs to be investigated in further studies.

Our proposed WIP gesture set can contribute to providing a high level of enjoyment and immersion to users for VR locomotion. Generated gesture sets can be applied in any gesture-based VR applications for enabling locomotion with enhanced user experience. It is expected that movement options on non-forward directions can enable prompt movement to the side or back by removing unnecessary body rotation, which can be considered especially useful for applications like the VR shooting, action, or adventure games where users need to quickly react and move to non-forward directions frequently (Bruno et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2019; Silpasuwanchai and Ren, 2015).

It is worthy to note that VR developers should also take practical issues into consideration when implementing gestures, since users could still suffer with good gestures if they are not implemented properly. WIP techniques can be implemented based on direct mapping of user input or gesture recognition, and developers should apply the best way which can minimize system latency (Feasel et al., 2008; Wendt et al., 2010) without sacrificing detection accuracy by considering their purpose and usage scenarios.

4. Limitations and future work
This study has some limitations. First, studies have shown the existence of cultural bias on freehand gesture interaction (Wu et al., 2020, 2019c), thus it is unknown whether our results can be generalized to non-Koreans. However, it is expected that WIP gestures would be influenced less by culture since they stand on the basis of the universal gesture of human gait. Furthermore, it has been reported that tasks strongly associated with direction are less sensitive to cultural bias (Wu et al., 2020). Second, the gestures were evaluated under a relatively short experience of commands based on the Wizard-of-Oz technique. As technical issues for gesture recognition were not considered when eliciting gestures, practical problems such as detection accuracy may arise when the proposed gestures were implemented in the VR locomotion system, especially if the system is used for a long period of time. Further study can validate the proposed gestures under more realistic and long-term use cases on a standardized testbed (Buttussi and Chittaro, 2019; Cannavo et al., 2020; Sarupuri et al., 2018) to investigate VR-specific aspects including presence and motion sickness.

5. Conclusion
We conducted two sequential user studies to generate a complete user-defined WIP gesture set for VR locomotion. We first elicited WIP gestures for VR locomotion to 8 walking directions (0°, ±45°, ±90°, ±135°, and 180°) from users. Based on the grouping analysis, WIP gesture sets of Turn body + SIP and Step one foot + SIP/Rock/Stay were selected to be assessed with the existing gesture set in a follow-up experiment. According to the evaluation results, SIP performed the best for forward walking, while Step one foot + SIP/Rock/Stay were promising for other walking directions, which depended on application scenarios and the tradeoff between efficiency and naturalness. The comparison with the existing gestures showed significantly better performance from our proposed gesture sets. Those findings suggested that the generated user-defined WIP gesture sets can be used in VR applications to provide a better user experience and greater movement options in VR locomotion.
