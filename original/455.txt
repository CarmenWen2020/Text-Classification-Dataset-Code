As an emerging computing paradigm, mobile edge computing (MEC) can improve users’ service experience by provisioning the cloud resources close to the mobile devices. With MEC, computation-intensive tasks can be processed on the MEC servers, which can greatly decrease the mobile devices’ energy consumption and prolong their battery lifetime. However, the highly dynamic task arrival and wireless channel states pose great challenges on the computation task allocation in MEC. This paper jointly investigates the task allocation and CPU-cycle frequency, to achieve the minimum energy consumption while guaranteeing that the queue length is upper bounded. We formulate it as a stochastic optimization problem, and with the aid of stochastic optimization methods, we decouple the original problem into two deterministic optimization subproblems. An online Task Offloading and Frequency Scaling for Energy Efficiency (TOFFEE) algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal solutions of these subproblems concurrently. TOFFEE can obtain the close-to-optimal energy consumption while bounding the applications’ queue length. Performance evaluation is conducted which verifies TOFFEE’s effectiveness. Experiment results indicate that TOFFEE can decrease the energy consumption by about 15 percent compared with the RLE algorithm, and by about 38 percent compared with the RME algorithm.
