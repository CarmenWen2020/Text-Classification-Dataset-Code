With the rapid development of cloud services, huge volume of data is shared via cloud computing. Although cryptographic techniques have been utilized to provide data confidentiality in cloud computing, current mechanisms cannot enforce privacy concerns over ciphertext associated with multiple owners, which makes co-owners unable to appropriately control whether data disseminators can actually disseminate their data. In this paper, we propose a secure data group sharing and conditional dissemination scheme with multi-owner in cloud computing, in which data owner can share private data with a group of users via the cloud in a secure way, and data disseminator can disseminate the data to a new group of users if the attributes satisfy the access policies in the ciphertext. We further present a multiparty access control mechanism over the disseminated ciphertext, in which the data co-owners can append new access policies to the ciphertext due to their privacy preferences. Moreover, three policy aggregation strategies, including full permit, owner priority and majority permit, are provided to solve the privacy conflicts problem caused by different access policies. The security analysis and experimental results show our scheme is practical and efficient for secure data sharing with multi-owner in cloud computing.
