Abstract
Virtual Reality (VR) is increasingly being used as a tool to assess or train memory. Factors specific to VR, like immersion and sense of presence, are known to modulate episodic memory of virtual environment (VE). However, the impacts of their interaction have received less attention. The present study was designed to investigate this question. Moreover, it has been shown that episodic memory is influenced by emotion. We therefore also investigated the effect of emotion on memory of VE and its interaction with immersion and sense of presence. Immersion was manipulated using two types of device (Head-mounted Display or Computer Screen) and varying the 3D model quality (High or Low). Emotion was manipulated by presenting negative, positive and neutral stimuli in VE. 108 young adults, forming four experimental groups, took part in this experiment. Sense of presence and emotional experience in different virtual places were assessed using questionnaires, and memory of the stimuli viewed in these places, determined using a free recall task, was also assessed. Results showed that, unlike emotion, immersion had no direct impact on memory. However, an emotional enhancement of memory was found only in the HMD condition. In addition, sense of presence was greater in the HMD condition, but the link between sense of presence and memory performance was weak. Crucially, emotion and device type, but not image quality, increased the sense of presence. Implications of these findings for the elaboration of virtual experiences and the limitations of this study are discussed.

1. Introduction
As of 2016, ever since head-mounted displays (HMD) for virtual reality (VR) have been available to the general public, the number of scientific publications on memory in connection with VR has doubled (see Smith, 2019for a review). Indeed, VR is being increasingly used as a tool to study different types of memory or factors that influence memory performance, such as emotion for example. By contrast, fewer studies have examined the impact of different factors specific to VR per se, such as immersion and the sense of presence (SoP), on memory of the content of virtual experience.

Generally, VR is used to create virtual worlds that are as immersive as possible in order to make users feel as if they are “really there”. In the present study, we use the term immersion to refer to the objective capacity of the technology to deliver sensorial stimulations and movement tracking (e.g., head, hands) comparable to their physiological manifestations in the physical world (Slater, 2003). The feeling of “being there” is called the sense of presence (SoP) and corresponds, according to some authors, to the subjective reaction to immersion (Lessiter et al., 2001; Slater, 2003). If the focus is placed on the cognitive factors that underlie SoP, then attention, perception, and embodiment seem to be the most important (Schubert et al., 2001; Schuemie et al., 2001, for review; Witmer and Singer, 1998). It is assumed that the more immersed and present someone feels while exposed to a virtual world, then the more satisfactory and memorable the VR experience is. However, the distinction between immersion and SoP is not universally accepted (Witmer and Singer, 1998). Even if we assume that a clear separation exists between immersion and SoP, there is some experimental evidence showing that users feel more present with a more immersive system (North and North, 2016). This in turn suggests that immersion and presence are in some way interconnected. However, Yildirim et al. (2019) recently showed that, as measured by different types of subjective scales, sense of presence is not sensitive to various immersive tools (360° video, 3D animation, 3D game). Thus, the respective roles of immersion and SoP in VR experiments and their influence on memory remain unclear and need further investigation. The main objective of the present study was to provide fresh evidence concerning the respective influence of immersion and SoP on the episodic memory of neutral and emotional stimuli experienced in a virtual environment.

2. Background
2.1. Immersion: memory and sense of presence
As described above, SoP seems to be at least partly dependent on perception which, in turn, is influenced by the physical characteristics of the virtual environment and the technology used to deliver it. In other words, SoP may partly depend on the level of immersion. Different methods have been used to manipulate immersion (e.g., field-of-view size, the VR display, the levels of visual fidelity of the 3D models) in studies that have investigated its influence on SoP. For example, in a study using a driving simulator, Lin et al. (2002) manipulated immersion by modulating the size of the field-of-view. The authors measured the level of presence by means of an 8-item questionnaire which included four factors (sensory, distraction, realism, control) usually associated with the concept of presence. The results showed that presence increased significantly with increasing field-of-view. Interestingly, the authors also examined the memory of the virtual experience (e.g. shapes, colors, events) using a multiple-choice questionnaire and showed that memory performance was better for a larger field-of-view and was positively correlated with presence. In fact, presence seems to be a key concept for understanding how memory works in VR and some other studies have already investigated this point (e.g., Buttussi and Chittaro, 2018; Davis et al., 1999; Dinh et al., 1999; Makowski et al., 2017; Mania and Chalmers, 2001; Sutcliffe et al., 2005). These studies used different methods to manipulate levels of immersion and to measure presence and memory and obtained somewhat contradictory results. Recently, Buttussi and Chittaro (2018), for example, used three displays to present a serious game designed to train users in aviation safety procedures (standard desktop monitor and two types of HMD differing in the size of the field-of-view and number of trackers). Presence was assessed by means of a questionnaire and memory by an oral knowledge test performed before and after the training. The results showed that SoP was greater with a more immersive system (more advanced HMD) than with a less immersive system (standard desktop monitor). However, despite this difference in SoP, memory performance did not differ significantly as a function of the display. The influence of different kinds of displays on SoP and memory was also examined by Mania and Chalmers (2001), who used four immersion conditions: real world, 3D desktop monitor, 3D HMD, audio-only. They showed that both memory of a 15-minute seminar and SoP were greatest in the real-world condition, but that the level of SoP was not positively correlated with memory performance in any of the immersion conditions. On the other hand, Dinh et al. (1999), manipulated immersion by adding different kinds of sensory stimulation (olfactory, auditory, tactile) to their VE in addition to visual details, which were either high or low fidelity. The authors compared self-reported presence and memory for these environments. The results showed that presence was greater when auditory and tactile information was included in the environment. However, the level of visual fidelity did not impact the sense of presence. Concerning memory performance (recall of the location of objects), only tactile and olfactory information increased memory performance. A higher level of presence for VEs with ambient sounds than for VEs without sounds was also observed by Davis et al. (1999). Interestingly, the recall of objects and their location was not significantly improved by ambient sound, whereas the recognition of the same objects was. All these studies exploring the relation between the level of immersion, SoP and memory show that the interrelation – higher level of immersion leading to greater SoP and better memory performance – is not as straightforward as might be assumed. As suggested by Buttussi and Chittaro (2018), one of the possible explanations for this discrepancy in the results might be the emotional experience that the participant feels during the task, and which can be induced in different ways (e.g., the stimuli included in the VE, the ambient atmosphere, the music, the scenario). Indeed, the procedure used in Buttussi and Chittaro's (2018) study was more emotional than that used in other studies. In their study, the participants were asked to deal with difficult and stressful situations (e.g. turbulences, injured passengers). Thus, it is possible that emotion may have an impact on SoP and memory and/or on the link between presence and memory.

2.2. Emotion: memory and sense of presence
Emotion is known to have a great impact on memory (Kensinger and Schacter, 2016, for a review). Indeed, an Emotional Enhancement of Memory (EEM), corresponding to the better retrieval of emotional stimuli (positive and negative) than of neutral ones, has been frequently described in the literature. There are several hypotheses concerning the mechanisms via which EEM occurs. According to the attention-mediation hypothesis, emotion draws attention toward the emotional stimuli, and this makes it possible to prioritize the processing of these stimuli and consequently improves encoding. In turn, improved encoding leads to better memory retrieval for emotional stimuli than for neutral ones (Kensinger and Corkin, 2004).The studies that have led to this suggestion have mostly been conducted with protocols that did not use VR. Only very few studies have systematically assessed the effects of emotion on memory of virtual experiences. For example, Schöne et al. (2019) showed that memory of a virtual motorcycle ride, which they considered as highly emotional, was modulated by the level of immersion (HMD versus 2D video on a computer screen). Indeed, the participants’ recognition of the experienced scenes was better in the HMD than the 2D video condition. In addition, mood evaluation did not differ between these two conditions, but did correlate with memory performance in the HMD condition, with recognition performance being better, the more positive the mood was. In this study, SoP was not evaluated. Makowski et al. (2017) manipulated immersion by making the participants watch a movie in a theater in 3D or 2D format and measured SoP, emotional experience and memory (factual and temporal) by means of on-line questionnaires. Thus, in this study, immersion was manipulated on the basis of the movie viewing condition (3D or 2D) in a naturalistic environment. The results showed that SoP was strongly correlated with experienced emotion and factual memory but not with the level of immersion. In addition, emotion and factual memory were also correlated. More importantly, the mediation analysis showed that presence mediated the link between emotion and memory. The authors suggested that emotional events in a VE could be viewed as a pre-attentional mechanism that increases perceptual and attentional processing in a bottom-up manner and that this enhances memory encoding. Nevertheless, even though memory and emotions were assessed in this study, a movie is a very long and complex content. Thus, it is possible that the evaluation of emotion was distorted. For example, a scene could be evaluated as more tragic than it was when it actually occurred if the characters die at the end of the movie. Moreover, emotion was not manipulated by the experimental procedure, it was only measured.

The suggestion made by Makowski et al. (2017) that emotional enhancement of memory of virtual experiences may be partly related to the effects of emotion on SoP is supported by several studies showing that SoP is modulated by emotion (Baños et al., 2004; Buttussi and Chittaro, 2018; Riva et al., 2007; Strack et al., 2016). The manipulation most frequently used in these studies has consisted in creating environments that induce specific moods. Baños et al. (2004), for example, used two types of virtual content that was supposed to induce emotional changes in participants' moods (sad mood versus neutral mood). More precisely, the sad content was obtained by modifying different elements composing the virtual environment, in this case a park, such as the lighting parameters and the music played during exposure to the environment, thus resulting in neutral and sad park conditions. In addition, the authors manipulated immersion by using different types of display (standard computer screen, big screen and HMD). The authors observed that the sad environment elicited a higher sense of presence than the neutral environment even with a weakly immersive system, namely the computer screen. The authors interpreted these results as providing evidence that sense of presence is not only elicited by immersion, but that other factors, such as emotion, may also play an important role. Similar results were reported by Riva et al. (2007) for anxious, relaxing and neutral environments (parks, as in the Baños et al. study). That is to say that they reported higher SoP for the two emotional parks than for the neutral one. More recently, Gromer et al. (2019) confirmed these results by reporting that SoP was greater in a highly realistic emotional environment inducing fear (height exposure) than in an environment that did not induce fear (forest exposure), irrespective of the level of realism (visual properties and sound presence). At the same time, and as mentioned before, some other studies have suggested that SoP is modulated by attention (Witmer and Singer, 1998). Indeed, if users are more focused on the virtual environment, the more likely they are to feel present in this environment. Interestingly, attention has been shown to be modulated by emotion (Pourtois et al., 2013), reflecting the idea that emotional stimuli are thought to rapidly attract attention and enhance perceptual processing. Thus, these studies suggest that, by attracting attention to a virtual stimulus or virtual environment, emotion may enhance SoP.

To summarize, various studies have shown that memory for virtual events is linked to a number of different factors: immersion, presence and emotion. Furthermore, these three factors are related to each other because they are based, at least in part, on the same cognitive processes (e.g., attentional, perceptual). However, the current level of knowledge does not allow us to draw conclusions concerning the specific role of each of these factors in memory functioning in VR. Thus, the purpose of this study was to clarify the respective roles of immersion, SoP and emotion in memory for stimuli experienced in VR. We manipulated immersion by using two types of visual display (HMD versus classic computer screen) and two levels of visual fidelity (high-quality 3D model versus low-quality). In all the studies reviewed above, emotion was elicited by a general change in the virtual environment. However, it is also possible that the emotion may be provoked by certain emotional elements that appear for a specific duration in a virtual environment that otherwise remains stable (e.g., a lion in the bush). As far as we know, the impact of this type of emotion on the sense of presence and memory in VR has not yet been investigated. Thus, in the present study, we decided to manipulate the emotional valence of the specific elements (positive, negative and neutral stimuli) presented in an unchanged environment in order to investigate the way it modulates presence and, consequently, memory. We predicted that emotion would have a greater effect on memory in the best immersion condition (high-quality 3D model displayed on HMD) than in the poorest immersion condition (low-quality 3D model displayed on CS). Concerning the intermediate conditions (low-quality 3D model displayed on HMD and high-quality 3D model quality displayed on CS), we speculated that the low-quality 3D model with HMD condition would lead to a greater EEM than the high-quality 3D model with CS condition, thus suggesting that the display is more important than the image quality for EEM.

3. Method
3.1. Participants
A total of one hundred and eight students, split into four experimental groups, participated in the experiment (Mage = 21.3, range = 18–27; see below for a description of the groups). All the participants were students at Lyon 2 University and had given their written informed consent before participating. All were volunteers and had declared having good hearing and vision. This study was approved by the Ethical Review Board (Comité de Protection des Personnes Ilede France X, No. 2018-A01669–46).

Each participant was exposed to the virtual experience in one of the four following conditions: high-quality image with HMD (N = 24; Mage = 21.1; 12 women and 12 men); low-quality image with HMD (N = 24, Mage = 20.2; 12 women and 12 men); high-quality image on computer screen (N = 30; Mage = 22; 15 women and 15 men); low-quality image on computer screen (N = 30; Mage = 21.4; 15 women and 15 men).

Before taking part in the experiment, all the participants completed questionnaires relating to anxiety and depression (HADS, Zigmond and Snaith, 1983), mood (PANAS, Watson et al., 1988) and their immersion tendency (ITQ, Witmer and Singer, 1998). A one-way ANOVA was conducted to compare anxiety (HADS-A), depression (HADS-D), positive affects (PANAS-PA), negative affects (PANAS-NA) and immersive tendencies (IT) between the four experimental groups. No significant difference was found.

3.2. Materials and stimuli
3.2.1. Apparatus
For the CS condition, we employed a 53 × 32-cm computer screen. The screen had a spatial resolution of 1680 × 1050 pixels and a refresh rate of 60 Hz. It was connected to a PC with IntelⓇ Core™ i8–7700HQ CPU with 2 × 3.60 GHz, DDR 4 2 × 32 GB RAM, and a GeforceⓇ GTX 1080, running Microsoft Windows 10.

For the HMD condition, we employed the HTC Vive headset, which has a spatial resolution of 1080 × 1200 pixels per eye and a refresh rate of 90 Hz. The HMD was connected to a PC with IntelⓇ Core™ i7–7700HQ CPU with 2 × 2.80 GHz, 8 GB RAM, and a GeforceⓇ GTX 1070, running Microsoft Windows 10.

For the two conditions the experience was created using the Unity cross-platform game engine and sounds were output through a Bose OE2i headset.

3.2.2. Stimuli
A set of 110 3D assets were pre-tested by 31 students (Mage = 24.9, range = 20–28, women N = 15, men N = 16) at Lyon 2 University. During this pre-test, the participants were asked to rate the level of arousal (−4 low arousal to +4 high arousal) and valence (−4 negative to +4 positive) based on the self-assessment manikin (SAM test, Bradley and Lang, 1994). The first and last third of the mean valence and arousal scores of all participants for each stimulus were taken as threshold values. For valence (Mean scores per stimulus: min = −3; max = 2.7), a mean score under −0.6 was considered as negative, a score between −0.6 and +1.3 as neutral, and a score over +1.3 as positive. For arousal (Mean scores per stimulus: min = −3.1; max = 2.9), a mean score under −2 was considered as low arousal, between −2 and 0.3 as medium, and over 0.3 as highly arousing.

Of the 110 3D assets, 58 were used as experimental stimuli and were split into 12 sets of stimuli, with the assets in any given emotional group having the same levels of arousal and valence (see Fig. 1). Of the 12 sets, 6 sets were used in an island virtual environment: 3 sets of high-arousal negative stimuli (2 sets of 5 and 1 set of 4) and 3 sets of neutral stimuli (2 sets of 5 and 1 set of 4). The other 6 sets of stimuli were displayed in a city virtual environment (2 sets of 5 medium-arousal negative stimuli, 2 sets of 5 neutral stimuli and 2 sets of 5 medium-arousal positive stimuli). Each of the 6 sets of stimuli in the island environment was displayed in one of six different places, and each of the 6 sets used in the city environment was also displayed in one of six different places. Wilcoxon tests were conducted and showed that: (1) sets of stimuli of the same emotional valence did not differ from one another in terms of valence and level of arousal, (2) sets of stimuli of different emotional valence differed in terms of valence and the emotional sets differed from the neutral sets in terms of arousal. Table 1 shows the respective mean scores for valence and arousal for each set of stimuli.

To manipulate image quality, we created a second, low-quality, version of the 58 3D models. To do so, we used the Autodesk Maya software to remove approximatively between 30 and 50% of the polygons of each 3D asset (in a way that still permitted recognition), while the poorest texture and a level of shade were chosen for assets and environments in the Unity editor.

3.3. Procedure
Regardless of the group in which they were included, the participants were asked to visit two VR destinations, a City and an Island, each containing 6 places (see Fig. 2). They could first choose which destination to see by selecting the corresponding map with the mouse (for the CS condition) or with the HTC Vive remote (for the HMD condition). They could then visit the 6 places indicated on the map in whichever order they preferred. When a place was selected, a dark screen was displayed briefly, and the location was then presented.

Fig. 2. Protocol for the presentation of the two virtual environments (City and Island) and the six different places in each environment. Bottom left, the presentation sequence for each stimulus in one virtual environment or place (e.g., the desert).

In each place, 4 or 5 stimuli with the same valence and level of arousal were displayed in a random order. On the island, 3 places contained negative stimuli with a high level of arousal (5 stimuli were displayed in 2 of the places and 4 were displayed in 1 of them), and 3 places contained neutral stimuli (5 stimuli were displayed in 2 of the places and 4 were displayed in 1 of them). In the city, 5 stimuli were displayed in each place: 2 places contained negative stimuli with a medium level of arousal, 2 other places contained positive stimuli with a medium level of arousal, while another 2 places contained neutral stimuli.

Irrespective of the place, the stimuli were always presented one at a time, approximately 1.5 m from the participants’ viewpoint, in front of the participant and slightly to his or her left or right. In the CS condition, the participants had to move the mouse from left to right to see the entire environment, whereas in the HMD condition they just had to move their heads. The presentation of each stimulus was preceded by the presentation of the environment for a period of 7 s. The spatialized sound was then emitted from the location of stimulus presentation and was immediately followed by the stimulus itself. This gradually appeared during a period of one second (starting as a small spot which got bigger until it reached its final size). The stimulus was then animated for 5 s before gradually disappearing again during a period of one second (getting smaller until it completely disappeared). After all 5 stimuli had been presented in each place, a white screen appeared. Several questions were then displayed on the screen one after another. To ensure they were understood correctly, the questions were also presented orally at the same time. The participants were first asked to rate, on a 9-point scale, the level of valence and arousal (SAM test, Bradley and Lang, 1994) of the virtual experience they had just viewed. This rating was followed by 3 other questions that were related to the sense of presence. The participants were asked to rate, on a 7-point Likert scale, their general sense of presence (How present did you feel in the environment?), their presence relative to the environment (How strong was your impression that you could visit the environment?), and their ability to touch things (How strong was your feeling that you could touch things?). The last two evaluations concerned, in order, attentional focus (How focused did you feel on the task you were asked to do?) and motivation (How motivated did you feel to do the task you were asked to do?).

The experiment stopped when the participant had seen all 6 places in the first destination. In the computer screen condition, the light was switched on and in the HMD condition, the HMD was removed. The participants then completed a French version of the ITC-SOPI questionnaire and were asked to recall as many stimuli as possible that they had seen in the destination (Island or City). The same procedure as described above was then repeated for the destination which had not been seen. For the record, 55.5% of the participants choose the Island first and 44.5% the City. In the CS condition, the participants sat on a comfortable chair in an experiment room with the lights off while they viewed the virtual environment at a distance of about 0.5 m between their eyes and the computer screen. In the HMD condition, the participants sat on a comfortable chair and the HMD was placed on their heads and was adjusted correctly.

3.4. Statistical analysis
The mean scores for correct free recall (item memory for virtual stimuli), sense of presence (score obtained by summing the scores of the five questions testing sense of presence), and emotional pleasantness and arousal (SAM test) were used for the statistical analysis. For more precise analysis of SoP, ANOVAs have been conducted on each of the five questions separately and have been reported in the Supplementary Material. The means were calculated for places presenting stimuli that induced the same emotion (Island – negative and neutral; City – positive, negative and neutral). The data were analyzed separately for the Island and City environments. Thus, the factorial design was 2 × 2 × 2 in the Island and 3 × 2 × 2 in the City, (emotion)x(device)x(quality) with emotion as within subjects factor and device and quality as between subjects factors. Preliminary analyses were performed to check for sphericity (Mauchly's test) and homogeneity of variances. When violations were found, corrected scores (Greenhouse-Geisser) were reported. First, we performed a mixed measures ANOVA including all data, with Emotion (Island – negative vs. neutral; City - positive vs. negative vs. neutral) as within-subject factor and Device (HMD vs. CS), and Quality of the 3D model (High Quality vs. Low Quality) as between-subject factors. Correlation and regression analyses were then performed separately for the HMD and the CS conditions on the scores per place (six in the City and six on the Island). Only significant effects were reported.

4. Results
4.1. Recall performances
4.1.1. Island
A significant effect of Emotion (F(1, 104) = 28.422, p< .001, partial ŋ2 = 0.215) was observed, with recall being higher for negative stimuli (M = 8.78, SE = 0.22) than for neutral ones (M = 7.35, SE = 0.21). The interaction between Emotion and Device (F(1, 104) = 8.448, p = .004, partial ŋ2 = 0.075) was also significant (see Fig. 3 left). The planned comparisons showed that in the HMD condition, negative stimuli (M = 9.26, SE = 0.26) were recalled better than neutral ones (M = 7.05, SE = 0.32, t(104) = 5.53, p< .001). However, this was not the case in the CS condition (negative: M = 8.32, SE = 0.31; neutral: M = 7.67, SE = 0.26). Furthermore, for both the negative and neutral stimuli, recall was not significantly different in the HMD and CS conditions (respectively, t(199) = 2.24, p = .116; t(199) = −1.42, p = .489).

4.1.2. City
A significant effect of Emotion was observed (F(2, 208) = 4.067, p = .019, partial ŋ2 = 0.038). The planned comparisons revealed that recall was higher for positive (M = 5.74, SE = 0.16) than for neutral stimuli (M = 5.13, SE = 0.17, t(208) = 2.784, p = .018). There was no significant difference between positive and negative stimuli (M = 5.56, SE = 0.16), or between negative and neutral stimuli (see Fig. 3 right).

4.2. Sense of presence – SoP
4.2.1. Island
A significant effect of Emotion was observed (F(1, 104) = 29.119, p< .001, partial ŋ2 = 0.219), with a higher SoP for the places with negative (M = 19.93, SE = 0.49) than neutral stimuli (M = 18.28, SE = 0.54). A significant effect of Device was also observed (F(1, 104) = 6.761, p = .011, partial ŋ2 = 0.061), with a higher SoP for the HMD (M = 20.38, SE = 0.73) than for the CS condition (M = 17.84, SE = 0.65).

4.2.2. City
A significant effect of Emotion was observed (F(2, 208) = 10.108, p< .001, partial ŋ2 = 0.089). The planned comparisons showed that SoP was higher for the places with positive (M = 19.36, SE = 0.54) than negative (M = 18.44, SE = 0.47, t(208) = 2.68, p = .023) and neutral stimuli (M = 17.82, SE = 0.51, t(208) = 4.47, p< .001). However, there were no significant differences between the places with negative and neutral stimuli. A significant effect of the Device was also observed (F(1, 104) = 18.852, p< .001, partial ŋ2 = 0.153), with higher SoP for the HMD condition (M = 20.57, SE = 0.70) than for the CS condition (M = 16.51, SE = 0.62).

4.3. Self-reported Valence
4.3.1. Island
A significant effect of Emotion was observed (F(1, 104) = 121.28, p< .001, partial ŋ2 = 0.538), with self-reported Valence being lower for the places with negative (M = −0.54, SE = 0.16) than neutral stimuli (M = 1.19, SE = 0.11). A significant effect of Quality of the 3D model was also observed (F(1, 104) = 4.14, p = .045, partial ŋ2 = 0.038), with higher self-reported valence for the Low Quality (M = 0.54, SE = 0.15) than for the High Quality condition (M = 0.12, SE = 0.17). The interaction between Emotion and Device (F(1, 104) = 9.26, p = .003, partial ŋ2 = 0.082), and between Emotion and Quality of the 3D model (F(1, 104) = 12.69, p< .001, partial ŋ2 = 0.109) was significant. More interestingly, the interaction between Emotion, Device and Quality of the 3D model was also significant (F(1, 104) = 817.90, p< .001, partial ŋ2 = 0.147) (see Fig. 4).

To enable us to gain a better understanding of this interaction, the data were analyzed separately for HMD and CS. In the HMD condition, the effect of Emotion was significant (F(1, 46) = 36.2, p< .001, partial ŋ2 = 0.440). However, and most interestingly, the interaction between Emotion and Quality of the 3D model was also significant (F(1, 46) = 34.6, p< .001, partial ŋ2= 0.429). The planned comparisons showed that in the High Quality condition, self-reported valence was higher for the places with neutral (M = 1.49, SE = 0.17) than negative stimuli (M = −1, SE = 0.33, t(46) = 8.41, p< .001), whereas no significant difference was observed in the Low Quality condition (neutral (M = 0.65, SE = 0.24; negative (M = 0.62, SE = 0.23)). Moreover, for the places with negative stimuli, self-reported Valence was higher for the Low Quality condition than the High Quality condition (t(84.2) = 4.58, p< .001), whereas this was not the case for the places with neutral stimuli. In the CS condition, only a significant effect of Emotion was observed (F(1, 58) = 95.31, p< .001, partial ŋ2 = 0.622), with self-reported valence being lower for the places with negative (M = −0.87, SE = 0.21) than neutral stimuli (M = 1.34, SE = 0.15).

4.3.2. City
A significant effect of Emotion was observed (F(2, 174.54) = 103.50, p< .001, partial ŋ2 = 0.499). The planned comparisons showed a significantly lower self-reported Valence for the places with negative (M = −0.68, SE = 0.14) than neutral (M = 0.69, SE = 0.32) or positive stimuli (M = 1.57, SE = 0.31), and a lower score for the places with neutral than positive stimuli (respectively, t(208) = −8.66, p< .001, t(208) = −14.28, p< .001 and t(208) = −5.62, p< .001). The interactions between Emotion and Device (F(2, 174.54) = 11.46, p< .001, partial ŋ2 = 0.099), and between Emotion and Quality of the 3D model (F(2, 174.54) = 9.71, p< .001, partial ŋ2 = 0.085) were significant. More importantly, the interaction between Emotion, Device and Quality of the 3D model was also significant (F(2, 174.54) = 5.11, p = .010, partial ŋ2 = 0.047) (see Fig. 5).

To allow us to gain a better understanding of this interaction, the data were analyzed separately for HMD and CS. In the HMD condition, a significant effect of Emotion (F(2, 92) = 20.1, p< .001, partial ŋ2 = 0.304) and a significant interaction between Emotion and Quality of the 3D model were observed (F(2, 92) = 12, p< .001, partial ŋ2 = 0.207). The planned comparisons showed that for the High Quality condition, self-reported valence was higher for the places with neutral (M = 0.79, SE = 0.17) than negative stimuli (M = −0.52, SE = 0.37, t(92) = 4, p = .002) and lower for the former than for the places with positive stimuli (M = 2.08, SE = 0.21, t(92) = −3.94, p = .002). Self-reported valence was also higher for the places with positive than negative stimuli (t(92) = 7.94, p< .001). No significant differences were observed in the Low Quality condition (neutral (M = 0.44, SE = 0.32); negative (M = 0.15, SE = 0.20); positive (M = 0.48, SE = 0.29)). Moreover, for the positive condition, self-reported valence was higher for the High Quality condition than the Low Quality condition (t(121.4) = 4.20, p< .001) but not for the places with neutral or negative stimuli. In the CS condition, a significant effect of Emotion was observed (F(2, 80.12) = 106.90, p< .001, partial ŋ2 = 0.648), with self-reported valence being lower for the places with negative (M = −1.08, SE = 0.16) than neutral (M = 0.76, SE = 0.13; t(116) = −9.21, p< .001) or positive stimuli (M = 1.80, SE = 0.17, t(116) = −14.44, p< .001), and higher for the places with positive than neutral stimuli (t(116) = 5.23, p< .001).

A significant effect of Emotion was observed (F(1, 104) = 155.17, p< .001, partial ŋ2 = 0.599) with self-reported Arousal being higher for the places with negative (M = 0.71, SE = 0.17) than the neutral stimuli (M = −0.96, SE = 0.18). The interaction between Emotion and Device was significant (F(1, 104) = 20.65, p< .001, partial ŋ2 = 0.166) (see Fig. 6 left). The planned comparisons showed that for the HMD and the CS conditions, self-reported Arousal was higher for the places with negative (HMD condition - M = 0.50, SE = 0.25; CS condition - M = 0.92, SE = 0.24) than neutral stimuli (HMD condition - M = −0.57, SE = 0.26, t(104) = 5.31, p< .001; CS condition - M = −1.36, SE = 0.24, t(104) = 12.65, p< .001). The interaction between Emotion and Quality of the 3D model was also significant (F(1, 104) = 8.93, p = .003, partial ŋ2= 0.079) (see Fig. 6right). The planned comparisons showed that for the High Quality and Low Quality conditions, self-reported Arousal was higher for the places with negative (High Quality condition - M = 1.18, SE = 0.19; Low Quality condition - M = 0.24, SE = 0.27) than neutral stimuli (High Quality condition - M = −0.89, SE = 0.24, t(104) = 10.92, p< .001; Low Quality condition - M = −1.03, SE = 0.27, t(104) = 6.70, p< .001).

The effect of Quality of the 3D model was also significant (F(1, 104) = 25.36, p< .001, partial ŋ2 = 0.196), with self-reported arousal being higher in the Low (M = −0.67, SE = 0.17) than the High Quality condition (M = −1.12, SE = 0.15). The interaction between Emotion and Device (F(2, 208) = 16.36, p< .001, partial ŋ2 = 0.136) and that between Emotion and Quality of the 3D model (F(2, 208) = 7.52, p< .001, partial ŋ2 = 0.067) were significant. More importantly, the interaction between Emotion, Device and Quality of the 3D model (F(2, 208) = 3.36,p = .037, partial ŋ2 = 0.031) was significant (see Fig. 7). To enable a better understanding of this interaction, the data were analyzed separately for HMD and CS.

5. Discussion
The main goal of the present study was to investigate the respective influence of immersion and sense of presence (SoP) on the episodic memory of neutral and emotional stimuli experienced in a virtual environment. We manipulated immersion by using two displays (HMD versus CS) and two levels of visual fidelity (high-quality 3D model versus low-quality). Emotion was manipulated by presenting positive, negative (both medium arousal) and neutral stimuli in City environments and negative (high arousal) and neutral stimuli in Island environments. We predicted that the high-immersion condition (high-quality 3D model displayed on HMD) would generate a greater SoP and emotional experience and better memory performance, especially for emotional stimuli, than the low-immersion condition (low-quality 3D model displayed on CS). We also speculated that the display would have a greater impact than the quality of the 3D model on SoP, emotional experience and memory performance. In order to be able to interpret the effects of sense of presence, arousal and valence on memory performance, we will first discuss the results concerning these factors, and then results related to memory performance.

5.1. Impact of immersion and emotion on sense of presence
In the present study, we evaluated the sense of presence several times during a virtual experience in Island and City environments. A short questionnaire including five questions was administrated after each of the six places visited in the two environments. Our prediction was that the sense of presence (total score of the five question) would be higher when VE was experienced with high than with low immersive device (HMD versus CS) and higher with high than low quality of the 3D models. In addition, the SoP should be higher for emotional than neutral environments.

As expected, SoP was higher for the HMD than for the CS condition. This suggests that a highly immersive device elicits a greater SoP than a weakly immersive device. This result could be an empirical argument in favor of the definition of presence in terms of the subjective feeling that results from immersion (Slater, 2003). However, SoP was not affected by the quality of the 3D model. These results suggest that the element of immersion resulting from visual fidelity does not impact the sense of presence to the same extent as the device type does. In fact, several components of immersion are dependent on the type of device (e.g., first person view, head tracking to explore the environment instead of mouse tracking for the CS). To be more specific, an HMD provides more natural sensorial, motor and sensorimotor interfaces than a CS (Fuchs, 2018). As an example, the visual interface with an HMD provides an image of the VE across the entire field of view. With a CS, the VE only partially occupies the user's field of view. By contrast, the quality of the 3D model concerns almost exclusively visual aspects (polygon numbers, shades, colors and texture). However, it is also possible that the changes we introduced in terms of the visual fidelity of the 3D model were not enough to influence the sense of presence in our study.

Concerning the effect of emotions on the sense of presence, our results suggest, like previous studies, that an emotional experience in a virtual reality environment induces a greater sense of presence than a neutral one (e.g., Riva et al., 2007). However, the separate analysis of each component of presence (i.e., the five question composing our presence evaluation), indicates that the influence of emotion on sense of presence might be more crucial with a weakly immersive device than with a highly immersive one (see results on Supplementary Material). Thus, these results provide further support for the evidence suggesting that emotion and presence are strongly linked to each other.

5.2. Impact of immersion on emotion
In the present study, we manipulated emotion by including negative, positive and neutral stimuli (one kind of stimulus in each place) in places related to two environments, the Island and the City. We expected that the fact that each place contained stimuli of specific emotional valence would impact participants’ emotional experience of each place (e.g., places with negative stimuli would create a negative emotional experience), and that this experience could be modulated by the type of device and 3D model quality. Except in the HMD/low-quality 3D model condition, in which all the places (whether with negative, positive or neutral stimuli) were evaluated as neutral and as being of medium arousal, the participants evaluated their emotional experience in a way that was congruent with the valence and arousal value of the stimuli displayed in the environment. Interestingly, using a low-quality 3D model neutralized emotional valence in the more immersive condition (HMD). Taken together, these results on self-reported valence and arousal show that immersion, manipulated by the device and the 3D model quality, impacts the emotional experience of VR users. Surprisingly, an impact of the 3D model quality was found only in the HMD condition. This suggests that in the case of more immersive devices, emotions are more likely to be disturbed by poor visual fidelity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such an effect has been shown.

5.3. Impact of immersion on memory
Contrary to our predictions, we did not generally observe significant effects of the device and the quality of the 3D model on memory performance. Surprisingly, even if an HMD brought about better sensorimotor immersion (field of regard, head tracking, hand tracking, stereoscopy) and a first-person view experience that should have enhanced recall (Bréchet et al., 2019), recall performance was equally good in the HMD and CS condition, in which immersion was poorer. What is more, recall was equally good in the high-quality 3D model condition as in the low-quality 3D model condition. Moreover, these two factors did not interact. Thus, our results suggest that the level of immersion, defined as the objective capacity of the technology to deliver sensorial stimulations, has little impact on the memory of virtual experiences. This finding runs contrary to certain evidence coming from other studies suggesting that higher immersion should increase memory performance (see Smith, 2019, for a review). One explanation for our results might be, as Makowski et al. (2017) suggested, that memory for virtual experience is mediated by another factor: sense of presence. Moreover, studies have shown that immersion is linked to the sense of presence (Baños et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2002). Thus, it is possible that in our study, instead of directly impacting memory, the level of immersion impacted the sense of presence which then, in turn, impacts memory. We will develop this point later in the discussion. On the other hand, Bowman and McMahan (2007) suggested that immersion is a multi-component phenomenon, and thus depends on several factors (e.g., field of regard, display size, realism of lighting, frame rate, head tracking, stereoscopy) that, in turn, can have different impacts on cognitive functions. For example, in their studies, Narayan et al. (2005) showed that stereoscopy (displaying a different image to each eye to allow depth of vision) increased speed and reduced errors in a collaborative object manipulation task, whereas adding head tracking had no effect. Based on this last experiment, in particular, Bowman and McMahan (2007) argued that full immersion is not always needed to perform a task in VR. Our results are compatible with this suggestion and provide further details about memory functioning in VR, which does not appear to be highly dependent simply on the capacity of the technology to deliver sensorial stimulation, and especially in a case where this stimulation is essentially unimodal (e.g., visual), as in our study.

5.4. Impact of interaction between immersion and emotion on memory performance
In line with a large body of literature on the effect of emotion on memory (e.g., Kensinger and Schacter, 2008; Roozendaal and McGaugh, 2011), we expected memory performance to be generally better for emotional stimuli than for neutral stimuli, and hypothesized that the emotional enhancement of memory (EEM) would be larger for a more immersive virtual experience than for a less immersive virtual experience. The results only partly confirm our expectations, as heterogeneous effects were observed in the Island and City environments. Contrary to our predictions, EEM was not observed in all the experimental conditions. In fact, on the one hand, in the Island environment, EEM was observed with HMD but not with CS and, on the other, it was observed for positive but not negative stimuli with both HMD and CS in the City environment. In addition, we did not observe any modulation of EEM by the quality of the 3D model, as no significant main effect or interaction of this factor with other factors were observed.

These discrepant results are quite difficult to explain. It is possible that the fact that EEM was observed only for positive stimuli in the City environment is an experimental artefact. Indeed, the differences in memory performances were very slight between positive and neutral (0.61) and between negative and neutral stimuli (0.43). Thus, EEM for the City environment was either small or non-existent. However, the fact that the effect was observed in different participants in both the HMD and CS condition argues against this conclusion. It therefore seems that although the effect is small, it is nevertheless consistent. Concerning the results observed in the Island environment, they suggest that an increase in immersion induces the difference in memory performance between highly arousing negative stimuli and neutral ones. Taking these results together, one explanation could be that immersion has different impacts in memory for negative highly arousing, negative and positive moderately arousing, and neutral stimuli. Further studies are necessary to investigate this possibility.

Another explanation for our results might be the fact that immersion possibly also impacts the factors that are responsible for EEM. Some authors have proposed that EEM is mediated by several factors, such as attention, distinctiveness and organization (Talmi, 2013). Distinctiveness is the fact that an isolated stimulus appears more distinctively among other stimuli that are related to each other. The stimuli used in the HMD and CS conditions in our study were the same and were presented in blocks (sets of 5 or 4 stimuli) of equivalent arousal and valence. Organization is defined by the relation between stimuli of the same sets. For example, negative stimuli are related to each other by the fact that they are negative or belong to the same semantic category (e.g., food). In our study, organization was the same for the HMD and the CS condition. The absence of EEM in the CS condition seems to be consistent with Talmi's (2013) results. However, in the HMD condition, EEM was still observed even when organization and distinctiveness were controlled for. One might suggest that using an HMD impacts factors that are involved in EEM in a different way from when a CS is used. For example, higher immersion could enhance distinctiveness, decrease organization or increase attention. This suggestion needs to be investigated further given that we did not observe any difference in EEM between the HMD and CS condition in the City environment. Surprisingly, in this environment, EEM was observed with both HMD and CS, but only for positive stimuli. It is possible that organization was less controlled in the city than in the island environment. Indeed, all the stimuli in the island environment were related to wildlife (mostly animals), whereas in the city, the stimuli belonged to multiple semantic categories (e.g., food, city infrastructure, animals, insects). Thus, globally, organization was less controlled in the city than in the island environment. Moreover, the positive stimuli were more often animated than the neutral and negative stimuli. It is possible that animated stimuli (e.g.; dog) are more distinctive than motionless ones (e.g.; ice cream).

5.5. Impact of sense of presence and emotional experience on memory performance
In order to understand which factors best explained memory performance, we conducted regression analysis including the scores for the subjective evaluation of valence, arousal, and five aspects of the sense of presence. Our results showed that in the HMD and CS conditions, all the predictors were strongly correlated with each other. This implies that interpretations of our regression analyses should be treated with caution.

The regression analysis showed a significant but weak relation between memory and valence in the HMD condition, and between memory and both motivation and SoP-G in the CS condition for the Island environment; and only between memory and focus in the HMD condition for the City environment. Globally, these results suggest that memory performances for virtual stimuli are explained, at least partially, by factors involved in the sense of presence (SoP-G, focus, motivation). This corroborates previous findings which have suggested that greater presence is linked to better memory performances (e.g.,Sutcliffe et al., 2005). Moreover, our results show that emotional experience (valence) also seems to play a role in memory performances. These findings are consistent with Makowski et al. (2017) results, which describe strong correlations between presence, emotion and memory. Although we observed that some part of the variance in memory performances was explained by a global sense of presence (i.e., the evaluation of presence in the virtual environment), this amounted to less than 4% of variance. It is therefore possible that other factors that we did not measure directly impact the link between emotion and memory in VR. Because of its important role in presence (Makowski et al., 2017) and memory (Talmi et al., 2007), this factor could be attention. Attentional focus was assessed by only a single question answered after a visit to each virtual place. Although this provides useful global information about the subjective quantity of attention engaged during the VE, it is nevertheless a rather coarse measure. In future studies and in order to assess attention toward the stimuli during the task, online and objective measures (e.g.; ocular fixation time on the stimulus) should be undertaken.

6. Conclusion and limitations
In the present study, we revealed several potentially interesting results: (1) both immersion and emotion had an impact on memory; (2) unlike the device type, the quality of the 3D model had no impact on memory performance; (3) emotion and device type, but not the quality of the 3D model, increased the sense of presence. These observations might be useful for future developments of VR in the field of knowledge acquisition (e.g., professional training, academic education). Unfortunately, in our study, we only measured memory after a short period of time (a few minutes, i.e. immediate long-term memory). Thus, to apply the findings to practical cases, new studies will be needed in which memory is measured after longer periods of time. In addition, all our measures of sense of presence and emotional experience were subjective. Thus, in a future study, it might be interesting to add physiological measures of emotion and presence, such as heart rate or pupil diameter. The fact that we used the faster GPU (GTX 1080) for the CS condition but not for the HMD condition, because of practical issues, could constitute another limitation. Finally, as we have pointed out, memory might be influenced by factors that were not measured in our study, such as attention. It therefore seems necessary for future studies to include objective measures of attention, such as gaze fixation and eye movements.
