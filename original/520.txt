Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become an essential and important supporting technology for smart Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems. Due to the high computational costs of large-scale DNNs, it might be infeasible to directly deploy them in energy-constrained IoT devices. Through offloading computation-intensive tasks to the cloud or edges, the computation offloading technology offers a feasible solution to execute DNNs. However, energy-efficient offloading for DNN based smart IoT systems with deadline constraints in the cloud-edge environments is still an open challenge. To address this challenge, we first design a new system energy consumption model, which takes into account the runtime, switching, and computing energy consumption of all participating servers (from both the cloud and edge) and IoT devices. Next, a novel energy-efficient offloading strategy based on a Self-adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm using the Genetic Algorithm operators (SPSO-GA) is proposed. This new strategy can efficiently make offloading decisions for DNN layers with layer partition operations, which can lessen the encoding dimension and improve the execution time of SPSO-GA. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to other classic methods.
