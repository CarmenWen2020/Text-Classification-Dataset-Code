Rapid communication of viral sicknesses is an arising public medical issue across the globe. Out of these, COVID-19 is viewed as the most critical and novel infection nowadays. The current investigation gives an effective framework for the monitoring and prediction of COVID-19 virus infection (C-19VI). To the best of our knowledge, no research work is focused on incorporating IoT technology for C-19 outspread over spatial–temporal patterns. Moreover, limited work has been done in the direction of prediction of C-19 in humans for controlling the spread of COVID-19. The proposed framework includes a four-level architecture for the expectation and avoidance of COVID-19 contamination. The presented model comprises COVID-19 Data Collection (C-19DC) level, COVID-19 Information Classification (C-19IC) level, COVID-19-Mining and Extraction (C-19ME) level, and COVID-19 Prediction and Decision Modeling (C-19PDM) level. Specifically, the presented model is used to empower a person/community to intermittently screen COVID-19 Fever Measure (C-19FM) and forecast it so that proactive measures are taken in advance. Additionally, for prescient purposes, the probabilistic examination of C-19VI is quantified as degree of membership, which is cumulatively characterized as a COVID-19 Fever Measure (C-19FM). Moreover, the prediction is realized utilizing the temporal recurrent neural network. Additionally, based on the self-organized mapping technique, the presence of C-19VI is determined over a geographical area. Simulation is performed over four challenging datasets. In contrast to other strategies, altogether improved outcomes in terms of classification efficiency, prediction viability, and reliability were registered for the introduced model.

With the headway in innovation, the medical care industry has extensive significance in the everyday life of human beings [1]. Nonetheless, the significant difficulties for medical care administrations are to gather exact information and give a better nature of administrations in an ongoing environment [2]. Recently, the episode of COVID-19 (coronavirus) has been perceived worldwide as a significant medical problem brought about by viral contamination that straightforwardly influences the different organs of the body [3]. Notwithstanding, strong well-being checking and control framework is required, particularly in those spots where the spread of COVID-19 is extensive [4]. Around the world, such sort of illness is a major test for healthcare agencies to control in real time. With the fast development of IoT innovations, smart sensors can be embedded at any place and anytime [5]. The forthcoming inescapable technological revolution and the fast development of innovation make efficient healthcare applications possible [6]. COVID-19 is a novel illness bringing about expanded dreariness and death rate. Early indications incorporate fever, cough, and headache, along with unexpected oxygen saturation [5]. Concurring to the studies, 40% to 60% of COVID-19 strains are unexplained, which is a significant constraint for the medical service industry [7]. Prior, old innovations could not screen and recognize the infection spread precisely [8]. Development including fog and cloud computing, and IoT embedded frameworks have picked up significance because of humongous handling power, enormous capacity limit, and impression of effective and precise information [9]. Moreover, the trio-logical computing model is relevant in the medical care framework for crisis estimation, improving sound living at less expense, and observing the distant site which is inaccessible so that safety measures can be taken in real time. Notwithstanding the points of interest of the introduced model, information mining procedures for data assessment and analysis improve medical care administration quality by empowering viable choices. The IoT–cloud–fog computing innovation has been effectively embraced by various medical care industries to accomplish certain errands, for example, medical care checking and conveyance of results with insignificant time delay. The new headways in fog–cloud-based innovation have roused to plan of the proposed system. Specifically, in the fog layer, fog hubs get the well-being information from various sensors and IoT-driven gadgets that are associated with a few pre-arranged devices for handling persistent information and conveying results to the user in real time. Some of the important fog computing devices are depicted in Fig. 1. With the ubiquity of versatile innovation, the proposed model determines the illness in the beginning phase and produces a prompt message to the end client by employing a cell phone for crisis management.

Proposed model
Figure 2 shows an overview of the C-19VI monitoring framework’s proposed model. The framework proposed comprises four levels, specifically the COVID-19 Data Collection (C-19DC), COVID-19 Information Classification (C-19IC), COVID-19 Mining and Extraction (C-19ME), and COVID-19 Prediction Decision Modeling (C-19PDM). Each level is intended to achieve specific objectives to accomplish a definitive target of C-19VI prediction.

COVID-19 data collection (C-19DC)
The underlying layer is focused to gather patient’s well-being-related information acquired progressively from the different sensors including health sensors, ecological sensors, meteorological sensors, and geographical sensors. The procured data perceived from different gadgets is communicated to the intelligent device which is considered a fog hub and is responsible for information analysis. Moreover, it is sent for pre-preparing and investigation to the associate COVID-19 illness over the geographical location. Notwithstanding information collection, the protection and security of IoT devices are additionally targeted. For this reason, vital protocols are used for security to the information productively. All the data to and from IoT gadgets require information security, for example, secure socket layer (SSL) convention and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) calculation. These conventions guarantee secure correspondence over HTTP and message query telemetry protocol (MQTP). Furthermore, with a user-friendly API, the IoT framework can be transformed to a product-level stage. Amazon Web Services (AWS) for the IoT model permits analyzing information with high precision and adequacy. Other than Amazon, Apple and Google additionally give security to unapproved access. For real-time handling, all information esteems are prepared at the fog layer for time-delicate alerts and caution about a contaminated user if any symptoms are distinguished.

COVID-19 information classification (C-19IC)
After the collection of the heterogeneous information from various sensor gadgets, it is important to detail this information into different classes that are identified with health well-being. Because of the heterogeneity of information, classification strategies are to be applied for better characterizations. Figure 3 portrays the well-being information classification. The four informational collections are classified as follows:

1.
Health data This sort of information collection contains crucial indications including high fever, vomiting, nausea, saturation, and headache. Different well-being-related clinical sensors are utilized to gather such sort of information.

2.
Meteorological data This informational index contains environment-based information such as pressure, moistness, most extreme, and least temperature. Different sensors are set in various areas for procuring such data.

3.
Location data It decides the area of irresistible locales that are COVID-19 inclined. Different GPS empowered sensors are embedded in geo-locations in various regions.

4.
Environmental data Water quality, diet, Level of supplements, air contamination, and other factors can be estimated persistently which influences human well-being. IoT gadgets such as temperature sensors and other smart gadgets are utilized for such kind of information procurement.

Moreover, such events play an important role in diagnosing COVID-19 for personal health directly or indirectly.

COVID-19 data mining and extraction (C-19ME): fog layer
To decide the COVID-19-related vulnerability, an information examination of data is required. For this reason, fog processing hubs are utilized to examine the heterogeneous information from various boundaries at different time allotments at respective geo-locations areas. In this way, the fog layer acts as an interface between IoT gadgets such as cell phones and the distributed computing cloud layer. To analyze the COVID-19-related well-being condition of a user, the fog layer utilizes the Health State ID part.

Health state identification
To decide the well-being status of an individual, characterization performs a significant job that orders comparative information in a similar class and disparate into another class. This separates information into two classes as non-infected and infected class based on COVID-19 data. Classification is a typical strategy for measurable information investigation. By utilizing a fuzzy C-means (FCM) procedure, data can be arranged in at least 1 class with a certain degree of membership (DOM) grade with the range from 0 and 1. FCM utilizes an efficient procedure that limits the error while assessing the informational index. FCM identifies centroids until it does not change with time. The FCM classifier is the likelihood used to arrange the classes specifically termed Class-1 and Class-2. The arrangement is characterized ahead.

1.
Infected data class This class incorporates those information esteems whose DOM is low and distant to centroids. It implies its likelihood to lie in the main (Class-1) classification. Those information esteems are just utilized for COVID-19 observing purposes.

2.
Infected disease class It incorporates those information esteems whose DOM is high and near centroids, which lies in the subsequent group (Class-2) classification. These users require quick treatment or prudent to control the COVID-19 spread and get an alarm message.

Mathematical analyzation
A set of ten data points denoted D=\{f_{1},f_{2},\ldots .f_{10}𝐷={𝑓1,𝑓2,….𝑓10} where these data points \ f_{1},f_{2},f_{3},f_{4},f_{5},f_{6},f_{7},f_{8},f_{9},f_{10}\  𝑓1,𝑓2,𝑓3,𝑓4,𝑓5,𝑓6,𝑓7,𝑓8,𝑓9,𝑓10  are shown in Table 2.

If U_{ij}𝑈𝑖𝑗 indicates DOM of f_{j}𝑓𝑗 in ith cluster between 0 and 1, m is any real value greater than 1 that controls the fuzziness of partition (here m=2), f_{j}𝑓𝑗 defines jth data point, c_{i}𝑐𝑖 is centroid of fuzzy cluster, ||f_{j}-c_{i}||||𝑓𝑗−𝑐𝑖|| is Euclidean distance between data point and centroid, and N is number of clusters. The membership function is defined as (Table 3):

\begin{aligned} J_{m}(U,D) = \sum \limits _{j=1}^N \sum \limits _{i=1}^n U_{ij} ^{m}||f_{j} - c_{i}||^{2}. \end{aligned}

𝐽𝑚(𝑈,𝐷)=∑𝑗=1𝑁∑𝑖=1𝑛𝑈𝑚𝑖𝑗||𝑓𝑗−𝑐𝑖||2.

The summation of degree of membership of a data point to all cluster is equal to 1, i.e.,

\begin{aligned} \sum \limits _{i=1}^N U_{ij}=1 \end{aligned}.

∑𝑖=1𝑁𝑈𝑖𝑗=1.

It is also possible to submit examination information and reports to be processed in the cloud by the fog computing layer. By using spatio-transient information mining that separates information estimates from different users, it will lead to efficient investigation of information from distributed storage. Each of these qualities is separated by technique termed as space–time sequence patterns (STSP). As depicted ahead, spatial-transient mining is used as STSP.

Time–space-based data mining
Fog computing is a real-time distribution of a collaborative approach to information in which heterogeneous sensors are subscribed by spatial–temporal function to aggregate information for different activities [16]. The efficiency of a system can be improved by early assessment of the likelihood of an outbreak spread, including both spatial and temporal aspects.

a) Spatial data pattern

Let Z = \{z1,z2,\ldots , zn\}𝑍={𝑧1,𝑧2,…,𝑧𝑛} be the list of various events. An event ei is denoted as zi= (xi , yi , ti)𝑧𝑖=(𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑖,𝑡𝑖) at any time t in the region space x, y \forall i=1,2,\ldots ,n𝑥,𝑦∀𝑖=1,2,…,𝑛. The data is an occurrence sequence. In space and time of occurrence, each event is defined by its location. The various datasets are used to classify disease outbreaks within the region at different timestamps. A set of events is expressed as at the time interval t Z ^{_{T}} _{temporal} = \{zi = (xi , yi , ti)| ti \in T, i = 1, 2,\ldots , n \}𝑍𝑇𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑙={𝑧𝑖=(𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑖,𝑡𝑖)|𝑡𝑖∈𝑇,𝑖=1,2,…,𝑛}. Under real-time condition, t^{*}𝑡∗ represent the current time and Z^{i}𝑍𝑖(t^{*})𝑡∗), t^{*} \ge t𝑡∗≥𝑡, the status of event at point in time t in region R_{s,t}𝑅𝑠,𝑡 where s = \{x_{i},y_{i}\} \forall i.𝑠={𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑖}∀𝑖. An event \phi (z_{j},r_{j},t_{j})𝜙(𝑧𝑗,𝑟𝑗,𝑡𝑗) occurs at jth time–spatial coordinates (x, y) such that z_{j} \in Z ,t_{j} \in [t,t+ \triangle t]𝑧𝑗∈𝑍,𝑡𝑗∈[𝑡,𝑡+△𝑡] time stamp.

b) Time-based Data Mining One of the essential tasks in the fog layer is spatio-temporal (ST)-based prediction [17]. Place becomes the primary basis for storing the data value of an occurrence in time in the ST dependent method. Via a spatio-temporal granulation associated with it, the manifestation of an occurrence is noted by a specific collection of space–time locations and characteristics that changed at a specific time (daily or weekly or monthly) with respect to granule history [2].

Definition 1
(Space–Time Pattern) Time lags are used for the f_{i} \in Z_{si,ti}𝑓𝑖∈𝑍𝑠𝑖,𝑡𝑖 data value and are defined as the set of n events in a given region at the time window \triangle t such that [(Z_{ri}, t_{1}), (Z_{ri}, t_{2}),\ldots,(Z_{ri}, t_{n})] \forall i=1,2,\ldots ,n in a particular region. The extraction of STSP data makes data segments along with spatial and temporal connections [18]. The approach adopted for extracting spatio-temporal data is called spatio-temporal granularity [19].

Definition 2
(Spatio-temporal data granularity) A spatio-temporary granularity consists of a temporal granularity(G_{T}) and a spatial evolution(G_{T}) over the G T temporal domain: G_{ZT} = G_{T}, Z>. Data abstraction attributes in a given time window \trianglet from start to end are represented as:<\,G{{s_{i}},Z {j}>} \forall {i=1,2,3,\ldots } for a given STSP and k event dependent data abstraction attributes in a given time window with i=1,\ldots , m and j=1,2,\ldots ,k where d i represents the data value ith of the k time window case \trianglet. In Fig. 4, spatio-temporal granularity is shown.

As cases of the knowledge sets, spatio-temporal related data retrieved from various occasions are put away. The clinical expert analyzes the clinical knowledge of the users in a clinical setting and determines the probability of COVID-19 discovery. To analyze the COVID-19, the determination strategy consolidates into the proposed framework to produce well-being results with vulnerability estimates. Moreover, the COVID-19 Fever Measure (C-19FM) determines accurate vulnerability for the patient to be infected with COVID-19 in the given geo-location. The probabilities of the symptoms can be customized by the domain expert. Based on the value of C-19FM, if the vulnerability is high, an alert message is transmitted to the healthcare professional in real time.

COVID-19 prediction decision modeling (C-19PDM)
C-19PDM focuses on the prediction of vulnerability over spatial–temporal mining, dependent on the healthcare conditions of the patient. For this reason, the proposed model incorporates the temporal recurrent neural network (T-RNN) approach for the estimating expectation of the COVID-19 measure in the specific temporal instance. T-RNN is advance artificial intelligence (AAI) model that involves interconnected neurons with the back-propagation mechanism. An instance of T-RNN is depicted in Fig. 5. The significant goal of the T-RNN model is to confine the outcome with maximal accuracy by updating weights of the neighboring neurons appropriately.

Fig. 5
figure 5
Temporal recurrent network model

Temporal recurrent neural network (T-RNN) architecture
T-RNN contains the input layer, recurrent hidden layer, and output layer resulting in three interconnected layers. The input layer has n units based on the number of predictive parameters given. It takes the form of time-based data vectors such as (z(t-1), z(t), z(t+1)) where z(t)=(z_{1}, z_{2},...,z_{n}) is used. The completely interconnected input neurons are connected to the RNN network’s hidden units, where the weight matrix characterizes the interconnectors. The hidden layer consists of H hidden units of m_{t} = (m_{1}, m_{2},\ldots , m_{H}) linked with repeated relations over the temporal scale. Small, nonzero elements are the initial values of the hidden units to increase the overall efficiency of the RNN network. In addition, the hidden layer describes the state space of the whole predictive engine of the proposed model as being H_{t}=f_{i}(y_{t}), y_{}), if y_{t}=W_{IH}x_{t}+W_{HH}h_{t-1}+b_{h}. F_{i}(.) is the hidden layer activation function, and b_{h} is the hidden unit bias vector. Hidden units are further attached to the output layer with corresponding W_{HO} weight connections. Based on the estimation parameters, the output layer Y has several units. Output is measured as Y_{t}=f_{o}(W_{HO}h_{t}+b_{o}), where the activation function for the output layer is f_{o}(.). Since the presented model is temporally evaluated, the above steps are replicated over consecutive instances of t_{1}, t_{2},\ldots ,t_{n}. This shows that nonlinear state equations, which are recursive over the temporal scale, compose the RNN. In each instance of time, at the output layer, the hidden states provide a prediction test. The hidden states provide interconnected data to describe the network’s potential actions and make accurate predictions. In every case, it integrates the nonlinear activation function. In addition, if trained at all times, it is capable of modeling the rich complexities of health and environmental data.

1.
Learning Procedure Activation features are used to produce the input to the hidden layer and the output layer from the hidden layer. In addition to linear functions, nonlinear activation functions are stronger. In the learning procedure of the presented model, the nonlinearity in successive hidden layers in an RNN occurs. In the proposed model, because of its highest precision, the sigmoid function has been implemented. The sigmoid function is defined as

\begin{aligned} f(X) = \frac{\mathrm {1} }{\mathrm {1} + e^-d }. \end{aligned}

(3)

Using the back-propagation through time (BPTT) technique for minimizing the total propagation of error, the weight correction function for the intermediate hidden layers of RNN is achieved. Data segments are entered by BPTT in the form of a time series (x_{1}, t_{1}), (x_{2}, t_{2}),..., (x_{n}, t_{n}) and are assigned weights (w_{1}), (w_{2}),\ldots ,(w_{n}). In other words, for feed-forward networks, BPTT represents the generalization of back-propagation. The general BPTT method for learning RNNs maps the network in time and propagates time-scale error signals backward. BPTT leads to the generation of reliable findings over time. In other words, BPTT ensures improvement over time, i.e., the error produced at t-1 for x(t-1) disappears during the t+1 time stage. The BPTT law for altering weight is formalized as:

\begin{aligned} \Delta w = - \eta \frac{\partial C(w)}{\partial w} \end{aligned}

(4)

where C(\omega) denotes the incurred cost function for error rate estimation, \frac{\partial C(w)}{\partial w} denotes the cost function partial directive for error rate minimization and \eta denotes the learning rate for the model presented. The model’s training is replicated on a timescale until the minimum error rate is reached. The hidden layer of the suggested model uses the transfer function of tanh(x), which can be expressed as:

\begin{aligned} {\beta }_1\left( x,t\right) =tanh\left( x,t\right) =\ \frac{2}{1+e^{-2(x,t)}}-1. \end{aligned}

(5)

Output activation function employs pure line transfer function as follows:

\begin{aligned} {\beta }_2\left( x,t\right) =purelin\ \left( x,t\right) =(x,t). \end{aligned}

(6)

2.
Loss Function: By a comparative study of the obtained values x(t) and the target value v, the loss function estimates the error propagation in the presented model (t). In other words, across distinct time instances, the loss function measures the cumulative error. The Euclidean distance is considered in the current model for estimating the overall loss.

Mathematically,

\begin{aligned} L(x,v)= \sum _{t=1}^{n} L_{t} (x(t),v(t))\\ L_{t} (x(t),v(t)) = \sqrt{\sum _{i=1}^{n} \left( v(t)_{i}-x(t)_{i}\right) ^2 }. \end{aligned}

Visualization and alert generation sub-layer
This layer functions as an visualization module that assists with geo-location identification for COVID-19 spread. The primary task of this layer is to introduce the anticipated E_{sov} result to the user’s hand-held gadget. For adequacy, a liquid crystal screen (LCS) is needed for showing the outcome to the user progressively over temporal basis. Besides, rather than showing the numeric estimation of the results, the representation with alert message is presented by self-organization mapping (SOM) strategy. SOM has been demonstrated to be a promising tool for recognizing pandemic infection zones. The motivation behind this sub-layer is to look at the spatial appropriation of infection pandemic zones and recognize COVID-19 areas by applying the presented spatial investigation methods. SOM utilizes geographical information system (GIS) procedures. To direct a GIS-based examination of the spatial spread of COVID-19, GIS strategy is used in ArcGIS 10.2 programming. SOM strategy empowers dynamic introduction dependent on the shaded coding plan. The proposed T-RNN model for forecasting is fused with U-network for executing SOM method [20]. Figure 6 represents the U-network details. Generally, it is taken as

\mathbf{Low} Z_{dom} Value - > \mathbf{Green} Color

\mathbf{Medium} Z_{dom} Value - > \mathbf{Yellow} Color

\mathbf{High} Z_{dom} Value - > \mathbf{Red} Color.

The combination of SOM and GIS has been effectively intended to create dynamic perception which thus helps the general well-being administration for detecting COVID-19 spread. The problem area of investigation has been led by utilizing novel spatial techniques of SOM. The proposed model will be helpful to choose the infected patients. Additionally, notice that information transmission from fog computing to LCS gadgets can be realized utilizing various remote advances such as ZigBee and Wi-Fi dependent on particular specifications. A SOM-based outline of the COVID-19 spread is shown in Fig. 7.

Experimental implementation
The simulation of the proposed model was performed in a certifiable situation in which three regional datasets were acquired and assessed from Amritsar, India. Regional IDs were given to every area in particular R1, R2, and R3. Every locale was assessed by utilizing different sensors like WiSense hubs, actuators, and RFID’s over the iFogSim tool. Because of the heterogeneous climate, aggregate values were gained utilizing ten sensors. The effectiveness of sensors is shown in Table 6. Information gathered from these sensors is sent to Amazon EC2 distributed storage for investigating utilizing the STATA platform. The proposed model was actualized over the PC framework having the arrangement of Intel i5 Quad-center processor of 3.3 GHz clock cycle with 8-gigabyte memory utilizing MATLAB running on Windows 10. Simulations were performed over the datasets of almost 3296 cases for numerous periods. The FCM arrangement is actualized to sort users into infection and non-infection classifications. Because of the non-accessibility of the informational collection of COVID-19, synthetic information is produced to direct investigations and execution assessment of the proposed model. The analysis is partitioned into the accompanying sections:

1.
Data generation accuracy,

2.
Classification analysis efficiency,

3.
Prediction performance.

Data generation
Information is acquired so that an in-depth assessment of the presented model is performed. To adequately produce COVID-19-related analysis, the dataset is classified into non-infected and infected sickness class category [21]. The parameters for distinguishing COVID-19 are estimated based on the probabilities range. Henceforth, 12 symptoms are incorporated for the user to experience COVID-19 during the week, with reactions as ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ The dataset is produced by setting the probabilities for healthcare well-being. The dataset is initially standardized to change manifestations esteems acknowledged in ‘yes’ or ‘no’ in the reach [0,1] as indicated by symptoms in Table 7. The arrangement exactness of the FCM calculation is tried with ‘m’ features which change in the range [1,2]. For every decision of ‘m,’ we test the different factual features for particular exactness, accuracy, review, and f-measure. Table 8 depicts the arrangement execution of the FCM classifier with an alternate estimation of the ‘m’ feature, and the most noteworthy precision is accomplished with m = 2.1. The probabilities of each COVID-19 detection are depicted in Table 9, which is fused during any recently produced cases. Overall, the results are portrayed in Table 9. The information gained from different data collections is assessed at Amazon EC2 cloud, where it is examined utilizing the STATA toolbox.

Classification analysis
Contingent on the COVID-19 information, the proposed model classifies the patient into one of the previously mentioned classes. For this, the assessment measurements can be utilized for estimating characterization execution. The proposed model is assessed by four measurements which incorporate precision, f-measure, accuracy, and recall to assess the effectiveness of FCM. The outcomes are given in Table 9 that the framework can productively classify users into the previously mentioned conceivable classes. For exactness assessment, FCM has a higher value than fuzzy k-nearest neighbor (FKNN) as shown in Fig. 8a. The accuracy of the classification is found in Fig. 8b. Figure 8c, d portrays that recall and f-measure of the proposed classifier are high when contrasted with different strategies, for example, FKNN, naive Bayes (NB), and Random Decision Tree (RDT) [22]. Based on this, the presented model is considered as most effective as compared to other state-of-the-art models. Naive Bayes has delivered an average precision of 91.8%, the accuracy of 89.6%, review of 84.8%, and f-measure of 88.6%. On the other hand, FKNN delivered an exactness of 93.9%, the accuracy of 93.4%, review of 93.6%, and f-measure of 94.0%. RDT created an exactness of 94.0%, the accuracy of 92.1%, review of 92.5\%, and f-measure of 91.2%. The proposed FCM classifier, when applied to the dataset, delivered results with the higher exactness of 95.9%, the accuracy of 94.7%, review of 95.8%, and f-measure 95.2%. From these correlations, we infer that the proposed FCM classifier yields more exact and proficient outcomes.

Prediction analysis
T-RNN training
The layers referenced in the proposed model were executed in various sections. Moreover, Python was utilized for pre-handling. FCM classifier is utilized for the characterization of COVID-19 classes for expectation purposes. For deployment purposes, the information is progressively disseminated among the hubs over the neural network. In light of pre-fixed models, the testing of COVID-19 is performed. For recreation purposes, numerous features were adapted to tuning. Data collection that contains inappropriate or missing information will be overseen utilizing different approximation techniques. We investigated an auto-encoder idle component portrayal in spatio-temporal information with T-RNN for missing COVID-19 information ascription. In the actualized RNN, the size of the information layer comprises six neurons (no. of COVID-19 features), and the output layer contains one neuron. As the layers of the RNN model were fully connected with 15 hubs in the first concealed layer and 10 hubs in the second layer. The enhancer utilized for the RNN model is Adam alongside the ReLU initiation work. The 2817 instances of the dataset were utilized for preparing and 479 cases for testing purposes. The outcomes of the simulation analysis of the proposed model are depicted in Table 10.

T-RNN model-based prediction efficiency
Expectation effectiveness is continuously estimated for the dataset. A lot of heterogeneous information is created for different datasets. Moreover, it is important to inspect in detail for productive expectation investigation [23]. The outcome shows that the proposed model beats state-of-the-art techniques of long short-term memory networks, generative adversarial networks, and convolutional neural networks. Moreover, different factual measures are assessed for productive forecast efficacy. From the determined situation, it very well may be seen that T-RNN is more effective and delicate for COVID-19 prediction. To analyze the expectation models, different statistical measures, for example, normalized root mean square (NRMS), Pearson’s relationship coefficient (PCCE), and median outright error (MSE), are determined [24].

Based on the simulations, outcomes are more nearer to the efficiency line by accomplishing more precision when contrasted with different models. Likewise, the model additionally delivers low errors which are approved by assessing NRMS and MSE rates. By accomplishing the agreeable estimations of NRMS, PCCE, and MSE, we can reason that the scale expectation execution is more effective when contrasted with different models. Consequently, it is presumed that the T-RNN persists in high consistency with minimal error rates.

Prediction latency
This section evaluates the performance analysis of prediction model by two parameters:

1. Latency time (LT) 2. Response delay (RD)

1.
Latency time - It is fog and cloud computing’s latency rate. It is measured as the difference between data analytic computing time and the time to send a fog node warning message to a user.

LT_{\triangle _{t}} = Time _{analytic} - Time_{ alert}

where Time_{generate} denotes the time instance for creating the results and Time _{display} denotes the time at which it is visualized on the user screen.

2.
Response delay - This concentrated on the response time. It also integrates with the responsive metric to measure on the visualization screen the necessary prediction result to be produced and is calculated as:

RD _{\triangle _{t}} = Time_{generate} - Time_{display} .

Figure 9 portrays the aftereffects of the proposed model which are acquired during several simulations. The outcomes based on the calculations are determined and portrayed in Fig. 9a. A practically identical contrast can appear regarding the time rate for creating an alarm message to the user based on healthcare. Also, it examines that the considered framework of fog computing is more effective. In Fig. 9b, it very well may be seen that the bend emerges with regard to the numerical analysis. Be that as it may, it very well may be seen the time concerning manual detection, reaction time estimation of the proposed model is 5.16s per information feature, while the manual checking framework takes mean estimation of 16.36s per information value. Henceforth, in the current scenario, the introduced strategy of intense COVID-19 production is effective in contrast to the manual checking technique.

Reliability
In addition to the above, to quantify the general outcomes acquired, the proposed model is examined for reliability. For confirmation, only the prediction model is altered and examined. From the implementation results, it is seen that the introduced model accomplished higher precision when contrasted with others. Figure 10 portrays the detailed examination of the proposed model precision. Because of the eventual outcome, it is inferred that the proposed model has higher precision averaging 91% when compared with the other strategies of ANN and RFT. Based on execution prediction examination, it is depicted that the proposed model is profoundly reliable in contrast with other state-of-the-art edge procedures.
