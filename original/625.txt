Abstract
Reliability evaluation of interconnection networks is of significant importance to the design and maintenance of interconnection networks. The extra edge-connectivity and component edge-connectivity are two important parameters for the reliability evaluation of interconnection networks. In this paper, we determine the h-extra edge-connectivity of an n-dimensional augmented cube for h≤2[n2], n≥2 and 2n−1+22−f3≤h≤2n−1 where n≥4, f=0 when n is even, and f=1 when n is odd. Moreover, we also determine the r-component edge-connectivity of an n-dimensional augmented cube for r≤2[n2]+1, n≥7.

1. Introduction
The interconnection network has been an important research area in the field of parallel and distribute systems. Typically, the topology of an interconnection network is often modeled by a connected graph  where the vertices represent processors and the edges represent communication links between the processors.

For graph definitions and notations, we follow the work of [2]. We use 
 to denote all neighbors of  in  and use 
 to denote the order of 
. For , let 
 be the set of edges in which each edge contains exactly one end vertex in . If  or if , then  denotes the subgraph of  induced by . For two disjoint subgraphs or vertex sets ,  of , we use  the edges with one endpoint in  and the other in .

Reliability is an important criterion when designing interconnection networks. Edge connectivity is an important parameter for analyzing the fault tolerance of networks. The edge connectivity of , denoted by , is the minimum size of an edge set  such that  is disconnected. In [19], edge connectivity mainly considers the failure of the connection between the vertices of the interconnection network. It is a fundamental index to measure the reliability of the interconnection network. Thus the higher the edge connectivity is, the more reliable the network is. However, this parameter has some intrinsic shortcomings. Firstly, a lot of graphs with the same edge connectivity behave quite differently in fault tolerance. Secondly, as explained in [19], since edge connectivity measures the worst case failures, which seldom occur in the real world, the resilience of a network is drastically underestimated. To overcome such shortcomings, several new concepts on the edge-connectivity of graphs were proposed which can be called conditional edge-connectivity by Harary [10]. Two of them are the extra edge-connectivity and the component edge-connectivity. Extra edge-connectivity was introduced by Fàbrega and Foil [6]. For a given positive integer , an -extra edge-cut of a connected graph  is defined as an edge set  of graph , whose deletion yields a disconnected graph with all its components having at least  vertices. The -extra edge-connectivity of a connected graph , denoted by 
, is the minimum cardinality taken over all -extra edge-cuts of . It is obvious that 
. The -component edge connectivity was introduced by E. Sampathkumar [18]. An -component edge cut of  is a set  of edges,  has at least  components. The -component edge connectivity 
 of  is the size of the smallest -component edge cut. Recently, the -extra edge connectivity and the -component edge connectivity of particular classes of the interconnection networks have received extensive attention  [3], [5], [7], [8], [9], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29] and so on. This paper focuses on determining the exact values of -extra edge connectivity and the -component edge connectivity of the augmented cube for given  and , respectively.

The hypercube is the most popular topology being used in interconnection networks which possess many good properties such as strong connectivity, small diameter, symmetry, recursive construction, relatively small degree, and regularity [1], [12]. As an enhancement on the hypercube, the augmented cube, proposed by Choudum and Sunitha [5], not only retains some of the favorable properties of the hypercube, but also possesses some embedding properties that the hypercube does not have [11], [16].

Let  be a positive integer. The definition of the -dimensional augmented cube is stated as the following.

The -dimensional augmented cube, denoted by 
, has 
 vertices, each labeled by an -bit binary string and 
 where 
 is called as the th-coordinate of 
 for . 
 is a complete graph 
 of two vertices labeled with 0 and 1, respectively. For , 
 can be recursively constructed from two copies of 
, denoted by 
 and 
, and by adding  edges between 
 and 
, where 
, 
. Vertex 
 is adjacent to 
, if and only if either

(1) 
 for ; or

(2) 
 
 for , where 
 
.

From the definition, we can see that each vertex of 
 has exactly two neighbors in 
 and vice versa. In fact, 
 can be obtained by adding two perfect matchings between 
 and 
. Hence 
 can be viewed as 
 briefly. Sometimes we also use 
 and 
 to denote 
 and 
, where 
. Clearly, 
 is -regular. Hence 
. The augmented cubes 
, 
, and 
 are illustrated in Fig. 1.

For the -extra edge connectivity and the -component edge connectivity of the -dimension augmented cubes 
, there exist no general results. Ma et al. [17] reported some results for the special cases for . They showed that 
, 
.

Let 
 
 denote the maximum number of edges of the subgraph induced by a vertex set with a given size  in 
, i.e., 
 is the maximum sum of degree of the subgraph induced by a vertex set with a given size  in 
. M.-J. Chien et al. [4] showed that 
 where 
, 
 for  and 
. But this result is not true for  is odd. In this paper, we first correct this result, determine that 
, where 
, 
 for , 
, and  when  is even,  when  is odd. Using this result, we determine the -extra edge-connectivity and the -component edge connectivity of the -dimension augmented cubes for 
 
, 
 
 where  when  is even, and  when  is odd and 
 
, respectively.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 determines the maximum size of a subgraph induced by  vertices in augmented cubes. Section 3 determines the extra edge-connectivity of the augmented cube. Section 4 determines the component edge-connectivity of the augmented cube. Section 5 concludes this paper with some final remarks.

5. Concluding remarks
In this paper, we determine the maximum size of a subgraph induced by a vertex set with a given size in the augmented cubes. Moreover, we applied the result to further derive two fault tolerance measurements for the augmented cubes, including its extra edge-connectivity and component edge-connectivity. The extra edge-connectivity and the component edge-connectivity are both extension of standard edge connectivity. They can also be viewed as an understanding of the fault resiliency of interconnection networks. In the future work, we would like to study the structural property of some popular interconnection networks such as star graphs (and their super class of graphs called -star graphs and arrangement graphs), bubble-sort graphs, and alternating group graphs, etc.
