Abstract
Enhancing the invulnerability of multiprocessor systems against malicious attacks has been regarded as one of the important issues in network science and big data era. Thus, in order to firmly characterize the robustness of systems, several variants of classic connectivity have been proposed so far. The component connectivity is a significant metric in evaluating the robustness and fault tolerability of interconnection network. For an interconnection network G and a positive integer h, the (h+1)-component connectivity of G, denoted cκh+1(G), is the cardinality of a minimum vertex cut F such that G−F has at least h+1 connected components. Based on component connectivity, component diagnosability has been proposed to measure the self-diagnosis capability of multiprocessor systems. In this paper, we suggest some characterizations of the (h+1)-component connectivity of a class of regular networks under some restrictions. Furthermore, we establish the relationship between component connectivity and component diagnosability of one class of networks. As by-products, we present the (h+1)-component diagnosability of the state-of-the-art compound networks based on hypercube, such as bicube network, generalized exchanged hypercube, hierarchical hypercube, half-hypercube, and so on.

1. Introduction
With the rapid development and advances of very large scale integration technology and wafer-scale integration technology, multiprocessor systems have been widely designed and used in our daily life. Multiprocessor systems, playing an important role in parallel and distributed computing as well as big data processing, usually contain thousands of or even more processors [32], such as Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer and Tianhe-2 supercomputer of China, Summit supercomputer of American, Fugaku supercomputer of Japan.

The multiprocessor systems commonly use interconnection networks (or graphs) as the underlying topological model, in which the processors and communication links are portrayed as vertices and edges, respectively. However, with the expansion of network scale and the improvement of complexity in the multiprocessor system, many faults that occur are inevitable, and it is expected that when several vertices are removed, the remaining network may yield a large component and some small components with minimal number of vertices, where the core of this network is still intact. Thereby, it can continue to work. Notice that the vulnerability causes the loss of essential functions of networks, which operate on the assumption that all vertices are connected. Generally, networks with weak connectivity are vulnerable to adversarial attacks which can easily destroy network structures, leading to the network system collapse. Therefore, the invulnerability analysis of network is especially important and indispensable.

As a fundamental issue in the robustness analysis of multi-computer networks, the topic on connectivity has recently attracted wide attention, accompanied by the emergence of all kinds of variants of connectivity. Connectivity, the cardinality of a minimum vertex subset whose removal causes a network to become disconnected or trivial, has been regarded as a fundamental technique to enhance the invulnerability of large scale multiprocessor networks. The classic connectivity is often too strict to realistically reflect a network's robustness, because it is only confined to the network's minimum degree. To better measure the actual robustness of network, the conditional connectivity, adding some restrictions on components of the remaining network, was initially pioneered by Harary [15] in 1983, who carries this idea one step further. Given a graph-theoretic property P for a connected graph, the P-conditional connectivity is the minimum cardinality of a vertex set whose deletion can disconnect G but every remaining component would still possess the property P. Subsequently, Hsu et al. [16] introduced the concept of component connectivity, which refers to the minimum number of vertices whose removal leads to a network with at least h components; and they established the -component connectivity of the n-dimensional hypercube for . As a significant index, component connectivity has been widely studied and applied. Zhao et al. [40] explored the -component connectivity of the n-dimensional hypercube for . Cheng et al. investigated the -component connectivity of the n-dimensional hierarchical cubic network [6] and its extension [5], as well as the -component connectivity of the n-dimensional generalized exchanged hypercubes [7]. Recently, Zhao and Yang [41] determined the -component connectivity of the n-dimensional folded hypercube for . Chang et al. [3], [4] determined the -component connectivity of alternating group networks and show that 
 and 
 for . Lin et al. [23] investigated the h-component connectivity of the split-star network 
 for  and . Guo [12] computed the h-component connectivity of twisted cubes. Gu and Hao et al. [9], [11] successively established the component connectivity of bubble-sort star graphs , burnt pancake graphs  and hierarchical star networks , respectively. Gu et al. [10] also obtained the component connectivity and component edge connectivity of balanced hypercubes. It is worthy mentioning that, Li et al. [19] explored the relationship between extra connectivity and component connectivity of some regular networks. Meanwhile, Guo et al. [13] determined the relation of extra edge connectivity and component edge connectivity for a class of compound networks based on hypercube. Hao et al. [14] established the relationship between extra edge connectivity and component edge connectivity of some well-known networks.

The diagnosability of a multiprocessor system is the maximum number of faulty processors that the system is guaranteed to identify. Similar to conditional connectivity, conditional diagnosability is of more practice in the real network system. Chang and Hsien [1], [2] investigated the conditional diagnosability of -star network and alternating group networks under the PMC model, respectively. Wang et al. [34] addressed the 2-good-neighbor diagnosability of Cayley graphs generated by transposition trees under the PMC model and MM* model. Hu et al. [17] studied the relationship of g-good-neighbor diagnosability for some known network between the PMC model and the MM* model. Liu et al. [25] investigated the g-extra conditional diagnosability of hierarchical cubic networks. Zhang et al. [38] studied the g-extra conditional diagnosability of twisted hypercubes under MM* model. Lin et al. [22] established the g-extra connectivity and conditional diagnosability of alternating group networks. After that, Lin et al. [24] explored the relationship between the h-extra vertex-connectivity and h-extra conditional diagnosability for regular networks, under the classic PMC diagnostic model. Recently, based on component connectivity, the component diagnosability of networks has been proposed by Zhang et al. [36]. Furthermore, they established the component diagnosability of hypercube 
 under PMC and MM* diagnosis models. Sun et al. [33] successively studied -component connectivity and corresponding component diagnosability of hierarchical folded cubic networks with  and . Inspired by the idea above, we first characterize the -component connectivity of a family of regular networks, and establish the relationship between component diagnosability and component connectivity of these networks. As an empirical study, we apply the newly founded relationship to a class of well-known regular networks, including hypercubes as well as compound networks based on hypercube, such as the bicube network, the generalized exchanged hypercube, the hierarchical hypercube, half-hypercube, etc.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews some preliminaries and related definition and lemmas on component connectivity and component diagnosability. Our main results as well as the detailed proofs are presented in Section 3. Thereafter, we apply the newly founded relationship to a variety of well-known regular networks to directly determine their component diagnosability in Section 4. Finally, the paper concludes with some discussions and future directions of research in Section 5.

2. Preliminary
We now review some theoretical concepts about graphs and networks. Throughout this paper, a graph  represents an interconnection network, where each vertex  denotes a processor and each edge  denotes a communication link between two processors u and v. We use  to denote the Hamming distance which is the length of a shortest path between u and v. For a vertex , we use 
 to denote the neighbor vertices set of u, 
 to denote the vertex set 
. And for any vertex set S, 
 
. For a vertex set , the graph induced by S is denoted by . For a subgraph ,  represents a graph obtained by removing the vertices of F and their incident edges from G. For any two vertices , we denote  the number of common neighbors they share, i.e., . Let . For a set S, the cardinality of S is denoted by . Given two different vertex-subsets 
, the symmetric difference of two sets 
 and 
 is defined as 
﹨
﹨
. For other concepts and notations, we will introduce them before the corresponding results or recommend the readers to consult monographs [35], [43].

As a crucial metric for the resilience of network G, the -component connectivity, denoted by 
, refers to the cardinality of minimum vertex-cut whose delation leads to a network with at least h components; It is clearly that 
 and 
. In light of the possible applications of the presented connectivity metric, we also point out the crucial role of system-level fault diagnosis in the resilience and robustness of networks. For a multiprocessor system with faulty processors, the process of identifying faulty processors is called system-level fault diagnosis. In fault diagnosis, the PMC model was initially pioneered by Preparata, Metze, and Chien [30], the first diagnostic model, which is based on graph modeling and has been widely applied. The PMC model assumes that each processor can test its neighbors, and judge the testees are either faulty or fault-free. The diagnosability of a multiprocessor system, denoted by , is the maximum number of faulty processors that the system is guaranteed to identify.

Lemma 2.1

[30] Let  be a multiprocessor system. Then, for any two faulty sets 
 with 
, under the PMC model, 
 is a distinguishable pair if and only if there exists a vertex 
, which is adjacent to a vertex 
 (see Fig. 1).

Motivated by the idea of conditional diagnosability, Zhang et al. [36] proposed the -component diagnosability of a network recently. Naturally, the component diagnosability of G is a generalization of the classical conditional diagnosability.

Definition 2.2

[36] For a multiprocessor system G,

(1) an -component fault cut F of G is a vertex set such that  has at least  components;

(2) a system G is -component t-diagnosable if and only if for any two distinct -component faulty subsets 
 and 
 of  such that 
, 
, 
 and 
 are distinguishable;

(3) the -component diagnosability of a multiprocessor system, denoted by 
, is the maximum number of faulty vertices which can guarantee to locate with the condition that G is -component fault t-diagnosable.

3. Relationship between component diagnosability and component connectivity of a class of regular networks
Generally, the network system with high connectivity performance exhibits high resilience against malfunctioning. In this section, we mainly explore the relationship between component diagnosability and component connectivity of a class of regular networks under some restricted conditions.

Theorem 3.1

Let G be the t-regular triangle-free connected network with . If G satisfies the following two conditions:

(1)
there exists a subgraph A of G with 
, where 
 and 
 with  and , subject to that 
;

(2)
for any subset  with 
 
,  is either connected or it has a large component of at least  vertices.

Then, the -component connectivity of G is 
 
.
Proof

By condition (1), there exists some subgraph 
 such that 
 for  (see Fig. 2). Let 
. Clearly, T is an isolated vertex set with . Since G is triangle-free, we have 
. In view of 
, every pair of 
 and 
 shares exactly one neighbor other than u in G. Moreover, u is the only common neighbor of all vertices of T. Hence,
  Thereby,
  
  Of particular note,
 
 
 Thus, 
, i.e., 
 has at least one component. It implies that 
 has at least  components. By Definition 2.2, 
 is an -component vertex-cut of G. Hence,
 
 
 the desired.

In the following, it suffices to show that 
 . Suppose, to the contrary, that S is an -component vertex cut of G with  
 . Then  has at least  components. Since  is disconnected, by condition (2),  has a component containing at least  vertices. As a result,  consists of a large component and small components containing at most  vertices. It is easy to observe that the number of components in  is no more than h, which implies that S is not an -component vertex-cut, a contradiction. Thus, 
 
.

Summing up above, the -component connectivity of G is 
 
, the desired. □

The relationship on component connectivity and component diagnosability for regular network G is characterized in the following theorem.

Theorem 3.2

Given a t-regular triangle-free network G and an integer h with . Let 
 be the -component connectivity of G and 
 be the -component diagnosability of G. If G satisfies the following conditions:

(1)
;

(2)
there exists a subgraph A of G with 
, where 
 and 
 with  and , subject to that 
;

(3)
for any subset  with 
 
,  is either connected or it has a large component of at least  vertices.

Then, the relationship between -component connectivity and -component diagnosability of G under the PMC model is
 
Proof

We first show that the upper bound of -component diagnosability 
 under the PMC model is 
 for .

By condition (2), we find a subgraph A induced by the vertex set 
 such that A is isomorphic to 
 with 
 for  (see Fig. 3). Take 
. Assume that 
 and 
. Clearly, 
 and 
.

It follows that
 
 

Thus, we have
 
 and
 
 Therefore,
 
 

It is observed that 
 has at least  isolated vertices and a larger component in the remaining network. Similarly, 
 has at least h isolated vertices and a larger component in the remaining network. Thus, 
 and 
 are two distinct -component vertex-cuts. In terms of 
 and 
, there exists no edge between 
 and 
. Thus, 
 and 
 are indistinguishable under the PMC model. Therefore, 
 
 for .

Next, it suffices to show that 
 
 under the PMC model. To this aim, we shall adopt a method of contradiction and assume that 
 
 for . Let 
 be two distinct -component fault vertex-cut of G with 
 
, 
 
 such that 
 and 
 are indistinguishable under the PMC model. By condition (3), 
 consists of a larger component H plus some relatively small components with at most h vertices in total. Let 
. And we have , which implies that
 
 
 More specifically, H is a maximum component in 
 and 
 
. Since 
 and 
 are indistinguishable under the PMC model, there exists no edge between 
 and 
 
. So 
. Thereby, 
, i.e., 
. Analogously, 
. As 
 and 
 are two distinct sets, 
. Without loss of generality, we set 
, i.e., 
. Note that 
 has a large component H and small components. Since 
 is an -component cut, the subgraph  contains at least h components. Then , and thus 
, which is a contradiction. Therefore, 
 
, the desired.

From what has been discussed above, the relationship between -component connectivity and -component diagnosability of G under the PMC model is 
. □

4. Applications to a class of well-known networks
Component connectivity as a new metric is taken to evaluate the robustness of network, which incorporates information about the number of components within a network. A lot of effort has been devoted to the development to establish the component connectivity of distinct networks. And it is reasonable to consider the component diagnosability of some general networks. In Section 3, we have investigated the relationship between component connectivity and component diagnosability of networks under some restricted conditions. In what following, we will apply Theorem 3.2, Theorem 3.1 to some state-of-the-art regular networks which take hypercube as basic module.

4.3. The generalized exchanged hypercube 
The generalized exchange hypercube, introduced by Cheng et al. [7], is a generation of the exchanged hypercube proposed by Loh et al. [28]. Cheng et al. [7] provided the -component connectivity of generalized exchanged hypercubes for  and . Li et al. [20] studied the g-good-neighbor connectivity and g-good-neighbor diagnosability of generalized exchanged X-cubes under the PMC and MM* models. Next, we introduce the definition of the generalized exchange hypercube.

4.4. The hierarchical hypercube network 
The hierarchical hypercube was initially presented by Malluhi and Bayoumi [29], which is a variant of the cube connected-cycle 
 [31], and the cycle is substituted for a hypercube. Zhou et al. [42] established the conditional fault diagnosisability of hierarchical hypercubes. Zhao et al. [39] addressed the g-good-neighbor connectivity and diagnosability under the PMC model and MM* model for .

4.5. The half hypercube network 
The n-dimensional half-hypercube network, denoted by 
, proposed by Kim et al. [18], which owns the same number of vertices as the hypercube but reduces the degree by approximately half, is worthy of investigation. Lv et al. [27] established the g-good-neighbor connectivity and diagnosability of half-hypercube under the PMC and MM* models.

Theorem 4.23

For the half hypercube

Proof

First, we show the upper bound of the -component connectivity of half hypercube 
 by the construction method. In terms of hierarchical property of

 and 
, that is, every pair of

  Hence,
 
 
 
 
 
 Thus,

Next, we show 
 
  by contradiction. Suppose, to the contrary, that F is an -component vertex cut of

 . Then 
 has at least  components. In terms of Lemma 4.3, 
 has a component containing at least  vertices. As a result, 
 contains a large component and small components containing at most  vertices. It is easy to check that the number of components in 
 is not more than h, which implies that F is not an -component vertex-cut, a contradiction. Hence, 
 
 .

Summing up above, we have 
 
 
, as required. □

Theorem 4.24

It follows that
 
 
 Thus, we have

 Notice that
 
 
 
 Therefore, 
 has at least  isolated vertices and a larger component in the remaining network. Similarly, 
 has at least h isolated vertices and a larger component in the remaining network. Thus, 
 and 
 are two distinct -component vertex-cuts. In terms of 
 and 
, there exists no edge between 
 and 
. Thus, 
 and

Next, it suffices to show that 
 
 
 under the PMC model by contradiction. Let

 consists of a larger component H plus some relatively small components with at most h vertices. Let 
. And we have , which implies that
 
 
 
 Hence, H is a maximum component in 
 and 
 
. Since 
 and

 and 
 
. So 
. Thereby, 
, i.e., 
. Similarly, 
. As 
 and 
 are two distinct sets, 
. Without loss of generality, we set

 contains at least h components. Then , and so 
, which is a contradiction. Therefore, 
 
 
, the desired. □

In particular, when n is even, the n-dimensional half hypercube network is isomorphic to an 
 
-dimensional hierarchical cubic network, i.e., 
 
. The hierarchical cubic network 
 is shown in Fig. 9. Therefore, we directly determine the -component connectivity and -component diagnosability of hierarchical cubic networks as follows.

5. Conclusions
Component connectivity that incorporate the information of the number of components on the basis of a network' connectivity may be more useful for the robustness of a network. Therefore, in this paper, we establish the relationship on component connectivity and component diagnosability of regular networks. As applications, we determine the -component diagnosability of the state-of-the-art regular networks, including hypercubes as well as compound networks based on hypercube, such as the bicube network, the generalized exchanged hypercube, the hierarchical hypercube, half-hypercube, etc. A brief summary of component connectivity and component diagnosability of the above-mentioned multiprocessor systems is presented in Table 1. Our next work will consider the component connectivity and component diagnosability of a class of more general networks. It can seem a very meaningful and challengeable task.
