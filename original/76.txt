Abstract
Head-worn displays (HWDs) have been studied extensively in healthcare and industrial contexts over the past years. In this survey paper, we analyse the use of HWDs that do not occlude the view of the environment in those two domains. In addition, we explore researchers' approaches to the design of HWD applications. Across four databases we found 351 papers that describe HWD applications in healthcare or industrial contexts. All located papers were systematically categorized and a subset of 96 unique and influential papers was selected to be included in this survey paper. The paper offers three main contributions. First, we describe seven distinct groups of HWD use cases. Second, we show that papers seldom report that design principles, previous research, or user input have informed the design of HWD applications. Third, we illustrate similarities and key differences between HWD research in the healthcare and industrial domains and show that research in each domain has considerable relevance for the other. Based on the results of our analysis, we summarize recommendations for the design of HWD applications, and outline promising future research directions.

1. Introduction
The development of head-worn displays (HWDs) has come a long way. The first HWD prototype reported was developed by Ivan Sutherland in 1968 (Sutherland, 1968), and was intended to make data ubiquitously available by projecting it onto the environment as a digital information layer (Sutherland, 1965). Because of technological limitations, however, this HWD had to be mounted to the ceiling and could display only simple line graphics. Over the following decades, the use of HWDs outside research laboratories continued to be hindered by their weight, lack of computational power, and inability to display complex graphics or to interpret user inputs (Azuma et al., 2001). However, in the last 10 years HWDs such as Google Glass and Microsoft HoloLens have overcome many of the aforementioned issues.

Nevertheless, HWDs have been relatively unsuccessful on the consumer market due to privacy concerns, usability issues, and their form factor (Adapa et al., 2018; Hofmann et al., 2017; Hong, 2013). This might be one of the reasons why many recent research projects have explored the potential of HWD technology in professional contexts (Aungst and Lewis, 2015; Glauser, 2013; Ruppert et al., 2018), where HWDs’ unique features could increase productivity and safety. The two professional domains where the most HWD research has been conducted to date are healthcare and industry (Dey et al., 2018). In the context of this paper, we define 'industry' as the sector that produces goods or related services, and 'healthcare' as the sector that maintains or improves the health of people.

In this survey paper, we provide an overview of HWD applications for healthcare and industrial workers. The objective is to help researchers and designers find HWD papers related to their own work, and to provide guidance when they attempt to develop and evaluate HWD applications for professional settings. We answer the following three research questions: (RQ1) Which tasks in healthcare and industrial environments have been supported with HWDs, (RQ2) how and for what reasons have HWD applications been designed, and (RQ3) what are key similarities and differences between HWD research in the two domains? In the remainder of the introduction, we will describe properties of HWD hardware and software, detail the scope of this paper, summarise previous survey papers, and outline the novelty and contribution of our work.

1.1. Properties of HWDs and scope of this survey paper
HWD hardware and software can be differentiated based on a variety of factors, including data input, data visualisation, size of the visual field, display technology, modes of wireless communication, and computational power. However, the most elementary properties of HWD applications might be the general type of hardware used and the spatiality of software implemented.

Considering HWD hardware, commonly used types are optical see-through HWDs that merge environment and digital content with semi-transparent optical elements, video see-through HWDs that capture the environment with head-mounted cameras and combine video stream and computer generated graphics in real-time, and opaque HWDs that fully or partially occlude the visual field and enable virtual reality applications or peripheral information displays, respectively (Cakmakci and Rolland, 2006). All non-fully occluding HWD types are available as monocular or binocular models that sit in front of one eye or both eyes of the wearer.

Considering HWD software, two elementary types of user interfaces can be implemented. Nonspatial user interfaces present content in a traditional 'windows, icons, menus, pointer' (WIMP) manner and resemble smartphone applications. In contrast, spatial user interfaces map three-dimensional computer graphics onto real world objects in the environment and adapt the view interactively according to the user's orientation and inputs. In the following we refer to spatial HWD applications as augmented reality (AR) applications (Azuma, 1997).

In this work, we analyse both AR and nonspatial user interfaces for healthcare and industry workers that are displayed on optical see-through, video see-through, and partially occluding opaque HWDs—in other words, HWDs that do not fully occlude the view of the environment. The particular scope of the present survey paper is driven by our aim to explore how HWDs are being used to support work in professional contexts (see RQ1).

In line with this aim, we do not review applications for patients and customers who may experience a HWD application only once (e.g., as treatment, or as marketing tool during a sales pitch), whereas professionals may use HWDs repeatedly over a prolonged period of time (e.g., as a tool). Similarly, we did not review HWD applications that fully occlude the environment because they present the user with a simulated digital world, whereas non-fully-occluding HWDs, running AR and nonspatial applications, can support users during their work in a physical environment. Unless stated otherwise, in the following we refer to the subgroup of non-fully-occluding HWDs when using the term 'HWD'.

1.2. Previous survey papers
Various papers have partially surveyed HWD research in the healthcare and industrial domains. However, the primary focus of all review efforts except one was concepts such as AR or wearable devices instead of HWD applications. In the following, we summarise the scope of previous survey papers (see Table 1 for an overview).


Table 1. Overview of previous survey papers about wearable devices, smart glasses, and AR in healthcare and industrial contexts. For comparison, in the last row, the present survey is listed.

Publication	Domain (Subdomain)	Focus	Reviewed papers
Iqbal et al. (2016)	Healthcare	Wearable devices	24
Kolodzey et al. (2017)	Healthcare (Surgery)	Wearable devices	87
Mitrasinovic et al. (2015)	Healthcare (Surgery)	Smart glasses	71
Wei et al. (2018)	Healthcare (Surgery)	Google glass	31
Rahman et al. (2020)	Healthcare (Surgery)	HWDs	120
Wüller et al. (2019)	Healthcare (Nursing)	AR	23

Palmarini et al. (2018)	Industry (Manufacturing)	AR	30
Gattullo et al. (2020)	Industry	AR	122
This survey	Healthcare and Industry	HWDs	96
In the context of healthcare, survey papers (Iqbal et al., 2016; Kolodzey et al., 2017) clustered different wearable device applications but were unable to assess the impact of the technology on patient safety, due to the small number of randomised controlled trials published. Mitrasinovic et al. (2015) provided an overview of smart glass applications and listed current limitations of the technology. A review focusing on Google Glass (Wei et al., 2018) emphasised the popularity of this particular HWD model amongst clinicians. Finally, the extensive review of Rahman et al. (2020) demonstrated the large extent of HWD research that has been conducted in surgical settings, whereas the work of Wüller et al. (2019) emphasized that AR technology is also used in less technologically saturated medical disciplines such as nursing.

Compared to healthcare, fewer survey papers within the context of industry have been published. Wang et al. (2016) surveyed AR applications supporting assembly whereas Palmarini et al. (2018) focused on maintenance. In a recently published work, Gattullo et al. (2020) assessed which visual assets are used in industrial AR, and what motivates researchers to deploy the technology.

1.3. Novelty and contribution
In comparison to the survey papers introduced above, the present work is novel for three main reasons. First, our scope is broader than other survey papers that have focused on either a specific HWD model (e.g. Google Glass in surgical settings (Wei et al., 2018)), a specific user interface type (e.g. AR in the industry (Gattullo et al., 2020)) or the subsections of a domain (e.g. maintenance (Palmarini et al., 2018), assembly (Wang et al., 2016), surgery (Rahman et al., 2020), or nursing (Wuller et al., 2019)).

A second unique aspect of this survey paper is its applied nature with a focus on HWD application design (e.g. presentation of information, multi-modality, user interaction) instead of on HWD and AR technology (e.g. optical elements, tracking, visualization). The need for a deeper consideration of HWD application design has been highlighted before (Kolodzey et al., 2017) but the design dimensions of HWD applications have not been analysed in detail.

Third, although the idea of comparing the healthcare and industrial domains was previously suggested by Wüller et al. (2019), to our knowledge the present survey is the first work that compares the use of HWDs in two domains. Because previous survey papers have focused primarily on a single application domain, it is unclear whether findings about the design and use of HWD applications that were generated in healthcare or industry contexts align and have relevance for the respective other domain. By surveying both healthcare and industrial HWD use cases, we hope to provide researchers and designers from each domain with an overview of how the other domain has approached certain HWD related challenges and opportunities.

Overall, the present paper makes three main contributions. First, we provide an extensive overview of HWD applications proposed for the healthcare and industrial domains and identify seven distinct groups of HWD use cases (RQ1). Second, we analyse different dimensions of HWD application design and show that in both domains there are few reports that application design was guided by principles, previous research, or user input (RQ2). Third, we discuss key differences between HWD papers in the two domains and argue that HWD research in healthcare is primarily problem driven whereas in the industry it is more technology driven (RQ3). Finally, we summarise recommendations for the design of user centred HWD applications and identify research opportunities for more robust evaluations of HWDs.

2. Method
We adopted the scoping review method (Arksey and O'Malley, 2005; Levac et al., 2010) which is a common tool in clinical research to develop a well-structured overview of the literature, particularly if evidence in the domain is diverse and emerging, as is the case in HWD research (Kolodzey et al., 2017). In contrast to narrative reviews that summarise previous literature without locating papers in a systematic way, scoping reviews provide a reinterpretation of the literature, yet the review process is well defined. In contrast to systematic reviews that only allow the comparison of similar papers and that generate insights through prescribed quantitative tools, scoping reviews allow the inclusion of papers with differing theoretical backgrounds, methods and quality.

To locate relevant literature, we performed searches across ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Web of Knowledge. The following search terms were used ('*' indicates a wildcard of arbitrary length, '?' indicates a single space wildcard):

•
assemb* OR maint* OR warehouse OR manufact* OR industr* OR healthcare OR clinic* OR medic* OR patient* OR nurs*

•
AND hololens OR head mounted display? OR head-mounted display? OR head worn display? OR head-worn display? OR HWD? OR HMD? OR smart glass* OR google glass

•
NOT virtual reality

We decided to include the term “nurs” because previous research has demonstrated that the field of nursing is often overlooked in the context of clinical research. By using this search strategy, we hope to have avoided an unintended bias of our survey towards more technology-intensive contexts such as surgery. To be included in this survey paper, the literature located had to meet five criteria. First, the paper was written in English and was not an abstract. Second, the HWD hardware used did not occlude the view of the environment. Third, the HWD's functionality and user interface were described. Fourth, intended HWD users were staff and not consumers or patients. Fifth, the HWD was developed for the healthcare or industrial domains.

After we identified relevant literature, papers were clustered based on their use case. In other words, HWD applications that supported users during a specific task (e.g., making a precise incision during surgery) were grouped together. Due to the broad range of tasks that are supported by HWDs, this resulted in many categories. We refined the initial categories by looking at the primary purpose of the HWD application presented in the papers (e.g., manual work guidance; see ‘4 Applications’ for an overview). If identifying the primary purpose was impossible, for example because the HWD application was intentionally designed to be useful in different situations, we assigned the paper to multiple categories. We also assigned papers to multiple categories if two different HWD applications were presented or compared with each other.

Once the mapping of the papers to the categories was stable (each paper/HWD application in a category had a similar purpose as the other HWD applications in the category) we selected a subset of papers from each category to be presented in this survey paper. Although this is a departure from standard scoping review methodology, it was necessary due to the high number of papers found in the literature search. To select the most relevant papers in each category, we used a variant of the approach presented by Kim et al. (2018). Specifically, we assessed the main contribution of each paper by asking three questions: ‘Does the paper present a new use case for HWDs?’, ‘Does the paper present a new user interface for HWDs?’, and ‘Does the paper present the evaluation of a HWD in a new setting?’ If two papers were similar in terms of their main contribution (similar use case, similar user interface, and similar evaluation), we selected the paper with the higher number of citations per year to be presented in this survey. By looking at the main contributions of the papers before filtering them based on citation scores, we hoped to avoid overrepresenting older publications which are usually well known and therefore accumulate a high number of citations per year. Our approach allowed us to include very recent papers with few citations if they made a unique contribution. Nevertheless, in research areas with a long history (e.g., HWD-supported endoscopic surgery) older publications were more likely to be selected for presentation. We retrieved the total number of citations for each paper from Google Scholar on 28 August 2019 with a custom Python Script that also calculated the average number of citations per year.

In a final step, specific information was extracted from the papers to generate the insights presented in the following sections. The extracted information was related to the used HWD hardware (model) and software (use case, spatiality of the user interface, multimodality, interaction form), as well as the HWD application design (rationale for developing the HWD application, degree of end user participation, design process performed, intended use during training, lessons learned), and evaluation (participants, evaluation environment, randomisation, comparison with non-HWD device, main outcomes). If one aspect of a HWD application stood out (e.g., a pedagogic concept was implemented) we took a note and checked if the particular aspect was featured in the other HWD applications as well. Overall, most of the extracted data was qualitative. However, some information was coded in a nominal fashion; for example, we checked if the HWD application was evaluated either in the field, a simulation, or a lab environment.

3. General results
We retrieved 2445 papers across the selected databases and four additional papers through discussions with colleagues. A total of 351 papers (healthcare: 258, industry: 93) met the inclusion criteria. Of these papers 96 (healthcare: 64, industry: 32) were selected for presentation in this survey paper (see Fig. 1). On average, the papers presented were cited 7.38 times per year (healthcare: 6.33, industry: 9.47).

HWD research in healthcare and industry is still a new field with 70% of the papers published within the last 5 years (246/351; see Fig. 2). Note that the charts presented in this paper represent all 351 papers that met the inclusion criteria but, unless stated otherwise, our conclusions and observations in the next sections are based on the subset of 96 papers that are explicitly cited in this survey paper (see Table 3).

4. Applications
To answer RQ1 (Which tasks in healthcare and industrial environments have been supported with HWDs?), we identified seven different categories of HWD applications that have distinct purposes. Table 2 and Fig. 3 illustrate the number of papers that were assigned to each category. The categories are as follows:

1
Manual work guidance: provide instructions and task relevant information

2
Remote collaboration: enable communication with a remote expert

3
Recording and preservation: capture information in the environment

4
Monitoring and notifying: support awareness of changes in the environment

5
Analysing: present information about objects or specific situations

6
Understanding and visualization: enable the interpretation of complex data

7
Controlling: allow the manipulation of technical systems


Table 2. Number of papers per category that met the inclusion criteria or are cited in this survey. Ten of the cited papers were assigned to multiple categories. Therefore, the grand total of papers in the categories (106) is higher than the actual number of papers that were reviewed (96).

Fig. 3. Number of HWD applications per domain and category. The number of training applications is highlighted.

We did not introduce a separate 'Training' category although HWD-supported learning is frequently mentioned in the literature. This is because most HWD training applications resemble HWD applications that are used in authentic work. However, three of the above categories (manual work guidance, remote collaboration, recording and preservation) contain a particularly high number of training applications, as can be seen in Fig. 3. We will therefore describe training applications in these categories in detail.

The papers cited in the following seven subsections are the 96 papers that were selected for presentation in this survey (see Table 3), as described in the previous section. Definitions and differentiations introduced have not been described previously and are based purely on trends that we observed in previous research. Due to the high number of reviewed papers, and to maintain good readability, in the following we provide citations after statements that are informed by 1–5 papers and use numbers to back up statements that are based on more than five papers.

4.1. Manual work guidance
Most applications in both the healthcare (24/64) and the industrial domains (22/32) were classified as manual work guidance applications. Manual work guidance applications guide and support the user during a specific task by displaying task-relevant information. The guidance can be either explicit or implicit (see Fig. 4). Explicit guidance might be provided in form of text or arrows that tell the user what to do. Implicit guidance, in contrast, can be provided by adding information that is not available in the environment, but that is required to complete a task. Both explicit and implicit guidance can be environment-sensitive or -insensitive. Environment-sensitive systems adjust guidance based on the actions of the user or on conditions in the surrounding environment, whereas environment-insensitive systems do not adjust guidance. In the following description of manual work guidance, only applications that support the user during the performance of a task are described. Applications that help users to debug a system or make decisions based on features in the environment are described in the section ‘Analysing’.

4.1.1. Manual work guidance applications in the healthcare domain
In healthcare, most HWD applications for manual work guidance are designed to support clinical staff during surgery (15/24). Implicit user interfaces (17/24) are more commonly used than explicit user interfaces (7/24), but all HWD applications that offer support during surgery have the purpose of precisely guiding surgical procedures, such as making incisions or navigating within the patient's body. The first application of a HWD in surgery that we identified was published by Geis (1996), who successfully used a HWD to view the image of a video endoscope during 74 minimally invasive surgeries. Today, advanced endoscopic HWD systems can display multiple clinical image sources at the same time (Yoshida et al., 2015) or present 3D video streams for enhanced depth perception (Kihara et al., 2012). Aside from endoscopy, HWDs display output from other clinical imaging systems, such as ultrasound (Wu et al., 2014), neuronavigation (Yoon et al., 2017), and microscope (Dutra-Medeiros et al., 2017).

In addition to HWD applications that directly display the output of clinical imaging devices (6/24), there are also applications that further process data attained through clinical imaging and then present them via AR (8/24). Pratt et al. (2018) published a highly-cited paper on how they transformed a computed tomography angiography into a 3D model that could be superimposed before and during surgery onto the skin of the patient via the HWD. Similar HWD anatomy viewers provide additional functionality and explicitly highlight the ideal position for probes (Cutolo et al., 2017) or screws (Chen et al., 2015) or display the trajectory of an endoscope (Bichlmeier et al., 2007) and a neuronavigation system (van Doormaal et al., 2019). If virtual content is projected on the patient, a precise and continuous alignment of real and virtual objects is crucial. To avoid complex alignment processes, researchers have developed applications that further analyse clinical imaging data but do not project content directly on the patient (Sadda et al., 2013; Sauer et al., 2017; Song et al., 2018).

Furthermore, the following papers explore how HWDs could support procedures in non-surgical healthcare environments. For example, HWDs can display the output of an ultrasound system nonspatially (Takeshita et al., 2014) or in AR (State et al., 1994). Further, HWDs show a coherence tomography system (Monroy et al., 2014) and an AR dental model obtained through intra oral scanning (Thoma et al., 2017) so as to guide the data acquisition process. Moreover, during anti-depressant treatment a HWD can project previously recorded magnetic resonance imaging data on the patient's head (Leuze et al., 2018). The visualization is designed to help the physician precisely navigate an electromagnetic coil around the patient's head in order to activate specific areas of the brain that are responsible for mood and behaviour.

Finally, HWDs also present instructions for students during training sessions and highlight specific areas in a simulator environment. For example, Rolland et al. (2005) used implicit AR guidance and projected the shape of a human lung on a manikin to guide intubation. Azimi et al. (2018) relied on explicit AR guidance and highlighted specific areas on a manikin to teach paramedic students how to preform needle chest compressions and how to initiate a direct intravenous line. Leung et al. (2018) displayed holographic hands that students could follow in the air to train the correct performance of surgical procedures. Other HWDs display more traditional media such as videos and presentation slides to teach suturing (Peden et al., 2016) and intubation (Alismail et al., 2019) respectively.

In general, most papers that present HWD applications for manual work guidance in the healthcare domain focus on the description of the use case, implementation details, and experience reports (15/24) instead of on the evaluation of the system in controlled experiments (9/24). However, all reported cases of HWD usage by clinicians in an actual clinical environment while treating a patient were successful (7/7). Positive effects associated with HWDs are potentially higher precision (Pratt et al., 2018) and a more comfortable posture during procedures (Geis, 1996; Takeshita et al., 2014). Negative effects of HWDs are increased durations of procedures (Wu et al., 2014) and a steep learning curve to visually focus on and get used to the HWD (Yoon et al., 2017). Furthermore, clinical papers evaluate accuracy in the alignment of virtual and real objects such as anatomy (Chen et al., 2015; Dumesnil et al., 2016; Song et al., 2018; van Doormaal et al., 2019). External tracking solutions already provide accuracy that is sufficient for surgical procedures (Chen et al., 2015). HWD-based solutions are also promising but less accurate than conventional surgical tracking solutions (van Doormaal et al., 2019).

4.1.2. Manual work guidance applications in the industrial domain
Over one third of the papers (15/32) in the industrial domain propose HWD solutions that support workers during assembly and maintenance procedures. The paper with the most citations per year that is included in this survey was published by Caudell and Mizell (1992) who introduced the term AR and proposed HWDs as a means to reduce errors during aircraft maintenance and assembly. The early AR HWD system could guide aircraft wire bundle assembly by displaying schematics, arrows, and text. In a subsequent evaluation, Curtis et al. (1999) demonstrated the effectiveness of the HWD system, but also encountered multiple technical challenges and acceptance issues.

HWDs support maintenance operations in a variety of industrial systems, such as an armoured personnel carrier turret (Henderson and Feiner, 2009), an industrial sprinkler system (Pringle et al., 2019), and a mobile phone production line (Havard et al., 2016). Some modern systems go beyond traditional step-by-step guides and display further task relevant information, such as real-time sensor readings (Robertson et al., 2018) or historical maintenance data that are stored in digital twin instances: database objects that contain all information available about a specific part (Utzig et al., 2019).

Assembly and production tasks are supported with HWDs by augmenting work pieces in industries such as aviation (Caudell and Mizell, 1992), automotive (Reiners et al., 1999), and painting (Elsdon and Demiris, 2018) during specific phases of a procedure (Henderson and Feiner, 2011). Instead of investigating real industrial tasks, some authors explore the assembly of LEGOⓇ or simple models to study HWDs' capabilities compared with other display devices (Evans et al., 2017; Funk et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2003) or to evaluate different user interfaces (Blattgerste et al., 2018).

Furthermore, “pick-by-vision” HWD systems (Schwerdtfeger et al., 2009) support part picking in warehouses. These HWD applications can help the user navigate to specific shelves (Schwerdtfeger et al., 2009), during the search for the correct item on a shelf (Guo et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2019; Murauer and Pflanz, 2018; Schwerdtfeger et al., 2009; Weaver et al., 2010), and during the placement of collected items in boxes (Guo et al., 2015). Most studies exploring the potential of HWDs for part picking were conducted in laboratory environments or simulated environments (Guo et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2019; Schwerdtfeger et al., 2009; Weaver et al., 2010), but Murauer and Pflanz (2018) also successfully demonstrated HWDs' potential to support part picking during a full shift in a real warehouse.

Similar to healthcare, in the industrial domain HWDs are also used to support training. Although some industrial papers indicate that their specific HWD application design can be used for training novices to perform assembly, maintenance, and part picking tasks (6/22), few HWD applications implement pedagogic concepts and go beyond instructing the user what to do at a certain step within a procedure. One exception is the HWD-based car engine assembly training developed by Werrlich et al. (2018). Their system encourages workers to learn by successively removing visual aids and instructions from the HWD as the training progresses. Another custom HWD procedure training system developed by Funk et al. (2017) allows trainer and trainee to work collaboratively on real and virtual industrial components.

In contrast to papers in the healthcare domain, papers in the industrial domain often explore the difference between conventional (paper, computer display) and HWD-based work guidance systems (8/22). All studies except two (Funk et al., 2016; Schwerdtfeger et al., 2009) demonstrate that during assembly, maintenance, and part picking tasks, HWDs can improve task completion times (Guo et al., 2015; Henderson and Feiner, 2009, 2011; Murauer and Pflanz, 2018; Weaver et al., 2010) and reduce error rates (Guo et al., 2015; Henderson and Feiner, 2011; Tang et al., 2003). Industrial studies that compare different information visualization techniques for HWDs show that there can be advantages of AR user interfaces over nonspatial user interfaces (Blattgerste et al., 2018; Henderson and Feiner, 2009) and of image-based systems over text-based systems (Kim et al., 2019). In some tasks the design of the user interface might have a greater influence on task performance than the form of the display device itself (Kim et al., 2019).

4.2. Remote collaboration
Remote collaboration applications allow two or more individuals to work and solve a task together regardless of their different geographic locations. In remote collaborations, HWDs can either augment the local user's environment based on the remote user's inputs, or HWDs can provide the remote user with an immersive impression of the local user's environment. Most papers in this category follow the first approach and connect a local user via a HWD with a remote specialist who can provide support during decision making processes or during the performance of specific tasks (20/21; see Fig. 5).

4.2.1. Remote collaboration applications in the healthcare domain
HWDs in this category enable remote consultation in surgical settings. In their highly cited paper, Armstrong et al. (2014) describe the use of a HWD-based video conferencing application during diabetic limb salvage surgery that transmits the first-person view of the surgeon to a remote specialist. The remote specialist transmits back a video stream of herself, provides virtual proctoring, and can display relevant clinical literature on the HWD. Other HWD applications also transmit the first-person video to a remote specialist, but as backchannels use either text messages (Datta et al., 2015), annotated screenshots of the local surgeon's video stream (McCullough et al., 2018), or an AR version of the remote specialist's hands (Ponce et al., 2014). HWDs have been used to connect residents with supervisors (Vallurupalli et al., 2013) generalists with specialists (Chai et al., 2015), and donor organ recovery surgeons with implant surgeons (Baldwin et al., 2016). Furthermore, significant research efforts have been undertaken to use HWDs for remote proctoring in developing countries (Datta et al., 2015; McCullough et al., 2018; Pappachan et al., 2014) and in prehospital emergency response contexts (Carenzo et al., 2015; Cicero et al., 2015; Follmann et al., 2019; Schaer et al., 2016).

The papers described below explored the potential of HWDs to facilitate the training of local clinical staff through a remote expert. Common are HWD-based video conferencing applications that allow experienced physicians to remotely observe and instruct the training of clinical skills, such as ultrasound imaging (Russell et al., 2014) or suturing (Brewer et al., 2016). More technically advanced HWD solutions present AR holograms of the trainer's hands in front of the trainee to support procedural training (Wang et al., 2017) or display the trainer's annotation and comments in the patient simulator (Rojas-Munoz et al., 2019).

The studies presented indicate that local users find consultation via a HWD to be useful in different healthcare environments (Brewer et al., 2016; Follmann et al., 2019; McCullough et al., 2018; Rojas-Munoz et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2017) and that remote experts appreciate the HWD systems because they allow them to provide situation specific guidance (Chai et al., 2015; McCullough et al., 2018; Schaer et al., 2016). Issues that occurred during the use of the HWD systems were connection lags (Cicero et al., 2015; Ponce et al., 2014), poor image quality (McCullough et al., 2018; Ponce et al., 2014), and misaligned video due to the HWD's position on the head (Ponce et al., 2014). Furthermore, patient privacy is a concern when transmitting procedures via a HWD over the internet (Armstrong et al., 2014; Chai et al., 2015; Ponce et al., 2014; Vallurupalli et al., 2013). Comparisons of conventional telehealth and decision-support systems with HWDs suggest that HWDs might improve clinical staff's performance but might also increase task completion times (Follmann et al., 2019; Rojas-Munoz et al., 2019).

4.2.2. Remote collaboration applications in the industrial domain
Some ‘Manual work guidance’ applications in the industrial domain also implement video-calling functionality (Robertson et al., 2018; Utzig et al., 2019). Additionally, there are two applications that have the main purpose of enabling remote collaboration. The most highly cited paper in this category (Oda et al., 2015) describes how a remote expert can support a local user during the assembly of an industrial part. The collaborative system is designed so that the remote expert can see and interact with representations of the work pieces in a virtual reality environment. The remote expert's actions and instructions are transmitted to the local user and displayed in AR on the HWD. An evaluation of the HWD application showed that remote collaboration was more effective when supported with an AR user interface instead of with a nonspatial user interfaces. Another collaborative system is proposed by Aschenbrenner et al. (2018) who used a HWD-based video calling system to support the maintenance of a switch cabinet. Their application streams first person video to a remote expert who can place AR annotations in the environment which altered communication patterns between novices and experts.

4.3. Recording and preservation
'Recording and preservation' applications are used to record information in the world. They can track either the user's own work or other people, objects, and properties in the environment. Data collection is often done by recording first person video with the HWD, but custom user interfaces are also tested that allow data entry via gestures. In the clinical literature, many documentation applications are described that support recording and preservation. In contrast, in the industrial literature we did not find applications that have the sole purpose of recording and preserving. However, some applications that guide the user during manual work in the industrial domain also implement recording and preservation functions (Havard et al., 2016; Pringle et al., 2019; Robertson et al., 2018; Utzig et al., 2019).

A highly cited paper in this category describes the use of a HWD for wound documentation (Aldaz et al., 2015). The application supports the user during the whole documentation process. First the patient is identified by scanning a bar code, then by pointing the HWD at the wound and blinking with the eyes, a photo is taken. Finally, by nodding the head, the photo is attached to the subsequent patient record. Further, HWDs are used to document autopsies (Albrecht et al., 2014) and plastic surgery (Sinkin et al., 2016), to transmit patient consultation to a remote scribe who updates the patient record (Odenheimer et al., 2018), and to record the location of abnormalities during cystoscopy (Templeman et al., 2016).

HWDs are also used to record videos of specific events that are educational for residents and students or that allow retrospective reviews and performance assessments. For example, Nakhla et al. (2017) filmed surgical procedures with a HWD and later discussed them in the classroom. McCoy et al. (2019) used a HWD to record emergency staffmembers’ perspective during a simulated mass casualty situation. Students at remote locations could watch the video and learn to make triage decisions for the simulated patients whom they saw in the video. Furthermore, videos produced with a HWD can either be self-assessed (Paro et al., 2015) or evaluated by clinical experts in a student supervisor context (Evans et al., 2016). Although HWD supported video recording and streaming is most common in the surgical contexts described above, Schneidereith (2015) also demonstrated the value of equipping students in a patient simulator with a HWD. The HWD allows instructors to observe situations in the tight physical layout of the simulator that cannot be accessed without the HWD.

Because most applications in this category use the HWD as an advanced video camera (10/12), the evaluation of the video and image quality was the purpose of many studies. The video quality of Google Glass (used in most studies in this category) was found to be sufficient in many contexts (Albrecht et al., 2014; Knight et al., 2015; Nakhla et al., 2017; Paro et al., 2015; Sinkin et al., 2016) but worse than small action (Paro et al., 2015) or reflex cameras (Albrecht et al., 2014). Advantages of HWDs as cameras are the first-person perspective of photos and videos (Evans et al., 2016) and the comfortable fit on the head compared to action cameras (Paro et al., 2015). A disadvantage of HWDs as cameras is their tendency not to record the user's actual field of view. The orientation of the HWD is determined by the orientation of the head and not the orientation of the eyes; this becomes problematic, for example, when keeping the head level and looking downwards, as often the case during surgery (Nakhla et al., 2017). A further disadvantage is the short battery life when recording video (Albrecht et al., 2014; Nakhla et al., 2017; Paro et al., 2015).

4.4. Notifying and monitoring
‘Notifying and monitoring’ applications inform the user about continuous processes in the environment and ideally allow the user to develop and maintain situation awareness. HWD applications can inform the user discretely and continuously (see Fig. 6). Discrete notification systems rely on salient stimuli (alarms) to attract the user's attention if required; continuous monitoring systems provide access to real-time process data, but do not prompt the user to check the data at any point. There are also HWD applications that combine both forms of informing.

Notifying and monitoring applications in the healthcare and industrial domains. a) The HWD continuously provides an anaesthesiologist with the patient's vital signs during surgery (Liu et al., 2010; Liu, David; Jenkins, Simon A.; Sanderson, Penelope M.; Fabian, Perry; Russell, W. John Monitoring with Head-Mounted Displays in General Anesthesia, Anesthesia & Analgesia: April 2010 - Volume 110 - Issue 4 - p 1032-1038 doi:10.1213/ANE.0b013e3181d3e647 Copyright 2021 by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. Reproduced with permission of Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.) b) The HWD informs workers in a factory environment if they enter a dangerous area (Colombo et al., 2019; Republished with permission of Association for Computing Machinery, from Sara Colombo, Yihyun Lim, and Federico Casalegno. 2019. Deep vision shield: assessing the use of HMD and wearable sensors in a smart safety device. In Proceedings of the 12th ACM International Conference on PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments (PETRA '19). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 402–410. DOI:https://doi-org.ezproxy.auckland.ac.nz/10.1145/3316782.3322754; permission conveyed through Copyright Clearance Center, Inc.).

4.4.1. Notifying and monitoring applications in the healthcare domain
Most papers in this category explore the use of HWDs for patient monitoring during surgery (Liebert et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2010; Sanderson et al., 2008; Schlosser et al., 2019). The concept has been promoted by Sanderson et al. (2008) who compared a continuous auditory display and a HWD in the patient simulator to inform anaesthesiologists about patient deterioration. The HWD used in the study displayed vital signs as monochromatic numerics that were updated in real-time. Subsequent studies explored how HWD-based vital sign monitors affect the work of anaesthesiologists (Liu et al., 2010), surgeons (Liebert et al., 2016), and paramedics (Schaer et al., 2016) in the operating room, patient simulator, and prehospital environments respectively. In general, evaluations show that HWDs might help physicians to detect deterioration faster (Liebert et al., 2016) and to look at the patient longer (Liebert et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2010). However, in some situations auditory displays might be more effective than HWDs to inform clinicians about the status of their patient (Sanderson et al., 2008).

Instead of displaying the vital signs of a single patient on the HWD, recent studies have displayed the parameters of multiple patients. These HWD applications could support nurses who are responsible for multiple patients in an intensive care unit (Pascale et al., 2019) or supervising clinicians who oversee multiple surgeries in an operating suite (Schlosser et al., 2019). If multiple patients are monitored, HWDs might improve clinical staffmembers’ situation awareness and lead to a more reliable detection of patient alarms (Pascale et al., 2019; Schlosser et al., 2019) but they also have the potential to distract (Schlosser et al., 2019).

4.4.2. Notifying and monitoring applications in the industrial domain
The most highly cited paper in the ‘Notifying and monitoring’ category proposes a HWD that provides workers in the industrial manufacturing domain with continuous feedback on their posture (Vignais et al., 2013). The system relies on body-mounted sensors to estimate strain on specific regions of the body. If the user moves in a hazardous way, an avatar is displayed on the HWD and body regions that are exposed to a musculoskeletal risk are highlighted in red. Further, HWDs inform users about the status of production lines (Hahn et al., 2018), and warn them when entering dangerous areas in a manufacturing environment (Brending et al., 2016; Colombo et al., 2019).

4.5. Analysing
HWD applications in this category capture information in the environment, analyse the information, and present the results of the analysis. The capture of information can happen automatically via the HWD's camera, via integrated sensors, or users can enter information manually by interacting with the HWD. The result of the data analysis can be the basis for future decisions and actions, but ‘Analysing’ applications do not support the user when executing the actions.

4.5.1. Analysing applications in the healthcare domain
The most highly cited paper in the analysing category presents a HWD application that evaluates and presents the results of rapid diagnostic tests (Feng et al., 2014). Similar applications also use camera or depth sensors in the HWD to analyse the wound size of patients (Dumesnil et al., 2016) or to guarantee the correct administration of drugs (Jonas et al., 2014). HWD applications that require manual data entry by the user often implement decision trees, algorithms, or checklists. For example, the user answers multiple questions that are presented on the HWD. After all questions have been answered, the HWD might show a triage decision (Carenzo et al., 2015; Follmann et al., 2019), a disease diagnosis (Pappachan et al., 2014), or the suggested treatment for a patient (Siebert et al., 2017).

The implementation of ‘Analysing’ applications can be challenging. The automatic analysis of the environment based on camera or sensor data requires extensive image and signal processing (Dumesnil et al., 2016; Feng et al., 2014). Therefore, both papers focus on implementation details instead of on the evaluation of the HWD applications. Furthermore, two randomized controlled trials compare conventional and HWD supported decision support algorithms and demonstrated that HWDs can reduce the number of wrong decisions made (Follmann et al., 2019; Siebert et al., 2017) but also increase decision times (Follmann et al., 2019).

4.5.2. Analysing applications in the industrial domain
In the industrial domain, few applications with similar concepts and functionalities as in the healthcare domain have been implemented. However, Kammel and Leon (2003) have developed a system that automatically analyses the quality of a paint job with a HWD and Ghimire et al. (2016) present a HWD application that supports fault diagnosis of air conditioning units by asking the user questions about the system's behaviour.

4.6. Understanding and visualization
Applications in this category display 3D objects on the HWD to give the user a better impression of their specific properties and functionality or to enhance the realism of simulations. In contrast to ‘Manual work guidance’ applications, ‘Understanding and visualization’ applications do not directly affect the user's actions but allow the perception, analysis, comprehension of content that is not physically available in the environment.

All ‘Understanding and visualization’ applications that met our search criteria were proposed for the healthcare domain. Three different use cases were found. First, HWDs enrich simulations and help medical students to envision stressful clinical environments, by displaying videos of simulated patients under distress in the clinical simulator, which lead to participants feeling more connected with simulated patients (Vaughn et al., 2016). Second, HWDs can supplement medical education by displaying models of organs (Karambakhsh et al., 2019) or by augmenting specimens with annotations (Sugiura et al., 2018). Third, HWDs allow the collaborative inspection of three dimensional clinical imaging data prior to surgery which allows the adequate selection of surgical procedures (Brun et al., 2019).

4.7. Controlling
Finally, ‘Controlling’ applications are used to manipulate technical systems in the environment. Applications in this category propose HWDs as both input and output devices. Input capabilities are required to allow the precise manipulation of the technical system to be controlled; output capabilities are required to provide feedback.

All ‘Controlling’ applications were proposed for the industrial domain, where HWDs are used to improve human-robot-collaboration. Studies have evaluated HWDs that allow the user to program a robot arm to follow a specific trajectory (Quintero et al., 2018) or to pick up and place an object at specific positions (Krupke et al., 2018; Rudorfer et al., 2018). All ‘Controlling’ applications focus on novel ways of entering data into a HWD. Multimodal interfaces that combine speech and hand gestures might be more effective than hardware controllers in some scenarios (Quintero et al., 2018). Further, head orientation control (Krupke et al., 2018) and tangible interfaces (Rudorfer et al., 2018) might also be efficient means to interact with technical systems via HWDs.

5. Design of HWD applications
Having surveyed the different HWD applications in the healthcare and industrial domains, in this section we answer RQ2 (How and for what reasons have HWD applications been designed?). We describe researchers’ rationale and methods when developing HWD applications, and the design dimensions that differentiate them (see Table 4).


Table 4. Aspects of design in the healthcare and industrial domains. Some papers reported multiple rationales for deploying HWDs, multiple interaction forms implemented, or multiple HWDs used.

Advantages and rationale. Researchers in the healthcare and industrial domains report similar sets of HWD features that motivate their research. These features include handsfree operability (9/96), information access independent of location and head orientation (11/96), and ease of switching between environment and HWD image (21/96). Further healthcare motivations are sterility (8/64) and see-what-I-see features (8/64). A unique rationale for industrial applications is the operation of HWDs in tight environments (Curtis et al., 1999; Henderson and Feiner, 2009; Reiners et al., 1999). Most papers that describe AR applications also state stereoscopic vision and the alignment of virtual and real objects as a justification for HWDs (28/96) but fail to point out why other AR technologies that have similar features were not considered. In general, a substantial number of papers (23/96) do not justify HWD deployment, and in some instances it was not clear to us why a specific application was implemented on a HWD instead of on a handheld device or conventional screen.

Design-informing factors and processes. In the healthcare domain, HWD applications are not always purpose-built for the environments in which they are intended to be used and it is common to display desktop user interfaces on HWDs without consideration of the legibility and usability of the software on the smaller screen of the HWD (21/64). The use and evaluation of existing software is not negative per se; however, papers generally did not critically discuss what effects the adaptation of desktop software to a HWD might have had, or whether tools such as Google Hangouts provided all required features in professional clinical environments. If custom software is developed, the HWD application is often described without an explanation of the factors and processes that guided design (56/96). Only two of the papers analysed in the healthcare domain (Cutolo et al., 2017; Karambakhsh et al., 2019) implement user interfaces or user interaction concepts that have been demonstrated to be effective in previous research.

In the industrial domain a higher proportion of papers justifies design decisions and present HWD applications with a user interface inspired by successful previous research (9/32). However, in both the healthcare and industrial domains, authors seldom report that design was guided by user requirements that were systematically elicited (12/96). In the healthcare domain, only two papers report that a user-centred design process was followed to inform the development of a HWD application (Aldaz et al., 2015; Templeman et al., 2016). In the industrial domain demand analysis (Werrlich et al., 2018), design visions (Colombo et al., 2019), design thinking workshops (Murauer and Pflanz, 2018), and pilot tests (Henderson and Feiner, 2009; Schwerdtfeger et al., 2009) were used to guide design.

Spatiality. Beyond the process used to design HWD applications, there is also the consideration of how information is presented to the user. In the healthcare domain, only 31% (20/64) of all applications implement AR concepts, whereas in the industrial domain over 68% (22/32) do. In both domains there are papers that present nonspatial HWD applications, per our definition, but the papers refer to them as AR applications (10/96). As stated above, most of the papers analysed did not justify why an AR or nonspatial HWD user interface was implemented and why content was presented in a specific way (73/96).

Multimodality. In both the healthcare and industrial domains, most HWD applications present information visually only (77/96). If HWD applications also play audio, it is usually to support verbal communication between the user and a remote party (10/17). In the healthcare domain, audio is further used to convey continuous alarms (Song et al., 2018) and discrete alarms (Jonas et al., 2014; Sanderson et al., 2008; Schlosser et al., 2019). In the industrial domain, one HWD application also implements auditory alarms (Vignais et al., 2013), and in two cases spoken instructions accompany AR guidance (Havard et al., 2016; Werrlich et al., 2018).

Interaction. In the healthcare domain, only 38% (24/64) of the papers analysed implement or describe user interaction with the HWD, whereas in the industrial domain 78% (25/32) of the papers do so. If user interaction is implemented, voice commands (17/49) and hand gestures (14/49) are common techniques in both domains for controlling HWDs. In the healthcare domain, HWDs are often also controlled via an integrated trackpad (8/64), whereas in the industrial domain, there are HWD applications that can be controlled indirectly by interacting with the environment (Blattgerste et al., 2018; Funk et al., 2016; Oda et al., 2015; Rudorfer et al., 2018; Tang et al., 2003).

Hardware. In the healthcare domain, Google Glass was the most frequently deployed HWD (34/64). It is used because of its light weight, ease of use, and wireless connectivity (Baldwin et al., 2016; Robertson et al., 2018; Yoon et al., 2017). In the industrial domain, Microsoft HoloLens was the most frequently deployed HWD (10/32). It is used because it is a self-contained unit that allows the stable display of AR content in the environment (Pratt et al., 2018; Sauer et al., 2017; Werrlich et al., 2018). With only few exceptions (Bichlmeier et al., 2007; Sadda et al., 2013), papers do not state why a monocular vs. binocular, or opaque vs. transparent HWD was selected.

6. Comparison of research in the healthcare and industrial domains
To answer RQ3 (What are key similarities and differences between HWD research in the two domains?), in the following section we summarize similarities and key differences between HWD research in the healthcare and industrial domains by discussing the aforementioned findings. Further, we characterize the rationale and values of research in both domains and describe how the different preoccupations of the two research communities affect HWD studies.

In both healthcare and industrial domains, HWDs are used to support tasks with similar properties. Four of the seven categories of HWD use cases contain papers from both the healthcare and industrial domains and there are some HWD applications in the two domains with almost identical design and feature sets. For example, manual guidance applications in the healthcare domain indicate with arrows where screws should be inserted into the patient during surgery (Chen et al., 2015), whereas in the industrial domain a similarly designed application uses arrows to indicate where screws should be removed during the maintenance of a complex machine (Henderson and Feiner, 2009). In the healthcare domain, HWDs support monitoring tasks, for example, by displaying the vital signs of multiple patients in a grid layout (Pascale et al., 2019; Schlosser et al., 2019), whereas in the industrial domain HWDs display similar user interfaces that visualise the status of multiple continuously operating machines (Hahn et al., 2018). Finally, in the healthcare domain, HWDs display the current and the ideal angle of dental tools (Song et al., 2018), whereas in the industrial domain HWDs show the current and the ideal torque of a digital wrench (Robertson et al., 2018). Although the outlined similarities might seem trivial, they show that despite fundamental differences between healthcare and industrial environments, HWD applications developed for the two domains use similar user interfaces to support similar tasks. Thus, design elements that were well received in one domain might be successfully imported into the other domain.

Despite the aforementioned similarities, there are also major differences between the healthcare and industrial domains. Although researchers in both domains pay relatively little attention to design in general, researchers in the industrial domain are more likely to use previous findings to inform the design of consecutive HWD applications (9/32).

Furthermore, in the industrial domain more AR HWD interfaces are implemented (22/32), whereas in the healthcare domain nonspatial HWD interfaces are more popular (44/64). In general, HWD applications in the industrial domain tend to be more sophisticated from an engineering point of view than HWD applications in healthcare. In the industrial domain, all papers describe custom HWD applications that often feature advanced algorithms, user interfaces, or highly integrated systems. In the healthcare domain, in contrast, over 30% (21/64) of the papers utilize software that was not specifically developed for a HWD or for the clinical environment. This does not mean that researchers do not develop advanced and complex technical HWD systems for the healthcare domain, but state-of-the-art and bespoke HWD applications are more common in the industrial domain than in healthcare.

Additionally, HWDs are evaluated differently in the two domains. In the industrial domain, 62% (20/32) of the papers present experiments with at least two conditions whereas in the healthcare domain only 40% (26/64) of the papers do so. However, in the industrial domain only 28% (9/32) of the papers describe the deployment of HWDs in the field, whereas in the healthcare domain 43% (28/64) of the papers do so.

Another difference between the domains is the background of the people who conduct HWD research. In general terms, researchers who explore the potential of HWDs in the healthcare domain are typically clinicians (at least one co-author has a clinical affiliation; 57/64) motivated by the possibility of exploring technical solutions for issues that they experience in their work environment. The fact that researchers are often subject matter experts themselves might explain why user-centred design is seldom reported. Much HWD research is conducted in surgical environments (35/64), where the evaluation of novel technical systems has been common for decades. In line with clinical research traditions, evaluations are valued that show the effect of the new HWD technology in the actual clinical environment. However, it is surprising that in contrast to other research areas in the healthcare domain, only few randomized controlled trials of the use of HWDs have been published (11/64). HWD technology is probably still relatively uncommon to many clinical practitioners and it may be that papers that propose HWD use cases and preliminary evaluations are sufficiently novel to merit publication without the need to be validated through randomized controlled trials.

In contrast to the healthcare domain, research in the industrial domain is usually conducted by academics. HWD research in the industrial domain often appears to be motivated by the urge to deploy the advanced HWD hardware and software in an environment where the technology might be (commercially) valuable and where its practical value can be assessed. For example, Weaver et al. (2010) (p. 1695) state: ‘Ideally, we seek an experimental environment where a wearable computing or ubiquitous computing approach can demonstrate improvements over traditional methods and metrics and still have sufficient sensitivity to show the effect of changes to the interface. In order to interest industry, the application domain should be commercially relevant and of high value. […] Order picking meets all of these requirements.’ Overall, industrial research shares many properties with research in the healthcare domain. However, researchers in the industrial domain generally tend to place greater value on the application of state-of-the art technology than those in healthcare do. Many papers propose novel hardware, algorithms, or user interfaces that have been applied in the industrial domain, but that might also be valuable in other domains. Because of the academic background of researchers investigating industrial domains, many HWD applications are evaluated in laboratory environments by student participants (10/32).

In summary, HWD research in the healthcare domain tends to be primarily problem-driven, it appreciates simple rather than complex technical solutions, and it values evaluations in clinical settings. HWD research in the industrial domain is more technology-driven; in addition to evaluating the value of HWDs in industrial settings it also focuses on the advancement of HWD technology in general.

7. Research directions
In the previous sections, we described how HWDs have been used and how HWD application design has been approached. Furthermore, we compared HWD research in the healthcare and industrial domains. In this section we will review the limitations that we identified in current HWD research and describe directions for future research. Because the HWD use cases described in previous literature are already very diverse, instead of trying to propose additional tasks that may also benefit from HWD support, we provide general suggestions that might be useful to a large group of researchers who work with HWDs. In addition, we focus on one major limitation of previous research; the lack of consideration for HWD application design.

7.1. Advancing HWD application design
The generally minimal consideration of software usability, identified in Section 5, could have several explanations. First some researchers might have carefully studied the needs of potential end users but neglected to report the design process in their publication. Alternatively, some of the reviewed publications might have focused on something else than producing and evaluating a useful HWD application for end users (such as demonstrating certain technical possibilities afforded by HWDs). Finally, it may also be the case that researchers might have been unaware of the potential relevance of user-centred design methodologies to their particular applications and contexts.

The latter would be concerning because poor software design can be a major confound when assessing the effectiveness of HWDs in new environments. If the design of HWD applications is not considered, it is difficult to evaluate the full potential of HWDs as devices. In experiments that compare HWDs with other displays, poor performance might be falsely explained with the general feature sets of HWDs whereas it may instead be a result of the poor usability of the specific HWD application in that context of use. Therefore, in the following we revisit existing design literature (e.g. methods, heuristics, principles, examples, recommendations) that has received little attention in HWD research but that has the potential to help researchers, designers, and developers to make informed decisions about the creation of usable HWD applications. Please note that most of the references below are not part of the 96 papers reviewed in this survey. For an overview of the research presented, and the design question addressed, see Fig. 7.

Fig. 7. Illustration of previous literature that can inform HWD application design. At the top of the figure, questions are outlined that researchers might have before attempting to develop a HWD application. Underneath the questions, resources are listed that can inform HWD design. The resources are arranged based on the how theoretical or applied they are, and which question they address. At the bottom of the figure examples are presented that describe how the resources were used in previous research to develop a HWD application. Note that this figure is indicative in nature and not a comprehensive overview of all available design literature. Other resources might have a higher relevance for a particular HWD research project.

Previous design research suggests that users should be included during the development of a HWD application (Holtzblatt and Beyer, 2014)—not at this stage to develop a successful commercial HWD application but instead to eliminate the confound of “poor design” in evaluation experiments. Good examples of user requirement elicitation to inform HWD application design can be found in Jalaliniya and Pederson (2015) who conducted an ethnographic study to design a HWD based personal assistant for surgeons, Romare et al. (2018) who explored HWD use cases for nurses, and Murauer (2018) who developed a HWD for part picking in collaboration with end users.

When it comes to developing the user interface of a HWD application, there are three families of resources in the literature that can guide design. First, general heuristics, frameworks, and design guidelines can be consulted to inform design, such as Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics for user interface design (Nielsen and Mack, 1994). Although Nielsen's heuristics were originally developed for web and desktop applications, they are also relevant for novel hardware (Norman and Nielsen, 2010) such as HWDs. Furthermore, users’ fundamental understanding of properties and relationships in the world can be another good basis for the intuitive design (Hurtienne et al., 2015) of HWD applications. In addition, many of the 3D user interface guidelines (LaViola et al., 2017) that were originally developed for virtual reality applications also apply to AR HWDs.

Second, there are design guidelines that specifically address HWDs and AR. For example, Motti and Caine (2014a) provide a list of 20 wearability principles and survey what users expect from HWDs (Motti and Caine, 2014b). Dünser et al. (2007) present a list of 8 human computer interaction principles and their impact on AR application design. Similarly Endsley et al. (2017) present 9 design heuristics for AR applications. In addition to design guidelines based on scientific work, there are also custom design guidelines available for specific HWDs from companies such as Google and Microsoft.

Third, there is a broad corpus of research that can be consulted to inform the design of specific aspects of the HWD user interface, such as font size (Renkewitz et al., 2008), content position (Chua et al., 2016; Rzayev et al., 2018), colour (Tanuma et al., 2011), and how attention can be attracted (Mentler and Wessel, 2019) and directed (Biocca et al., 2006). Examples of the application of design principles and basic research to inform HWD application design can be found in Siewiorek et al. (2008) and Evans et al. (2017).

Although HWDs are primarily designed to present information visually, considering other modalities during design such as audition, touch, and smell might also be beneficial. According to Wickens' (2002) Multiple Resource Theory, the multimodal presentation of data on a HWD can enable a more reliable and efficient information exchange, especially during tasks where the user relies heavily on visual sensing. Previous research demonstrates that HWDs that present information both visually and auditorily can convey information more efficiently than HWDs that present information solely visually (Klueber et al., 2019) and auditory alarms might attract attention more reliably than visual alarms on a HWD (Farve et al., 2016). Integrating vibrotactile interfaces into HWDs might be an effective means to attract users’ attention (Cobus and Heuten, 2019) and even olfactory stimuli produced by HWDs could increase the immersiveness of augmented environments (Narumi et al., 2011).

Furthermore, the perceived usefulness of HWD applications also depends on the efficiency of their interaction techniques. Touchscreens or keyboards are not intended to be used to interact with HWDs, so designing usable input methods for HWDs might be even more challenging than displaying data in a meaningful way. To guarantee a good fit between environment and HWD application, it is important not to rely in the first instance on the standard interaction techniques that a specific HWD provides. Instead, in line with Tung et al. (2015), it is important to study the advantages, disadvantages, and the perceived social acceptability of different interaction techniques and to select the most appropriate techniques for the environment where the HWD will be deployed. Lee and Hui (2018) provide an extensive review of interaction methods for HWDs and describe different forms of interaction: on-device, on-body, hands-free, and freehand. For an overview of speech input technologies in healthcare see Kumah-Crystal et al. (2018).

Finally, because some software and hardware combinations work better than others, the selection of HWD hardware should not precede the conceptualisation of the software for the HWD. For example, AR applications are more immersive on binocular HWDs than on monocular HWDs. Gaze-controlled applications can only be implemented on HWDs with an integrated eye-tracker. For an extensive discussion of different properties of HWD hardware and the advantages and disadvantages of different types of HWDs consult Schmalstieg and Hollerer (2016). Additionally, Syberfeldt et al. (2017) provide a list of HWD hardware that is currently on the market and they describe how to select the most appropriate hardware for industrial research projects.

The above are simply preliminary suggestions that are warranted given the paucity of explicit design considerations we see, at least to this point, in the emerging literature examining HWDs in healthcare and industrial contexts. Nevertheless, we hope that the summary of design research presented above and in Fig. 7 is useful to researchers and designers who attempt to develop usable HWD applications.

Moving forward, there is clear scope for future research to actively report on design processes and methods, and critically reflect on the activities, guidelines, and principles that were instructive in the design and development of HWD applications—both for other researchers, to learn from what has worked in the past, as well as for recipients of HWD research to assess whether the presented HWD application was suitable for the proposed environment of use.

7.2. Future HWD research
In addition to a more thorough consideration of HWD application design, in the following we provide three general recommendations for the field of clinical and industrial HWD research to advance. First, there are vastly different definitions of the concept of AR. Because the general label of AR for a diverse suite of systems is here to stay, for the purposes of facilitating the comparability of research studies, it is imperative that papers explicitly identify the definition of AR that has been employed.

Second, in contrast to previous survey papers (Dey et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2018; Kolodzey et al., 2017), we observed a relatively high percentage of papers that featured evaluations of HWDs. This is promising, but randomized controlled trials in both the clinical and industrial environments are still rare. Current evaluations frequently focus on participants' initial impression of HWDs and on comparing handheld devices and HWDs. This is in line with observations by Weaver et al. (2010) (p. 1695) who report: 'As is often the case with new technologies, most user studies compare the status quo to the use of a new device or interface […]. More subtle effects, such as what might occur from a change in visualization or display modality, may be overlooked or go unreported as researchers attempt to show value in the new paradigm itself.' Although the former kind of evaluation was required to establish and justify the young field of HWD research, we argue that it is essential to move beyond basic intervention research.

There is also a need for research to take a more critical stance regarding the deployment of HWDs, canvassing both positive and negative effects of HWDs. In our survey, it is clear that there is a prevalence of positive results, with few exceptions. However, previous experiments have demonstrated that novel technologies such as AR can also have negative effects on work. For example, a tablet based system that superimposed AR annotations on the output of an endoscope significantly reduced the probability of detecting critical complications (Dixon et al., 2013). Furthermore, information on stationary screens might be perceived faster than information on HWDs (Pascale et al., 2018). To avoid unintended consequences of HWDs in healthcare and industry, the field will need to move away from primarily exploring positive effects of HWDs and also focus on problematic issues that are associated with the technology.

Moreover, studies are needed that evaluate the longer-term effects of deploying HWDs and their influence on team performance. We found no papers analysing the longitudinal effects of HWD deployment and no studies except the ones that employed HWDs for remote collaboration investigated the effect of HWDs on colleagues of the wearer.

Third, in addition to a stronger focus on evaluations, future HWD research should give greater consideration to training aspects. This includes the development of HWD applications that implement pedagogical concepts and that go beyond step-by-step instructions, but also the conceptualisation of training for HWD users to support switching between virtuality and reality. Research in other domains has demonstrated that attentional switching can be effectively trained (Pradha et al., 2011). However, whether the effective use of HWDs (especially in dual task situations) can be supported by specific training is unexplored so far.

Interestingly, some of the limitations identified above have also been observed in previous survey papers that were introduced in the beginning of this paper, such as the need for more rigorous evaluations of applications in Kolodzey et al. (2017). We can only speculate why, despite previous encouragements, longitudinal studies are still rare, and the positive effects of HWDs are better studied than negative implications. One potential explanation is that critical, longitudinal research requires more resources and time to conduct. As long as journals and conferences publish basic intervention research, authors might be inclined to continue performing such basic studies. Ultimately, for the field of HWD research to mature, we believe that a more critical review of clinical and industrial HWD studies by journals and conferences will be required prior to their publication.

8. Limitations
This survey paper has several limitations. First, our findings are based on peer-reviewed literature only. Our decision not to include grey literature from companies that offer commercial HWD solutions for healthcare or industry might have excluded unique HWD concepts from review, but those reports would not have been validated through peer review.

Second, excluding the term ‘virtual reality’ from database search terms might have prevented the emergence of papers that would have met the inclusion criteria. However, excluding the term greatly reduced false positives.

Third, our observations and conclusions emerged mostly from a subset of 96 influential and unique papers, instead of from all 351 papers that met the inclusion criteria. By carefully selecting the subset of 96 papers based on specific criteria, we attempted to present the corpus of research as neutrally as possible. However, the analysis of all 351 papers might have produced additional insights.

9. Conclusion
Over the past few years, the number of publications describing the use of HWDs in healthcare and industry environments has increased significantly. In both healthcare and industry, most HWD applications have been developed to instruct users during their work. Furthermore, HWDs are used to support remote collaboration, process monitoring, and environment analysis. In the healthcare domain, HWDs also facilitate documentation and data visualization, whereas in the industrial domain they enable the manipulation of technical systems. Although research in the industrial and healthcare domains seems to be motivated differently, the research in each domain has a high relevance for the other, particularly given the remarkable overlap in types of use cases identified in both domains. A principal contribution of the survey has been to identify seven distinct families of use cases of HWDs (Table 2). The use cases stand as a resource for the field, documenting the current scope and scale of the human activities that HWDs have been deployed to support; they provide a map of the extant design possibilities for HWDs; and they may help researchers locate previous publications relevant to their own HWD research—regardless of the context of their work.

The most significant outcome of this survey is that the design of HWD applications has received little attention in both domains and only a small percentage of papers applied user-centred design processes. As this field of research matures, there is considerable scope for future research to critically consider the design of HWD applications as a legitimate sub-domain for the accumulation of knowledge and best (design) practice. Additionally, given the low number of randomized controlled trials published, future HWD research would benefit from a focus on higher quality evaluations. In particular, there is a need for longitudinal studies, as well as studies that analyse the effect of HWDs on the work environment instead of focusing solely on the wearer of the HWD. In conclusion, both the industrial and healthcare domains support similar use cases with HWDs, yet user centred design and high-quality evaluations are rare and remain open research topics for the field.
