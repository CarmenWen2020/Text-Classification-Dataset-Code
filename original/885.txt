To prevent credential stuffing attacks, industry best practice now
proactively checks if user credentials are present in known data
breaches. Recently, some web services, such as HaveIBeenPwned
(HIBP) and Google Password Checkup (GPC), have started providing APIs to check for breached passwords. We refer to such services
as compromised credential checking (C3) services. We give the first
formal description of C3 services, detailing different settings and
operational requirements, and we give relevant threat models.
One key security requirement is the secrecy of a user’s passwords that are being checked. Current widely deployed C3 services
have the user share a small prefix of a hash computed over the
user’s password. We provide a framework for empirically analyzing the leakage of such protocols, showing that in some contexts
knowing the hash prefixes leads to a 12x increase in the efficacy
of remote guessing attacks. We propose two new protocols that
provide stronger protection for users’ passwords, implement them,
and show experimentally that they remain practical to deploy.

1 INTRODUCTION
Password database breaches have become routine [9]. Such breaches
enable credential stuffing attacks, in which attackers try to compromise accounts by submitting one or more passwords that were
leaked with that account from another website. To counter credential stuffing, companies and other organizations have begun
checking if their users’ passwords appear in breaches, and, if so,
they deploy further protections (e.g., resetting the user’s passwords
or otherwise warning the user). Information on what usernames
and passwords have appeared in breaches is gathered either from
public sources or from a third-party service. The latter democratizes access to leaked credentials, making it easy for others to help
their customers gain confidence that they are not using exposed
passwords. We refer to such services as compromised credential
checking services, or C3 services in short.
Two prominent C3 services already operate. HaveIBeenPwned
(HIBP) [46] was deployed by Troy Hunt and CloudFlare in 2018
and is used by many web services, including Firefox [14], EVE Online [10], and 1Password [5]. Google released a Chrome extension
called Password Checkup (GPC) [44, 45] in 2019 that allows users
to check if their username-password pairs appear in a compromised
dataset. Both services work by having the user share with the C3
server a prefix of the hash of their password or of the hash of their
username-password pair. This leaks some information about user
passwords, which is problematic should the C3 server be compromised or otherwise malicious. But until now there has been no
thorough investigation into the damage from the leakage of current
C3 services or suggestions for protocols that provide better privacy.
We provide the first formal treatment of C3 services for different
settings, including an exploration of their security guarantees. A
C3 service must provide secrecy of client credentials, and ideally, it
should also preserve secrecy of the leaked datasets held by the C3
server. The computational and bandwidth overhead for the client
and especially the server should also be low. The server might hold
billions of leaked records, precluding use of existing cryptographic
protocols for private set intersection (PSI) [29, 36], which would
use a prohibitive amount of bandwidth at this scale.
Current industry-deployed C3 services reduce bandwidth requirements by dividing the leaked dataset into buckets before executing a PSI protocol. The client shares with the C3 server the
identifier of the bucket where their credentials would be found, if
present in the leak dataset. Then, the client and the server engage
in a protocol between the bucket held by the server and the credential held by the client to determine if their credential is indeed
in the leak. In current schemes, the prefix of the hash of the user
credential is used as the bucket identifier. The client shares the hash
prefix (bucket identifier) of their credentials with the C3 server.
Revealing hash prefixes of credentials may be dangerous. We
outline an attack scenario against such prefix-revealing C3 services.
In particular, we consider a conservative setting where the C3
server attempts to guess the password, while knowing the username
and the hash prefix associated with the queried credential. We
Session 6E: Passwords and Accounts CCS ’19, November 11–15, 2019, London, United Kingdom 1387
rigorously evaluate the security of HIBP and GPC under this threat
model via a mixture of formal and empirical analysis.
We start by considering users with a password appearing in
some leak and show how to adapt a recent state-of-the-art credential tweaking attack [40] to take advantage of the knowledge of
hash prefixes. In a credential tweaking attack, one uses the leaked
password to determine likely guesses (usually, small tweaks on the
leaked password). Via simulation, we show that our variant of credential tweaking successfully compromises 83% of such accounts
with 1,000 or fewer attempts, given the transcript of a query made
to the HIBP server. Without knowledge of the transcript, only 56%
of these accounts can be compromised within 1,000 guesses.
We also consider user accounts not present in a leak. Here we
found that the leakage from the hash prefix disproportionately
affects security compared to the previous case. For these user accounts, obtaining the query to HIBP enables the attacker to guess
71% of passwords within 1,000 attempts, which is a 12x increase
over the success with no hash prefix information. Similarly, for
GPC, our simulation shows 33% of user passwords can be guessed
in 10 or fewer attempts (and 60% in 1,000 attempts), should the
attacker learn the hash prefix shared with the GPC server.
The attack scenarios described are conservative because they
assume the attacker can infer which queries to the C3 server are
associated to which usernames. This may not be always possible.
Nevertheless, caution dictates that we would prefer schemes that
leak less. We therefore present two new C3 protocols, one that
checks for leaked passwords (like HIBP) and one that checks for
leaked username-password pairs (like GPC). Like GPC and HIBP,
we partition the password space before performing PSI, but we do
so in a way that reduces leakage significantly.
Our first scheme works when only passwords are queried to
the C3 server. It utilizes a novel approach that we call frequencysmoothing bucketization (FSB). The key idea is to use an estimate of
the distribution of human-chosen passwords to assign passwords to
buckets in a way that flattens the distribution of accessed buckets.
We show how to obtain good estimates (using leaked data), and,
via simulation, that FSB reduces leakage significantly (compared to
HIBP). In many cases the best attack given the information leaked
by the C3 protocol works no better than having no information at all.
While the benefits come with some added computational complexity
and bandwidth, we show via experimentation that the operational
overhead for the FSB C3 server or client is comparable with the
overhead from GPC, while also leaking much less information than
hash-prefix-based C3 protocols.
We also describe a more secure bucketizing scheme that provides better privacy/bandwidth trade-off for C3 servers that store
username-password pairs. This scheme was also (independently)
proposed in [45], and Google states that they plan to transition to
using it in their Chrome extension. It is a simple modification of
their current protocol. We refer to it as IDB, ID-based bucketization,
as it uses the hash prefix of only the user identifier for bucketization (instead of the hash prefix of the username-password pair,
as currently used by GPC). Not having password information in
the bucket identifier hides the user’s password perfectly from an
attacker who obtains the client queries (assuming that passwords
are independent of usernames). We implement IDB and show that
the average bucket size in this setting for a hash prefix of 16 bits
is similar to that of GPC (average 16,122 entries per bucket, which
leads to a bandwidth of 1,066 KB).
Contributions. In summary, the main contributions of this paper
are the following:
• We provide a formalization of C3 protocols and detail the
security goals for such services.
• We discuss various threat models for C3 services, and analyze the security of two widely deployed C3 protocols. We
show that an attacker that learns the queries from a client
can severely damage the security of the client’s passwords,
should they also know the client’s username.
• We give a new C3 protocol (FSB) for checking only leaked
passwords that utilizes knowledge of the human-chosen
password distribution to reduce leakage.
• We give a new C3 protocol for checking leaked usernamepassword pairs (IDB) that bucketizes using only usernames.
• We analyze the performance and security of both new C3
protocols to show feasibility in practice.
We will release as public, open source code our server and client
implementations of FSB and IDB.
2 OVERVIEW
We investigate approaches to checking credentials present in previous breaches. Several third party services provide credential checking, enabling users and companies to mitigate credential stuffing
and credential tweaking attacks [24, 40, 47] , an increasingly daunting problem for account security.
To date, such C3 services have not received in-depth security
analyses. We start by describing the architecture of such services,
and then we detail relevant threat models.
C3 settings. We provide a diagrammatic summary of the abstract
architecture of C3 services in Figure 1. A C3 server has access to
a breach database 𝒮˜
. We can think of 𝒮˜ as a set of size N, which
consists of either a set of passwords {w1, . . . ,wN } or usernamepassword pairs {(u1,w1), . . . , (uN ,wN )}. This corresponds to two
types of C3 services — password-only C3 services and usernamepassword C3 services. For example, HIBP [6] is a password-only
C3 service,1
and Google’s service GPC [44] is an example of a
username-password C3 service.
A client has as input a credential s = (u,w) and wants to determine if s is at risk due to exposure. The client and server therefore
engage in a set membership protocol to determine if s ∈ 𝒮˜
. Here,
clients can be users themselves (querying the C3 service using, say,
a browser extension), or other web services can query the C3 service on behalf of their users. Clients may make multiple queries to
the C3 service, though the number of queries might be rate limited.
The ubiquity of breaches means that, nowadays, the breach database 𝒮˜ will be quite large. A recently leaked compilation of previous
breached data contains 1.4 billion username password pairs [21].
The HIBP database has 501 million unique passwords [6]. Google’s
blog specifies that there are 4 billion username-password pairs in
their database of leaked credentials [44].
1HIBP also allows checking if a user identifier (email) is leaked with a data breach. We
focus on password-only and username-password C3 services.

Figure 1: A C3 service allows a client to ascertain whether
a username and password appear in public breaches known
to the service.
C3 protocols should be able to scale to handle set membership
requests for these huge datasets for millions of requests a day. HIBP
reported serving around 600,000 requests per day on average [7].
The design of a C3 protocol should therefore not be expensive for
the server. Some clients may have limited computational power,
so the C3 protocol should also not be expensive on the client-side.
The number of network round trips required must be low, and we
restrict attention to protocols that can be completed with a single
HTTPS request. Finally, we will want to minimize bandwidth usage.
Threat model. We consider the security of C3 protocols relative
to two distinct threat models: (1) a malicious client that wants to
learn a different user’s password; and (2) an honest-but-curious C3
server that aims to learn the password corresponding to a C3 query.
We discuss each in turn.
A malicious client may want to use the C3 server to discover
another user’s password. The malicious client may know the target’s username and has the ability to query the C3 server. The C3
server’s database 𝒮˜ should therefore be considered confidential,
and our security goal here is that each query to the C3 server can
at most reveal whether a particular w or (u,w) is found within the
breach database, for password-only and username-password services, respectively. Without some way of authenticating ownership
of usernames, this seems the best possible way to limit knowledge
gained from queries. We note that most breach data is in fact publicly available, so we should assume that dedicated adversaries in
this threat model can find (a substantial fraction of) any C3 service’s
dataset. For such adversaries, there is little value in attempting to exploit the C3 service via queries. Nevertheless, deployments should
rate-limit clients via IP-address-based query throttling as well as
via slow-to-compute hash functions such as Argon2 [2].
The trickier threat model to handle is (2), and this will consume
most of our attention in this work. Here the C3 server may be
compromised or otherwise malicious, and it attempts to exploit
a client’s queries to help it learn that client’s password for some
other target website. We assume the adversary can submit password guesses to the target website, and that it knows the client’s
username. We refer to this setting as a known-username attack
(KUA). We conservatively2
assume the adversary has access to the
full breach dataset, and thus can take advantage of both leaked

in-the-clear, and it should instead obfuscate them using an oblivious PRF.
passwords available in the breach dataset and information leaked
about the client’s password from C3 queries. Looking ahead, for
our protocols, the information potentially leaked from C3 queries
is the bucket identifier.
It is context-dependent whether a compromised C3 server will
be able to mount KUAs. For example, in deployments where a web
server issues queries on behalf of their users, queries associated to
many usernames may be intermingled. In some cases, however, an
adversary may be able to link usernames to queries by observing
meta-data corresponding to a query (e.g., IP address of the querying
user or the timing of a request). One can imagine cross-site scripting
attacks that somehow trigger requests to the C3 service, or the
adversary might send tracking emails to leaked email addresses
in order to infer an IP address associated to a username [27]. We
therefore conservatively assume the malicious server’s ability to
know the correct username for a query.
In our KUA model, we focus on online attack settings, where
the attacker tries to impersonate the target user by making remote
login attempts at another web service, using guessed passwords.
These are easy to launch and are one of the most prevalent forms
of attacks [16, 28]. However, in an online setting, the web service
should monitor failed login attempts and lock an account after too
many incorrect password submissions. Therefore, the attacker gets
only a small number of attempts. We use a variable q, called the
guessing budget, to represent the allowed number of attempts.
Should the adversary additionally have access to password hashes
stolen from the target web site, they can instead mount an offline
cracking attack. Offline cracking could be sped up by knowledge of
client C3 queries, and one can extend our results to consider the
offline setting by increasing q to reflect computational limits on adversaries (e.g., q = 1010) rather than limits on remote login attempts.
Roughly speaking, we expect the leakage of HIBP and GPC to be
proportionally as damaging here, and that our new protocol FSB
will not provide as much benefit for very large q (see discussion in
Section 6). IDB will provide no benefit to offline cracking attacks
(assuming they already know the username).
Finally, we focus in threat model (2) on honest-but-curious adversaries, meaning that the malicious server does not deviate from
its protocol. Such actively malicious servers could lie to the client
about the contents of 𝒮˜
in order to encourage them to pick a weak
password. Monitoring techniques might be useful to catch such
misdeeds. For the protocols we consider, we do not know of any
other active attacks advantageous to the adversary, and do not
consider them further.
Potential approaches. A C3 protocol requires, at core, a secure
set membership query. Existing protocols for private set intersection
(a generalization of set membership) [22, 31, 42, 43] cannot currently
scale to the set sizes required in C3 settings, N ≈ 2
30. For example,
the basic PSI protocol that uses an oblivious pseudorandom function
(OPRF) [31] computes yi = Fκ (ui
,wi) for (ui
,wi) ∈ 𝒮˜ where Fκ is
the secure OPRF with secret key κ (held by the server). It sends
all y1, . . . ,yN to the client, and the client obtains y = Fκ (u,w) for
its input (u,w) by obliviously computing it with the server. The
client can then check if y ∈ {y1, . . . ,yN }. But clearly for large N
this is prohibitively expensive in terms of bandwidth. One can use
Bloom filters to more compactly represent the set y1, . . . ,yN , but

the result is still too large. While more advanced PSI protocols exist
that improve on these results asymptotically, they are unfortunately
not yet practical for this C3 setting [30, 31].
Practical C3 schemes therefore relax the security requirements,
allowing the protocol to leak some information about the client’s
queried (u,w) but hopefully not too much. To date no one has investigated how damaging the leakage of currently proposed schemes
is, so we turn to doing that next. In Figure 2, we show all the different settings for C3 we discuss in the paper and compare their
security and performance. The security loss in Figure 2 is a comparison against an attacker that only has access to the username
corresponding to a C3 query (and not a bucket identifier).
3 BUCKETIZATION SCHEMES AND
SECURITY MODELS
In this section we formalize the security models for a class of C3
schemes that bucketize the breach dataset into smaller sets (buckets).
Intuitively, a straightforward approach for checking whether or not
a client’s credentials are present in a large set of leaked credentials
hosted by a server is to divide the leaked data into various buckets.
The client and server can then perform a private set intersection
between the user’s credentials and one of the buckets (potentially)
containing that credential. The bucketization makes private set
membership tractable, while only leaking to the server that the
password may lie in the set associated to a certain bucket.
We give a general framework to understand the security loss
and bandwidth overhead of different bucketization schemes, and
we will use this framework to evaluate existing C3 services.
Notation. To easily describe our constructions, we fix some notation. Let 𝒲 be the set of all passwords, and pw be the associated
probability distribution; let 𝒰 be the set of all user identifiers, and
p be the joint distribution over 𝒰 × 𝒲. We will use 𝒮 to denote the
domain of credentials being checked, i.e., for password-only C3 service, 𝒮 = 𝒲, and for username-password C3 service, 𝒮 = 𝒰 × 𝒲.
Below we will use 𝒮 to give a generic scheme, and specify the
setting only if necessary to distinguish. Similarly, s ∈ 𝒮 denotes a
password or a username-password pair, based on the setting. Let 𝒮˜
be the set of leaked credentials, and |𝒮˜
| = N.

buckets, and we let β : 𝒮 7→ 𝒫 (𝒝) \ {∅} be a bucketizing function
which maps a credential to a set of buckets. A credential can be
mapped to multiple buckets, and every credential is assigned to
at least one bucket. An inverse function to β is α : 𝒝 7→ 𝒫 (𝒮),
which maps a bucket to the set of all credentials it contains; so,
α(b) =

s ∈ 𝒮

b ∈ β(s)
	
. Note, α(b) can be very large given it
considers all credentials in 𝒮. We let α˜ be the function that denotes
the credentials in the buckets held by the C3 server, α˜(b) = α(b)∩𝒮˜
.
The client sends b to the server, and then the client and the server
engage in a set intersection protocol between {s} and α˜(b).
Bucketization schemes. Bucketization divides the credentials
held by the server into smaller buckets. The client can use the
bucketizing function β to find the set of buckets for a credential,
and then pick one randomly to query the server. There are different
ways to bucketize the credentials.
In the first method, which we call hash-prefix-based bucketization (HPB), the credentials are partitioned based on the first l bits
of a cryptographic hash of the credentials. GPC [44] and HIBP [6]
APIs use HPB. The distribution of the credentials is not considered
in HPB, which causes it to incur higher security loss, as we show
in Section 4.
We introduce a new bucketizing method, which we call frequencysmoothing bucketization (FSB), that takes into account the distribution of the credentials and replicates credentials into multiple
buckets if necessary. The replication “flattens” the conditional distribution of passwords given a bucket identifier, and therefore vastly
reduces the security loss. We discuss FSB in more detail in Section 5.
In both HPB and FSB, the bucketization function depends on the
user’s password. We give another bucketization approach — the
most secure one — that bucketizes based only on the hash prefix
of the user identifier. We call this identifier-based bucketization
(IDB). This approach is only applicable for username-password C3
services. We discuss IDB in Section 4.
Security measure. The goal of an attacker is to learn the user’s
password. We will focus on online-guessing attacks, where an atSession 6E: Passwords and Accounts CCS ’19, November 11–15, 2019, London, United Kingdom 1390
tacker tries to guess a user’s password over the login interface
provided by a web service. An account might be locked after too
many incorrect guesses (e.g., 10), in which case the attack fails.
Therefore, we will measure an attacker’s success given a certain
guessing budget q. We will always assume the attacker has access
to the username of the target user.
The security games are given in Figure 4. The game Guess models the situation in which no information besides the username is revealed to the adversary about the password. In the game BucketGuess,
the adversary also gets access to a bucket that is chosen according
to the credentials s = (u,w) and the bucketization function β.
We define the advantage against a game as the maximum probability that the game outputs 1. Therefore, we maximize the probability, over all adversaries, of the adversary winning the game in q
guesses.

The second equation follows because for b ∈ β((u,w)), each bucket
in β(w) is equally likely to be chosen, so
Pr[B = b | W = w ∧U = u] =
1
|β((u,w))| .
The joint distribution of usernames and passwords is hard to
model. To simplify the equations, we divide the users targeted by
the attacker into two groups: compromised (users whose previously
compromised accounts are available to the attacker) and uncompromised (users for which the attacker has no information other than
their usernames).
We assume there is no direct correlation between the username
and password.3 Therefore, an attacker cannot use the knowledge of
only the username to tailor guesses. This means that in the uncompromised setting, we assume Pr[W = w | U = u] = Pr[W = w].
Assuming independence of usernames and passwords, we define in
the uncompromised setting
λq = Advgs(q) = max

Pr[W = wi] . (3)
We give analytical (using Equations 2 and 3) and empirical analysis of security in this setting, and show that the security of uncompromised users is impacted by existing C3 schemes much more
than that of compromised users.
In the compromised setting, the attacker can use the username
to find other leaked passwords associated with that user, which
then can be used to tailor guesses [40, 47]. Analytical bounds on the
compromised setting (using Equations 1 and 2) are less informative,
so we evaluate this setting empirically in Section 6.
Bandwidth. The bandwidth required for a bucketization scheme
is determined by the size of the buckets. The maximum size of the
buckets can be determined using a balls-and-bins approach [20],
assuming the client picks a bucket randomly from the possible set of
buckets β(s) for a credential s, and β(s) also maps s to a random set
of buckets. In total m =
Í
s ∈𝒮˜
|β(s)| credentials (balls) are “thrown”
into n = |𝒝| buckets. If m > |𝒝| · log |𝒝|, then standard results [20]
give that the maximum number of passwords in a bucket is less than

, with very high probability 1 −o(1). We
will use this formula to compute an upper bound on the bandwidth
requirement for specific bucketization schemes.
For HPB schemes, each credential will be mapped to a random
bucket if we assume that the hash function acts as a random oracle.
For FSB, since we only randomly choose the first bucket and map a
credential to a range of buckets starting with the first one, it is not
clear that the set of buckets a credential is mapped to is random. We
also show empirically that these bounds hold for the C3 schemes.
4 HASH-PREFIX-BASED BUCKETIZATION
Hash-prefix-based bucketization (HPB) schemes are a simple way
to divide the credentials stored by the C3 server. In this type of C3
scheme, a prefix of the hash of the credential is used as the criteria
to group the credentials into buckets — all credentials that share
the same hash-prefix are assigned to the same bucket. The total
number of buckets depends on l, the length of the hash-prefix. The
number of credentials in the buckets depends on both l and |𝒮˜
|. We
will use H
(l)
(·) to denote the function that outputs the l-bit prefix
of the hash H(·). The client shares the hash prefix of the credential
they wish to check with the server. While a smaller hash prefix
reveals less information to the server about the user’s password, it
also increases the size of each bucket held by the server, which in
turn increases the bandwidth overhead.
Hash-prefix-based bucketization is currently being used for credential checking in industry : HIBP [6] and GPC [44]. We introduce
3Though prior work [33, 47] suggests knowledge of the username can improve efficacy
of guessing passwords, the improvement is minimal. See Appendix A for more on this.
Session 6E: Passwords and Accounts CCS ’19, November 11–15, 2019, London, United Kingdom 1391
a new HPB protocol called IDB that achieves zero security loss for
any query budget. Below we will discuss the design details of these
three C3 protocols.
HIBP [6]. HIBP uses HPB bucketization to provide a passwordonly C3 service. They do not provide compromised usernamepassword checking. HIBP maintains a database of leaked passwords,
which contains more than 501 million passwords [6]. They use the
SHA1 hash function, with prefix length l = 20; the leaked dataset is
partitioned into 2
20 buckets. The prefix length is chosen to ensure
no bucket is too small or too big. With l = 20, the smallest bucket
has 381 passwords, and the largest bucket has 584 passwords [19] .
This effectively makes the user’s password k-anonymous. However,
k-anonymity provides limited protection, as shown by numerous
prior works [35, 38, 50] and by our security evaluation.
The passwords are hashed using SHA1 and indexed by their hash
prefix for fast retrieval. A client computes the SHA1 hash of their
password w and queries HIBP with the 20-bit prefix of the hash;
the server responds with all the hashes that share the same 20-bit
prefix. The client then checks if the full SHA1 hash of w is present
among the set of hashes sent by the server. This is a weak form
of PSI that does not hide the leaked passwords from the client —
the client learns the SHA1 hash of the leaked passwords and can
perform brute force cracking to recover those passwords.
HIBP justifies this design choice by observing that passwords in
the server side leaked dataset are publicly available for download
on the Internet. Therefore, HIBP lets anyone download the hashed
passwords and usernames. This can be useful for parties who want
to host their own leak checking service without relying on HIBP.
However, keeping the leaked dataset up-to-date can be challenging,
making a third-party C3 service preferable.
HIBP trades server side privacy for protocol simplicity. The protocol also allows utilization of caching on content delivery networks (CDN), such as Cloudflare.4 Caching helps HIBP to be able
to serve 8 million requests a day with 99% cache hit rate (as of
August 2018) [18]. The human-chosen password distribution is
“heavy-headed”, that is a small number of passwords are chosen by
a large number of users. Therefore, a small number of passwords
are queried a large number of times, which in turn makes CDN
caching much more effective.
GPC [44, 45]. Google provides a username-password C3 service,
called Password Checkup (GPC). The client — a browser extension
— computes the hash of the username and password together using
the Argon2 hash function (configured to use a single thread, 256
MB of memory, and a time cost of three) with the first l = 16 bits
to determine the bucket identifier. After determining the bucket,
the client engages in a private set intersection (PSI) protocol with
the server. The full algorithm is given in Figure 5. GPC uses a computationally expensive hash function to make it more difficult for
an adversary to make a large number of queries to the server.
GPC uses an OPRF-based PSI protocol [45]. Let Fa(x) be a function that first calls the hash function H on x, then maps the hash
output onto an elliptic curve point, and finally, exponentiates the
elliptic curve point (using elliptic curve group operations) to the
power a. Therefore it holds that (Fa(x))b = Fab (x).

The GPC protocol is significantly more complex than HIBP, and
it does not allow easy caching by CDNs. However, it provides
secrecy of server-side leaked data — the best case attack is to follow
the protocol to brute-force check if a password is present in the
leak database.
Bandwidth. HPB assigns each credential to only one bucket; therefore, m =

We experimentally verified bandwidth usage, and the sizes of
the buckets for HIBP, GPC, and IDB are given in Section 7.
Security. HPB schemes like HIBP and GPC expose a prefix of
the user’s password (or username-password pair) to the server. As
discussed earlier, we assume the attacker knows the username of
the target user. In the uncompromised setting — where the user
identifier does not appear in the leaked data available to the attacker,
we show that giving the attacker the hash-prefix with a guessing
budget of q queries is equivalent to giving as many as q · |𝒝| queries
(with no hash-prefix) to the attacker. As a reminder, |𝒝| is the
number of buckets. For example, consider a C3 scheme that uses
a 5-character hash prefix as a bucket identifier (2
20 buckets). If
an attacker has 10 guesses to figure out a password, then given a
bucket identifier, they can eliminate any guesses on their list that
don’t belong in that bucket. If their original guesses are distributed
equally across all buckets, then knowing the 5-character hash prefix
can help them get through around q · 2
20 of those guesses.
Theorem 4.1. Let βHPB : 𝒮 7→ 𝒝 be the bucketization scheme
that, for a credential s ∈ 𝒮, chooses a bucket that is a function of

(s), where s contains the user’s password. The advantage of an
attacker in this setting against previously uncompromised users is
Advb-gs
βHPB
(q) ≤ Advgs(q · |𝒝|) .
Proof: First, note that |βHPB(s)| = 1, for any input s, as every
password is assigned to exactly one of the buckets. Following the
discussion from Section 3, assuming independence of usernames
and passwords in the uncompromised setting, we can compute the
advantage against game BucketGuess as

Pr[W = wi] ≤ Advgs(q · |𝒝|) .
We relax the α(b) notation to denote set of passwords (instead of
username-password pairs) assigned to a bucket b. The inequality
follows from the fact that each password is present in only one
bucket. If we sum up the probabilities of the top q passwords in
each bucket, the result will be at most the sum of the probabilities
of the top q · |𝒝| passwords. Therefore, the maximum advantage
achievable is Advgs(q · |𝒝|).
Theorem 4.1 only provides an upper bound on the security loss.
Moreover, for the compromised setting, the analytical formula in
Equation (2) is not very informative. So, we use empiricism to find
the effective security loss against compromised and uncompromised
users. We report all security simulation results in Section 6. Notably,
with GPC using a hash prefix length l = 16, an attacker can guess
passwords of 59.7% of (previously uncompromised) user accounts
in fewer than 1,000 guesses, over a 10x increase from the percent it
can compromise without access to the hash prefix. (See Section 6
for more results.)
Identifier-based bucketization (IDB). As our security analysis
and simulation show, the security degradation of HPB can be high.
The main issue with those protocols is that the bucket identifier is
a deterministic function of the user password. We give a new C3
protocol that uses HPB style bucketing, but based only on username.
We call this identifier-based bucketization (IDB). IDB is defined for
username-password C3 schemes.
IDB is a slight modification of the protocol used by GPC— we use
the hash-prefix of the username, H
(l)
(u), instead of the hash-prefix
of the username-password combination, H
(l)
(u ∥w), as a bucket
identifier. The scheme is described in Figure 5, using the changes
in the boxed code. The bucket identifier is computed completely
independently of the password (assuming the username is independent of the password). Therefore, the attacker gets no additional
advantage by knowing the bucket identifier.
Because IDB uses the hash-prefix of the username as the bucket
identifier, two hash computations are required on the client side for
each query (as opposed to one for GPC). With most modern devices,
this is not a significant computing burden, but the protocol latency
may be impacted, since we use a slow hash (Argon2) for hashing
both the username and the password. We show experimentally how
the extra hash computation affects the latency of IDB in Section 7.
Since in IDB, the bucket identifier does not depend on the user’s
password, the conditional probability of the password given the
bucket identifier remains the same as the probability without knowing the bucket identifier. As a result, exposing the bucket identifier
does not lead to security loss.
Theorem 4.2. With the IDB protocol, for all q ≥ 0
Advb-gs
IDB (q) = Advgs(q).
Proof: Because the IDB bucketization scheme does not depend on
the password, Pr[B = b | W = w ∧U = u] = Pr[B = b | U = u].
We can upper bound the success rate of an adversary in the
BucketGuessIDB game by

The first step follows from independence of password and bucket
choice, and the third step is true because there is only one bucket
for each username.
We would like to note, though IDB reveals nothing about the
password, learning the username becomes easier (compared to GPC)
— an attacker can narrow down the potential users after seeing the
bucket identifier. While this can be concerning for user’s privacy,
we believe the benefit of not revealing anything about the user’s
password outweighs the risk.
Unfortunately, IDB does not work for the password-only C3
setting because it requires that the server store username-password
pairs. In the next section we introduce a more secure password-only
C3 scheme.
5 FREQUENCY-SMOOTHING
BUCKETIZATION
In the previous section we showed how to build a username-password
C3 service that does not degrade security. However, many services,
such as HIBP, only provide a password-only C3 service. HIBP does
not store username-password pairs so, should the HIBP server ever
get compromised, an attacker cannot use their leak database to
mount credential stuffing attacks. Unfortunately, IDB cannot be
extended in any useful way to protect password-only C3 services.
Therefore, we introduce a new bucketization scheme to build
secure password-only C3 services. We call this scheme frequencysmoothing bucketization (FSB). FSB assigns a password to multiple
buckets based on its probability — frequent passwords are assigned
to many buckets. Replicating a password into multiple buckets effectively reduces the conditional probabilities of that password given
a bucket identifier. We do so in a way that makes the conditional
probabilities of popular passwords similar to those of unpopular
passwords to make it harder for the attacker to guess the correct
password. FSB, however, is only effective for non-uniform credenSession 6E: Passwords and Accounts CCS ’19, November 11–15, 2019, London, United Kingdom 1393

tial distributions, such as password distributions.5 Therefore, FSB
cannot be used to build a username-password C3 service.
Implementing FSB requires knowledge of the distribution of
human-chosen passwords. Of course, obtaining precise knowledge
of the password distribution can be difficult; therefore, we will
use an estimated password distribution, denoted by pˆs . Another
parameter of FSB is q¯, which is an estimate of the attacker’s query
budget. We show that if the actual query budget q ≤ q¯, FSB has
zero security loss. Larger q¯ will provide better security; however,
it also means more replication of the passwords and larger bucket
sizes. So, q¯ can be tuned to balance between security and bandwidth.
Below we will give the two main algorithms of the FSB scheme:
βFSB and α˜
FSB, followed by a bandwidth and security analysis.
Bucketizing function (βFSB). To map passwords to buckets, we
use a hash function f : 𝒲 7→ Z|𝒝|
. The algorithm for bucketization
βFSB(w) is given in Figure 6. The parameter q¯ is used in the following way: β replicates the most probable q¯ passwords, 𝒲q¯, across all
|𝒝| buckets. Each of the remaining passwords are replicated proportional to their probability. A password w with probability pˆs (w) is
replicated exactly γ =
l
|𝒝|·pˆs (w)
pˆs (wq¯)
m
times, where wq¯ is the q¯
th most
likely password. Exactly which buckets a password is assigned to
are determined using the hash function f . Each bucket is assigned
an identifier between [0, |𝒝| − 1]. A password w is assigned to the
buckets whose identifiers fall in the range [f (w), f (w) +γ − 1]. The
range can wrap around. For example, if f (w) + γ > |𝒝|, then the
password is assigned to the buckets in the range [0, f (w) + γ − 1
mod |𝒝|] and [f (w), |𝒝| − 1].
Bucket retrieving function (α˜). Retrieving passwords assigned
to a bucket is challenging in FSB. An inefficient — linear in N —
implementation of α˜ is given in Figure 6. Storing the contents of
each bucket separately is not feasible, since the number of buckets
in FSB can be very large, |𝒝| ≈ N. To solve the problem, we utilize
the structure of the bucketizing procedure where passwords are
assigned to buckets in continuous intervals. This allows us to use
an interval tree [8] data structure to store the intervals for all of the
passwords. Interval trees allow fast queries to retrieve the set of
intervals that contain a queried point (or interval) — exactly what
is needed to instantiate α˜.
5Usernames (e.g., emails) are unique for each users, so the distribution of usernames
and username-password pairs are close to uniform.
This efficiency comes with increased storage cost: storing N entries in an interval tree requires 𝒪(N log N )storage. The tree can be
built in 𝒪(N log N ) time, and each query takes 𝒪(log N + |α˜(b)|)
time. The big-O notation only hides small constants.
Estimating password distributions. To construct the bucketization algorithm for FSB, the server needs an estimate of the password
distribution pw . This estimate will be used by both the server and
the client to assign passwords to buckets. One possible estimate is
the histogram of the passwords in the leaked data 𝒮˜
. Histogram
estimates are typically accurate for popular passwords, but such
estimates are not complete — passwords that are not in the leaked
dataset will have zero probability according to this estimate. Moreover, sending the histogram over to the client is expensive in terms
of bandwidth, and it may leak too much information about the
dataset. We also considered password strength meters, such as
zxcvbn [48] as a proxy for a probability estimate. However, this
estimate turned out to be too coarse for our purposes. For example,
more than 105 passwords had a “probability” of greater than 10−3
.
We build a 3-gram password model pˆn using the leaked passwords present in 𝒮˜
. Markov models or n-gram models are shown
to be effective at estimating human-chosen password distributions [34], and they are very fast to train and run (unlike neural
network based password distribution estimators, such as [37]). However, we found the n-gram model assigns very low probabilities to
popular passwords. The sum of the probabilities of the top 1,000
passwords as estimated by the 3-gram model is only 0.032, whereas
those top 1,000 passwords are chosen by 6.5% of users.
We therefore use a combined approach that uses a histogram
model for the popular passwords and the 3-gram model for the
rest of the distribution. Such combined techniques are also used
in practice for password strength estimation [37, 48]. Let pˆs be
the estimated password distribution used by FSB. Let pˆh be the
distribution of passwords implied by the histogram of passwords
present in 𝒮˜
. Let 𝒮˜
t be the set of the t most probable passwords
according to pˆh. We used t = 106
. Then, the final estimate is

Note that instead of using the 3-gram probabilities directly, we
multiply them by a normalization factor that allows Í
w pˆ(w) = 1,
assuming that the same is true for the distributions pˆh and pˆn.
Bandwidth. We use the formulation provided in Section 3 to
compute the bandwidth requirement for FSB. In this case, m =
|𝒝| · q¯ +
|𝒝|
pˆs (wq¯)
+ N, and n = |𝒝|. Therefore, the maximum size of
a bucket is with high probability less than 2 ·

The details of this analysis are given in Appendix B.
In practice, we can choose the number of buckets to be such
that |𝒝| = N. Then, the number of passwords in a bucket depends
primarily on the parameter q¯. Note, bucket size increases with q¯.
Security analysis. We show that there is no security loss in the
uncompromised setting for FSB when the actual number of guesses
q is less than the parameter q¯ and the estimate pˆ is accurate. We
also give a bound for the security loss when q exceeds q¯.

Recall that the probabilities λq are defined in Equation (3). We
include the full proof for Theorem 5.1 in Appendix C. Intuitively,
since the top q passwords are repeated across all buckets, having a
bucket identifier does not allow an attacker to more easily guess
these q passwords. Moreover, the conditional probability of these
q passwords given the bucket is greater than that of any other
password in the bucket. Therefore, the attacker’s best choice is
to guess the top q passwords, meaning that it does not get any
additional advantage when q ≤ q¯, leading to part (1) of the theorem.
The proof of part (2) follows from the upper and lower bounds
on the number of buckets each password beyond the top q is placed
within. The bounds we prove show that the additional advantage
in guessing the password in q queries is less than the number of
additional queries times the probability of the q¯
th password and at
least half the difference in the guessing probabilities λq and λq¯.
Note that this analysis of security loss is based on the assumption
that the FSB scheme has access to the precise password distribution,
pˆs = pw . We empirically analyze the security loss in Section 6 for
pˆs , pw , in both the compromised and uncompromised settings.
6 EMPIRICAL SECURITY EVALUATION
In this section we empirically evaluate and compare the security loss
for different password-only C3 schemes we have discussed so far —
hash-prefix-based bucketization (HPB) and frequency-smoothing
bucketization (FSB).
We focus on known-username attacks (KUA), since in many
deployment settings a curious (or compromised) C3 server can
figure out the username of the querying user. We separate our
analysis into two settings: previously compromised users, where the
attacker has access to one or more existing passwords of the target
user, and previously uncompromised users, where no password
corresponding to the user is known to the attacker (or present in
the breached data).
We also focus on what the honest-but-curious C3 server can
learn from knowing the bucket. In our experiment, we show the
success rate of an adversary that knows the exact leak dataset used
by the server. We expect that an adversary that doesn’t know the
exact leak dataset will have slightly lower success rates.
First we will look into the unrestricted setting where no password
policy is enforced, and the attacker and the C3 server have the
same amount of information about the password distribution. In
the second experiment, we analyze the effect on security of giving
the attacker more information compared to the C3 server (defender)
by having a password policy that the attacker is aware of but the
C3 server is not.

Also reported are the intersections (of users, passwords, and
user-password pairs, separately) between the test dataset entries and the whole breach dataset that the attacker has access to. The percentage values refer to the fraction of the
values in each test set that also appear in the intersections.
Password breach dataset. We used the same breach dataset used
in [40]. The dataset was derived from a previous breach compilation [21] dataset containing about 1.4 billion username-password
pairs. We chose to use this dataset rather than, for example, the
password breach dataset from HIBP, because it contains usernamepassword pairs.
We cleaned the data by removing non-ASCII characters and
passwords longer than 30 characters. We also combined usernamepassword pairs with the same case-insensitive username, and we
removed users with over 1,000 passwords, as they didn’t seem to be
associated to real accounts. The authors of [40] also joined accounts
with similar usernames and passwords using a method they called
the mixed method. We joined the dataset using the same mixed
method, but we also kept the usernames with only one email and
password.
The final dataset consists of about 1.32 billion username-password
pairs.6 We remove 1% of username-password pairs to use as test
data, denoted as T . The remaining 99% of the data is used to simulate the database of leaked credentials 𝒮˜
. For the experiments with
an enforced password policy, we took the username-password pairs
in T that met the requirements of the password policy to create Tsp.
We use Tsp to simulate queries from a website which only allows
passwords that are at least 8 characters long and are not present in
Twitter’s list of banned passwords [11]. For all attack simulations,
the target user-password pairs are sampled from the test dataset T
(or Tsp).
In Figure 7, we report some statistics aboutT ,Tsp, and 𝒮˜
. Notably,
5.9 million (46%) of the users in T are also present in 𝒮˜
. Among the
username-password pairs, 3.2 million (24%) of the pairs inT are also
present in 𝒮˜
. This means an attacker will be able to compromise
about half of the previously compromised accounts trivially with
credential stuffing. In the site-policy enforced test dataTsp, a similar
proportion of the users (46%) and username-password pairs (23%)
are also present in 𝒮˜
.
Experiment setup. We want to understand the impact of revealing a bucket identifier on the security of uncompromised and compromised users separately. As we can see from Figure 7, a large
proportion of users in T are also present in 𝒮˜
. We therefore split
T into two parts: one with only username-password pairs from
compromised users (users with at least one password present in

𝒮˜
), Tcomp, and another with only pairs from uncompromised users
(users with no passwords present in 𝒮˜
), Tuncomp. We generate two
sets of random samples of 5,000 username-password pairs, one
fromTcomp, and another fromTuncomp. We chose 5,000 because this
number of samples led to a low standard deviation (as reported
in Figure 8). For each pair (u,w), we run the games Guess and
BucketGuess as specified in Figure 4. We record the results for
guessing budgets of q ∈ {1, 10, 102
, 103
}. We repeat each of the
experiments 5 times and report the averages in Figure 8.
For HPB, we compared implementations using hash prefixes of
lengths l ∈ {12, 16, 20}. We use the SHA256 hash function with a
salt, though the choice of hash function does not have a noticeable
impact on the results.
For FSB, we used interval tree data structures to store the leaked
passwords in 𝒮˜
for fast retrieval of α˜(b). We used |𝒝| = 2
30 buckets,
and the hash function f is set to f (x) = H
(30)
(x), the 30-bit prefix
of the (salted) SHA256 hash of the password.
Attack strategy. The attacker’s goal is to maximize its success in
winning the games Guess and BucketGuess. In Equation (1) and
Equation (2) we outline the advantage of attackers against Guess
and BucketGuess, and thereby specify the best strategies for attacks. Guess denotes the baseline attack success rate in a scenario
where the attacker does not have access to bucket identifiers corresponding to users’ passwords. Therefore the best strategy for the
attacker 𝒜 is to output the q most probable passwords according
to its knowledge of the password distribution.
The optimal attack strategy for 𝒜′
in BucketGuess will be to
find a list of passwords according to the following equation,
argmax
w1,...,wq
b ∈β((u,wi ))
Õ
q
i=1
Pr[W = wi
| U = u]
|β((u,wi))| ,
where the bucket identifier b and user identifier u are provided to
the attacker. This is equivalent to taking the top-q passwords in the
set α(b) ordered by Pr[W = w | U = u] /|β((u,w))|.
We compute the list of guesses outputted by the attacker for a
user u and bucket b in the following way. For the compromised
users, i.e., if (u, ·) ∈ 𝒮˜
, the attacker first considers the passwords
known to be associated to that user and the list of 104
targeted
guesses generated based on the credential tweaking attack introduced in [40]. If any of these passwords belong to α(b) they are
guessed first. This step is skipped for uncompromised users.
For the remaining guesses, we first construct a list of candidates L
consisting of all 436 million passwords present in the breached database 𝒮˜ sorted by their frequencies, followed by 500×106 passwords
generated from the 3-gram password distribution model pˆn. Each
passwordw in L is assigned a weightpˆs (w)/|β((u,w))| (See Section 5
for details on pˆs and pˆn). The list L is pruned to only contain unique
guesses. Note L is constructed independent of the username or
bucket identifier, and it is reordered based on the weight values.
Therefore, it is constructed once for each bucketization strategy.
Finally, based on the bucket identifier b, the remaining guesses are
chosen from {α(b) ∩ (u,w) | w ∈ L} in descending order of weight.
For the HPB implementation, each password is mapped to one
bucket, so |β(w)| = 1 for all w. For FSB, |β(·)| can be calculated
using the equation in Theorem 5.1.
Since we are estimating the values to be used in the equation,
the attack is no longer optimal. However, the attack we use still
performs quite well against existing C3 protocols, which already
shows that they leak too much information. An optimal attack can
only perform better.
Results. We report the success rates of the attack simulations
in Figure 8. The baseline success rate (first row) is the advantage
Advgs, computed using the same attack strategy stated above except
with no information about the bucket identifier. The following
rows record the success rate of the attack for HPB and FSB with
different parameter choices. The estimated security loss (∆q) can
be calculated by subtracting the baseline success rate from the HPB
and FSB attack success rates.
The security loss from using HPB is large, especially for previously uncompromised users. Accessibility to the l = 20-bit hash
prefix, used by HIBP [6], allows an attacker to compromise 32.9%
of previously uncompromised users in just one guess. In fewer
than 103 guesses, that attacker can compromise more than 70%
of the accounts (12x more than the baseline success rate with
103 guesses). Google Password Checkup (GPC) uses l = 16 for
its username-password C3 service. Against GPC, an attacker only
needs 10 guesses per account to compromise 33% of accounts. Reducing the prefix length l can decrease the attacker’s advantage.
However, that would also increase the bucket size. As we see for
l = 12, the average bucket size is 105,642, so the bandwidth required
to perform the credential check would be high.
FSB resists guessing attacks much better than HPB does. For q ≤
q¯the attacker gets no additional advantage, even with the estimated
password distribution pˆs . The security loss for FSB when q > q¯ is
much smaller than that of HPB, even with smaller bucket sizes. For
example, the additional advantage over the baseline against FSB
withq = 100 andq¯ = 10 is only 2.4%, despite FSB also having smaller
bucket sizes than HPB with l = 16. Similarly for q¯ = 100, ∆103 =
2.2%. This is because the conditional distribution of passwords
given an FSB bucket identifier is nearly uniform, making it harder
for an attacker to guess the correct password in the bucket α(b) in
q guesses.
For previously compromised users — users present in 𝒮˜ — even
the baseline success rate is very high: 41% of account passwords
can be guessed in 1 guess and 56% can be guessed in fewer than
1,000 guesses. The advantage is supplemented even further with
access to the hash prefix. As per the guessing strategy, the attacker
first guesses the leaked passwords that are both associated to the
user and in α(b). This turns out to be very effective. Due to the
high baseline success rate the relative increase is low; nevertheless,
in total, an attacker can guess the passwords of 83% of previously
compromised users in fewer than 1,000 guesses. For FSB, the security loss for compromised users is comparable to the loss against
uncompromised users for q ≤ q¯. Particularly for q¯ = 10 and q = 100,
the attacker’s additional success for a previously compromised user
is only 2.7% higher than the baseline. Similarly, for q¯ = 100 an
attacker gets at most 1.4% additional advantage for a guessing budget of q=1,000. Interestingly, FSB performs significantly worse for
compromised users compared to uncompromised users for q = 1.
This is because the FSB bucketing strategy does not take into acSession 6E: Passwords and Accounts CCS ’19, November 11–15, 2019, London, United Kingdom 1396

count targeted password distributions, and the first guess in the
compromised setting is based on the credential tweaking attack.
In our simulation, previously compromised users made up around
46% of the test set. We could proportionally combine the success
rates against uncompromised and compromised users to obtain an
overall attack success rate. However, it is unclear what the actual
proportion would be in the real world, so we choose not to combine
results from the two settings.
Password policy experiment. In the previous set of experiments,
we assumed that the C3 server and the attacker use the same estimate of the password distribution. To explore a situation in which
the attacker has a better estimate of the password distribution than
the C3 server, we simulated a website which enforces a password
policy. We assume that the policy is known to the attacker but not
to the C3 server.
For our sample password policy, we required that passwords
have at least 8 characters and that they must not be on Twitter’s
banned password list [11]. The test samples are drawn from Tsp,
username-password pairs from T where passwords follow this policy. The attacker is also given the ability to tailor their guesses
to this policy. The server still stores all passwords in 𝒮˜
, without
regard to this policy. Notably, the FSB scheme relies on a good
estimate of the password distribution to be effective in distributing
passwords evenly across buckets. Its estimate, when compared to
the distribution of passwords in Tsp, should be less accurate than
it was in the regular simulation, when compared to the password
distribution from T .
We chose the parameters k = 16 for HPB and q¯ = 100 for FSB,
because they were the most representative of how the HPB and FSB
bucketization schemes compare to each other. These parameters
also lead to similar bucket sizes, with around 6,500 passwords per
bucket. Overall, we see that the success rate of an attacker decreases
in these simulations compared to the general experiments (without
a password policy). This is because after removing popular passwords, the remaining set of passwords that we can choose from
has higher entropy, and each password is harder to guess. FSB still
defends much better against the attack than HPB does, even though
the password distribution estimate used by the FSB implementation
is quite inaccurate, especially at the head of the distribution. The

inaccuracy stems from FSB assigning larger probability estimates
to passwords that are banned according to the password policy.
We also see that due to the inaccurate estimate by the C3 server
for FSB, we start to see some security loss for an adversary with
guessing budget q = 100. In the general simulation, the password
estimate pˆs used by the server was closer to p, so we didn’t have
any noticeable security loss where q ≤ q¯.
7 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
We implement the different approaches to checking compromised
credentials and evaluate their computational overheads. For fair
comparison, in addition to the algorithms we propose, FSB and IDB,
we also implement HIBP and GPC with our breach dataset.
Setup. We build C3 services as serverless web applications that provide REST APIs. We used AWS Lambda [1] for the server-side computation and Amazon DynamoDB [4] to store the data. The benefit
of using AWS Lambda is it can be easily deployed as Lambda@Edge
and integrated with Amazon’s content delivery network (CDN),
called CloudFront [3]. (HIBP uses Cloudflare as CDN to serve more
than 600,000 requests per day [7].) We used Javascript to implement
the server and the client side functionalities. The server is implemented as a Node-JS app. We provisioned the Lambda workers to
have a maximum of 3 GB of memory. For cryptographic operations,
we used a Node-JS library called Crypto [12].
For pre-processing and pre-computation of the data we used a
desktop with an Intel Core i9 processor and 128 GB RAM. Though
some of the computation (e.g., hash computations) can be expedited
Session 6E: Passwords and Accounts CCS ’19, November 11–15, 2019, London, United Kingdom 1397
using GPUs, we did not use any for our experiment. We used the
same machine to act as the client. The round trip network latency of
the Lambda API from the client machine is about 130 milliseconds.
The breach dataset we used is the one described in Figure 7. It
contains 436 million unique passwords and 1,317 million unique
username-password pairs.
To measure the performance of each scheme, we pick 20 random
passwords from the test setT and run the full C3 protocol with each
one. We report the average time taken for each run in Figure 10.
In the figure, we also give the breakdown of the time taken by
the server and the client for different operations. The network
latency had very high standard deviation (25%), though all other
measurements had low (< 1%) standard deviations compared to
their mean values.
HIBP. The implementation of HIBP is the simplest among the four
schemes. The set of passwords in 𝒮˜
is hashed using SHA256 and
split into 2
20 buckets based on the first 20 bits of the hash value (we
picked SHA256 because we also used the same for FSB). Because the
bucket sizes in HIBP are so small (< 500), each bucket is stored as a
single value in a DynamoDB cell, where the key is the hash prefix.
For larger leaked datasets, each bucket can be split into multiple
cells. The client sends the 20 bit prefix of the SHA256 hash of their
password, and the server responds with the corresponding bucket.
Among all the protocols HIBP is the fastest (but also weakest in
terms of security). It takes only 220 ms on average to complete a
query over WAN. Most of the time is spent in round-trip network
latency and the query to DynamoDB. The only cryptographic operation on the client side is a SHA256 hash of the password, which
takes less than 1 ms.
FSB. The implementation of FSB is more complicated than that
of HIBP. Because we have more than 1 billion buckets for FSB and
each password is replicated in potentially many buckets, storing all
the buckets explicitly would require too much storage overhead. We
use interval trees [8] to quickly recover the passwords in a bucket
without explicitly storing each bucket. Each password w in the
breach database is represented as an interval specified by βFSB(w).
We stored each node of the tree as a separate cell in DynamoDB. We
retrieved the intervals (passwords) intersecting a particular value
(bucket identifier) by querying the nodes stored in DynamoDB.
FSB also needs an estimate of the password distribution to get the
interval range for a tree. We use pˆs as described in Section 4. The
description of pˆs takes 8.9 MB of space that needs to be included as
part of the client side code. This is only a one-time bandwidth cost
during client installation. The client would then need to store the
description to use.
The depth of the interval tree is log N, where N is the number of
intervals (passwords) in the tree. Since each node in the tree is stored
as a separate key-value pair in the database, one client query requires log N queries to DynamoDB. To reduce this cost, we split the
interval tree into r trees over different ranges of intervals, such that
the i-th tree is over the interval [(i − 1) · ⌊|𝒝|/r⌋ , i · ⌊|𝒝|/r⌋ − 1].
The passwords whose bucket intervals span across multiple ranges
are present in all corresponding trees. We used r = 128, as it ensures
each tree has around 4 million passwords, and the total storage
overhead is less than 1% more than if we stored one large tree.

Figure 10: Time taken in milliseconds to make a C3 API call.
The client and server columns contain the time taken to perform client side and server side operations respectively.
Each interval tree of 4 million passwords was generated in parallel and took 3 hours in our server. Each interval tree takes 400 MB
of storage in DynamoDB, and in total 51 GB of space. FSB is the
slowest among all the protocols, mainly due to multiple DynamoDB
calls, which cumulatively take 273 ms (half of the total time, including network latency). This can be sped up by using a better
implementation of interval trees on top of DynamoDB, such as
storing a whole subtree in a DynamoDB cell instead of storing each
tree node separately. We can also split the range of the range tree
into more granular intervals to reduce each tree size. Nevertheless,
as the round trip time for FSB is small (527 ms), we leave such
optimization for future work. The maximum amount of memory
used by the server is less than 91 MB during an API call.
On the client side, the computational overhead is minimal. The
client performs one SHA256 hash computation. The network bandwidth consumed for sending the bucket of hash values from the
server takes on average 558 KB.
IDB and GPC. Implementations of IDB and GPC are very similar.
We used the same platforms — AWS Lambda and DynamoDB —
to implement these two schemes. All the hash computations used
here are Argon2id with default parameters, since GPC in [44] uses
Argon2. During precomputation, the server computes the Argon2
hash of each username-password pair and raises it to the power
of the server’s key κ. These values can be further (fast) hashed
to reduce their representation size, which saves disk space and
bandwidth. However, hashing would make it difficult to rotate
server key. We therefore store the exponentiated Argon2 hash
values in the database, and hash them further during the online
phase of the protocol. The hash values are indexed and bucketized
based on either H
(l)
(u∥w) (for GPC) or H
(l)
(u) (for IDB). We used
l = 16 for both GPC and IDB, as proposed in [44].
We used the secp256k1 elliptic curve. The server (for both IDB
and GPC) only performs one elliptic curve exponentiation, which
on average takes 6 ms. The remaining time incurred is from network
latency and calling Amazon DynamoDB.
On the client side, one Argon2 hash has to be computed for GPC
and two for IDB. Computing the Argon2 hash of the usernamepassword pairs takes on an average 20 ms on the desktop machine.
We also tried the same Argon2 hash computation on a personal
laptop (Macbook Pro), and it took 8 ms. In total, hashing and exponentiation takes 47 ms for GPC, and 72 ms (an additional 25 ms)
for IDB. The cost of checking the bucket is also higher (compared
to HIBP and FSB) due to larger bucket sizes.
IDB takes only 28 ms more time on average than GPC (due
to one extra Argon2 hashing), while also leaking no additional
information about the user’s password. It is the most secure among
Session 6E: Passwords and Accounts CCS ’19, November 11–15, 2019, London, United Kingdom 1398
all the protocols we discussed (should username-password pairs be
available in the leak dataset), and runs in a reasonable time.
8 DEPLOYMENT DISCUSSION
Here we discuss different ways C3 services can be used and associated threats that need to be considered. A C3 service can be
queried while creating a password — during registration or password change — to ensure that the new password is not present in a
leak. In this setting C3 is queried from a web server, and the client
IP is potentially not revealed to the server. This, we believe, is a
safer setting to use than the one we will discuss below.
In another scenario, a user can directly query a C3 service. A
user can look for leaked passwords themselves by visiting a web
site or using a browser plugin, such as 1Password [5] or Password
Checkup [44]. This is the most prevalent use case of C3. For example,
the client can regularly check with a C3 service to proactively
safeguard user accounts from potential credential stuffing attacks.
However, there are several security concerns with this setting.
Primarily, the client’s IP is revealed to the C3 server in this setting,
making it easier for the attacker to deanonymize the user. Moreover,
multiple queries from the same user can lead to a more devastating attack. Below we give two new threat models that need to be
considered for secure deployment of C3 services (where bucket
identifiers depend on the password).
Regular password checks. A user or web service might want
to regularly check their passwords with C3 services. Therefore,
a compromised C3 server may learn multiple queries from the
same user. For FSB the bucket identifier is chosen randomly, so
knowing multiple bucket identifiers for the same password will
help an attacker narrow down the password search space by taking
an intersection of the buckets, which will significantly improve
attack success.
We can mitigate this problem for FSB by derandomizing the
client side bucket selection using a client side state (e.g., browser
cookie) so the client always selects the same bucket for the same
password. We let c be a random number chosen by the client and
stored in the browser. To check a password w with the C3 server,
the client always picks the j
th bucket from the range β(w), where
j ← f (w∥c) mod |β(w)|.
This derandomization ensures queries from the same device
are deterministic (after the c is chosen and stored). However, if
the attacker can link queries of the same user from two different
devices, the mitigation is ineffective. If the cookie is stolen from
the client device, then the security of FSB is effectively reduced to
that of HPB with similar bucket sizes.
Similarly, if an attacker can track the interaction history between
a user and a C3 service, it can obtain better insight about the user’s
passwords. For example, if a user who regularly checks with a C3
service stops checking a particular bucket identifier, that could
mean the associated password is possibly in the most up-to-date
leaked dataset, and the attacker can use that information to guess
the user’s password(s).
Checking similar passwords. Another important issue is querying the C3 service with multiple correlated passwords. Some web
services, like 1Password, use HIBP to check multiple passwords for
a user. As shown by prior work, passwords chosen by the same user
are often correlated [24, 40, 47]. An attacker who can see bucket
identifiers of multiple correlated passwords can mount a stronger
attack. Such an attack would require estimating the joint distribution over passwords. We present an initial analysis of this scenario
in Appendix D.
9 RELATED WORK
Private set intersection. The protocol task facing C3 services is
private set membership, a special case of private set intersection
(PSI) [29, 36]. The latter allows two parties to find the intersection
between their private sets without revealing any additional information. Even state-of-the-art PSI protocols do not scale to the sizes
needed for our application. For example, Kiss et al. [30] proposed
an efficient PSI protocol for unequal set sizes based on oblivious
pseudo-random functions (OPRF). It performs well for sets with
millions of elements, but the bandwidth usage scales proportionally
to the size of the leak dataset and so performance is prohibitive
in our setting. Other efficient solutions to PSI [22, 31, 42, 43] have
similarly prohibitive bandwidth usage.
Private information retrieval (PIR) [23] is another cryptographic
primitive used to retrieve information from a server. Assuming the
server’s dataset is public, the client can use PIR to privately retrieve
the entry corresponding to their password from the server. But
in our setting we also want to protect the privacy of the dataset
leak. Even if we relaxed that security requirement, the most advanced PIR schemes [17, 39] require exchanging large amounts of
information over the network, so they are not useful for checking
leaked passwords. PIR with two non-colluding servers can provide
better security [26] than the bucketization-based C3 schemes, with
communication complexity sub-polynomial in the size of the leaked
dataset. It requires building a C3 service with two servers guaranteed to not collude, which may be practical if we assume that
the breached credentials are public information. However, with a
dataset size of at least 1 billion credentials, the cost of one query is
likely still too large to be practical.
Compromised credential checking. To the best of our knowledge, HIBP was the first publicly available C3 service. Junade Ali
designed the current HIBP protocol which uses bucketization via
prefix hashing to limit leakage. Google’s Password Checkup extends this idea to use PSI, which minimizes the information about
the leak revealed to clients. They also moved to checking username,
password pairs.
Google’s Password Checkup (GPC) was described in a paper by
Thomas et al. [45], which became available to us after we began
work on this paper. They introduced the design and implementation
of GPC and report on measurements of its initial deployment. They
recognized that their first generation protocol leaks some bits of
information about passwords, but did not analyze the potential
impact on password guessability. They also propose (what we call)
the ID-based protocol as a way to avoid this leakage. Our paper
provides further motivation for their planned transition to it.
Thomas et al. point out that password-only C3 services are likely
to have high false positive rates. Our new protocol FSB, being in the
password-only setting, inherits this limitation. That said, should
Session 6E: Passwords and Accounts CCS ’19, November 11–15, 2019, London, United Kingdom 1399
one want to do password-only C3 (e.g., because storing username,
password pairs is considered too high a liability given their utility
for credential tweaking attacks [40]), FSB represents the best known
approach.
Other C3 services include, for example, Vericlouds [15] and
GhostProject [13]. They allow users to register with an email address, and regularly keep the user aware of any leaked (sensitive)
information associated with that email. Such services send information to the email address, and the user implicitly authenticates
(proves ownership of the email) by having access to the email address. These services are not anonymous and must be used by the
primary user. Moreover, these services cannot be used for passwordonly C3.
Distribution-sensitive cryptography. Our FSB protocol uses an
estimate of the distribution of human chosen passwords, making it
an example of distribution-sensitive cryptography, in which constructions use contextual information about distributions in order
to improve security. Previous distribution-sensitive approaches include Woodage et al. [49], who introduced a new type of secure
sketch [25] for password typos, and Lacharite et al.’s [32] frequencysmoothing encryption. While similar in that they use distributional
knowledge, their constructions do not apply in our setting.
10 CONCLUSION
We explore different settings and threat models associated with
checking compromised credentials (C3). The main concern is the
secrecy of the user passwords that are being checked. We show,
via simulations, that the existing industry deployed C3 services
(such as HIBP and GPC) do not provide a satisfying level of security.
An attacker who obtains the query to such a C3 service and the
username of the querying user can more easily guess the user’s
password. We give more secure C3 protocols for checking leaked
passwords and username-password pairs. We implemented and
deployed different C3 protocols on AWS Lambda and evaluated their
computational and bandwidth overhead. We finish with several
nuanced threat models and deployment discussions that should be
considered when deploying C3 services.
