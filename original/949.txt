This paper investigates the impact of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) enabled wireless secure transmission. Specifically, an IRS is deployed to assist multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) secure system to enhance the secrecy performance, and artificial noise (AN) is employed to introduce interference to degrade the reception of the eavesdropper. To improve the secrecy performance, we aim to maximize the achievable secrecy rate, subject to the transmit power constraint, by jointly designing the precoding of the secure transmission, the AN jamming, and the reflecting phase shift of the IRS. We first propose an alternative optimization algorithm (i.e., block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm) to tackle the non-convexity of the formulated problem. This is made by deriving the transmit precoding and AN matrices via the Lagrange dual method and the phase shifts by the Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm. Our analysis reveals that the proposed BCD algorithm converges in a monotonically non-decreasing manner which leads to guaranteed optimal solution. Finally, we provide numerical results to validate the secrecy performance enhancement of the proposed scheme in comparison to the benchmark schemes.
SECTION I.Introduction
The fifth-generation (5G) communication networks and beyond have been evolving towards machine-centric driven by a vast range of requirements such as massive connectivity, ultra-low latency, and ultra-high spectral efficiency and throughput. In particular, ultra-high data rates can be supported by a variety of contemporary techniques, e.g., massive multiple-input multiple-output (massive MIMO), relaying, millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, as well as ultra-dense networks (UDNs) [1]–[2][3]. Although these techniques can substantially boost the spectral efficiency, one needs to deal with the increase of computational complexity and hardware cost due to large amount of radio frequency (RF) chains over a high frequency band. In addition, the operation of these techniques often come at a cost of high power consumption due to the increased amount of transmitted data and emission of radio waves [4]. This motivates a novel and promising paradigm, called smart radio environment, which has attracted tremendous research attention in recent years. Smart radio environment offers a seamless wireless connectivity and the capability of processing and transmitting data via recycling the existing radio waves instead of generating new ones [4].

On the other hand, for various civilian and military applications, it has become increasingly important for secured wireless networks to safeguard the private/important information such as credit card transaction, on-line personal data, and military intelligent transmissions [5]. As a matter of fact, wireless security has become an indispensable part of 5G wireless networks. Conventionally, a reliable wireless transmission is secured via traditional cryptographic techniques operating in the network layer. However, this tends to incur large overhead as well as various challenges in terms of key distribution and management to build reliable link due to the nature of wireless transmission [6]. As an alternative approach, physical layer security has been developed to provide the secrecy capacity metric by exploiting information-theoretical fundamentals [5]. In recent years, a variety of resource allocation algorithms have been developed in physical layer security scenarios to improve the secrecy capacity. Additionally, physical layer security has also been studied in multi-antenna scenario [7]–[8][9].

Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), as an enabler for smart radio environments, has been proposed as a novel transceiver-like technique to offer significant performance enhancement in terms of spectrum and energy efficiencies [10], [11]. An IRS is generally consisted of a planar array structure with a large number of reconfigurable passive reflecting elements, which are controlled by a communication-oriented software (e.g. IRS controller) [4], [10]. IRS unlocks a novel wireless device (WD) to achieve three-dimensional (3D) passive beamforming gains by adaptively varying the phase shifts of the reflected signals in time-varying environments [12]. IRS reflecting arrays are generally made of multiple components with small-sized, very low-cost, and low-energy consumption features in which an appropriate phase shift can efficiently improve the reflection of the intended signal without a dedicated RF signal processing, en/de-coding, or re-transmission [10].

A. State-of-the-Art
There has been a rich body of literature on the IRS assisted wireless communication networks [10], [12]–[13][14][15][16]. In [10], an IRS assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) system was proposed, where the desired signals are passively received and reflected by the reflecting elements of the IRS to align the reflection link with the direct link. In [13] a class of active intelligent surface based massive MIMO was investigated by employing an array architecture to passively receive and reflect the desired signals to maximize the total received power targeting to a specific user. Also, multiple IRSs may be flexibly deployed to provide high data rates in the near-field transmission such as indoor environments [14]. In [15], [16], a series of resource allocation algorithms have been developed to jointly design transmit precoding and phase shift matrices in various MIMO scenarios, by maximizing the achievable rate via dynamically adjusting the phase shift at the IRS. From the perspective of security, IRS-aided secrecy system has recently attracted increasing attentions [17]–[18][19][20]. IRS, deployed near the legitimate users, dynamically adjusts the phase shifts to optimize the secrecy performance. In [17], [18], an IRS-aided multi-antenna secrecy system has been investigated, where the achievable secrecy rate is maximized by joint optimization of the secrecy transmit beamforming and reflecting phase shift. The power efficiency optimization problem has been formulated to meet the secrecy rate requirement in [19]. The application of artificial noise (AN) was studied to enhance the achievable secrecy rate in an secure IRS assisted system [20]. Specifically, the integration of AN with IRS can achieve a higher secrecy performance improvement compared with the benchmark schemes. This is due to the fact that an IRS assisted secure system is typically lack of sufficient spatial secure degrees of freedom (DoF) with increasing number of eavesdroppers, such that AN can be an effective means for secrecy performance improvement. In addition, we are interested to compare the IRS aided secure system to other existing secure counterparts, e.g., information-jamming-assisted secure system [21] and the relaying-assisted secure system [22]. Although these conventional transmission systems can enhance the secrecy performance, extra power consumption is needed for jamming and relaying techniques which are considered as external transceivers. The IRS assisted secure system does not need to employ an external transmitter (i.e., information jammer or relay) to generate the new or same radio wave to enhance (degrade) the received power at the legitimate user (eavesdropper) [19]. The existing state-of-the-art only focuses on single-antenna cases at the receive nodes (i.e., legitimate users and eavesdroppers). The formulated problems can be generally relaxed into the semi-definite programming (SDP) to obtain the sub-optimal transmit beamforming and the phase shift via the alternative optimization algorithm. Similar method however may not be applied in IRS aided MIMO secrecy scenario. Besides, there has been few of existing work which exploits the IRS aided MIMO secrecy system, which motivates our work in this paper.

This paper unveils the impact of the IRS on an AN aided MIMO secure system, where the secure transmit precoding, AN jamming as well as the reflecting phase shift matrix of the IRS are jointly designed to enhance secrecy performance. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

We find the optimal joint design of secure transmit precoding matrix, AN jamming matrix and IRS phase shift matrix, to maximize the achievable secrecy rate, subject to transmit power and unit modulus constraints. To deal with its non-convexity, we first transform the original problem into its equivalent form via weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE). Then the problem is further split into three sub-problems by introducing auxiliary variable matrices. We propose a block coordinate decent (BCD) algorithm to alternatively optimize the auxiliary matrices, the transmit precoding, the AN jamming matrix, and the phase shift matrix. In addition, the convergence behaviour of the proposed BCD algorithm is characterized and shown to converge to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the original problem.

We solve the sub-problems with respect to auxiliary variable matrices for the given transmit precoding, AN matrix and phase shift matrix, where their closed-form expressions are derived by taking into consideration the first-order derivatives of these sub-problems.

We then solve the corresponding sub-problem over transmit precoding with AN matrix via the Lagrange dual method, which is derived with the semi-closed-form expressions for given phase shift matrix and auxiliary variable matrices. Also, we perform a bisection search to find the optimal dual variable.

Moreover, the main novelty of our work lies in the optimal design of the phase shift matrix at the IRS. To be specific, for the given transmit precoding, AN matrix and auxiliary variable matrices, we transform the sub-problem with respect to phase shift matrix into a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) with unit-modulus constraint via several matrix/vector manipulations. Due to the non-convex nature of the QCQP problem, we propose a novel method based on the Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm [23] to iteratively find the optimal phase shift of the IRS with a closed-form expression. In addition, we prove the proposed MM algorithm converges to the KKT point.

Finally, numerical evaluations validate the benefits of the proposed algorithm in comparison to the benchmark schemes, with an emphasis on the impact of the IRS on secrecy performance enhancement in the AN aided MIMO secure system. We show that the higher transmit power and larger number of reflecting elements of the IRS will lead to a higher achievable secrecy rate. Additionally, we reveal that the number of antenna at each node and IRS-related link plays an important role in enhancing the secrecy performance.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The secrecy system model is described in Section II, followed by the algorithm design for the IRS aided MIMO secrecy communication with AN in Section III. The IRS aided MIMO secrecy communication without AN is described in Section IV. Numerical results are presented in Section V. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section VI.

SECTION II.System Model
In this paper, we consider a generic IRS assisted MIMO secrecy system as shown in Fig. 1, where a BS intends to establish a reliable communication link with a legitimate user in the presence of single eavesdropper. Also, an IRS is deployed to passively reflect the confidential information from the BS to the receivers (i.e., legitimate user/eavesdropper), each of which generally probes two path superimposed signals from both BS-user/eavesdropper and BS-IRS-user/eavesdropper links. In comparison to the traditional secrecy communication, in our paper, an AN embedded signal is generated by the BS to introduce additional interference to degrade the reception of the eavesdropper by exploiting the IRS-induced extra DoF with the necessity of the AN aided transmit beamformer. Thus, the intended signal to be transmitted at the BS can be written as
x=Ws+z,(1)

We assume that the BS is equipped with NT≥1 transmit antennas, the IRS with NR≥1 reflecting units, the user with NS , and the eavesdropper consists of NE receive antennas. We denote Hbr∈CNR×NT , Hs∈CNT×NS , He,k∈CNT×NE , Gs∈CNR×NS , and GE∈CNR×NE as the channel coefficients between the BS and the IRS, the BS and the user, the BS and the eavesdropper, the IRS and the user, as well as the IRS and the eavesdropper, respectively. In this paper, we assume that the channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropper is available at the BS. This can be achieved through different methods such as the CSI feedback method [24] or even the local oscillator power leakage from the eavesdropper receivers’ RF frontend [25]. The IRS elements collect all multi-path signals at a physical element, and reflect these combined signals via IRS reflecting array. We denote Θ=diag(exp(jα1),exp(jα2),…,exp(jαNR)) , as the diagonal matrix associated with the effective phase shifts in all IRS elements, where αn∈[0,2π],∀n∈[1,NR] is the phase shift at the n -th IRS element.

SECTION III.IRS Aided MIMO Secrecy Communication With AN
A. Problem Formulation
In order to evaluate the secrecy performance of the IRS assisted MIMO secrecy network, we aim to maximize the achievable secrecy rate subject to the transmit power constraint, where the transmit precoding, the AN matrix and the reflecting beamforming are jointly designed. Thus, this optimization problem is formulated as follows:

View SourceProblem (4) is non-convex and intractable. In order to circumvent this non-convex property, we first employ the idea of WMMSE, transforming the objective function in (4) into the equivalent counterpart, which can be designed iteratively via the BCD method [28]. To proceed, we introduce the auxiliary matrices (Xi,(i∈{1,2,3}) , Zj,(j∈{1,2}) ) to reformulate A1 , A2 , and A3 in the objective function in problem (4), respectively. First, let us consider the MSE matrix function of A1 as follows:
E1(Z1,W,V)=(I−ZH1Hs~W)(I−ZH1Hs~W)H+ZH1(I+H~sVVHH~Hs)Z1,(5)
View Sourcethus, A1 is equivalently modified as
A1=maxX1⪰0,Z1log|X1|−Tr[X1E1(Z1,W,V)]+Nd.(6)
View SourceSimilarly, A2 is given by
A2=maxX2⪰0,Z2log|X2|−Tr[X2E2(Z2,V)]+NT,(7)
View Sourcewhere E2(Z2,V)=(I−ZH2H~eV)(I−ZH2H~eV)H+ZH2Z2 . The following lemma is required to deal with A3 ,

Lemma 1:
[26] Denoting E∈CN×N as any positive definite matrix, we have the following function
−log|E|=maxY⪰0δ(Y),(8)
View Sourcewhere δ(Y)=log|Y|−Tr(YE)+N . Then, the optimal solution to problem (8) can be expressed as Yopt=E−1 .

According to Lemma 1, A3 is given by
−A3=maxX3⪰0log|X3|−Tr[X3E3(W,V)]+NE,(9)
View Sourcewhere E3(W,V)=I+H~eWWHH~He+H~eVVHH~He .

Remark 1:
It can be verified that A1 , A2 , and A3 are concave functions with respect to each matrix of W , V , Xi(i∈{1,2,3}) , and Zj(j∈{1,2}) given the other matrices. Also, combining A1 , A2 and A3 provides the lower bound of the achievable secrecy rate Rsec in (2).

We substitute (6)–(9) into (4), which is equivalently rewritten as
maxΩ log|X1|−Tr[X1((I−ZH1H~sW)(I−ZH1H~sW)H+ZH1(I+H~sVVHH~Hs)Z1)]+log|X2|−Tr[X2((I−ZH2H~eV)(I−ZH2H~eV)H+ZH2Z2)]+log|X3|−Tr[X3(I+H~eWWHH~He+H~eVVHH~He)],s.t. Tr(WWH+VVH)≤P,|exp(jαn)|=1,∀n=1,…,NR,Ω={W,V,X1⪰0,X2⪰0,X3⪰0,Z1,Z2,Θ}.(10)
View SourceProblem (10) is still non-convex with respect to the transmit precoding matrices (W , V ), the auxiliary matrices (Xi,(i∈{1,2,3}) , Zj,(j∈{1,2}) ), as well as the phase shift matrix Θ . In the sequel, we propose the BCD algorithm to iteratively update these variable matrices in problem (10). Specifically, problem (10) is separated into the three sub-problems (or sub-iterations), each of which aims to obtain the optimal one (or a group) of variable matrices given others, respectively.

B. Sub-Iteration 1: Optimizing Zj and Xi
In this subsection, we first solve (10) to optimize Zj, (j∈{1,2}) and Xi,(i∈{1,2,3}) given W , V , and Θ . First, (10) is equivalently modified into the following sub-problems over Zj,(j∈{1,2}) as
Z1=Z2=argminZ1Tr[X1E1(Z1,W,V)],argminZ2Tr[X2E2(Z2,W,V)].(11a)(11b)
View SourceIn order to solve (11a) and (11b), we take into consideration their own first-order derivative, respectively, and the closed-form solution of Zj(j∈{1,2}) is given by
Z1=Z2=(I+H~sVVHH~Hs+H~sWWHH~Hs)−1H~sW,(I+H~eVVHH~He)−1H~eV.(12a)(12b)
View SourceNext, we solve (10) to optimize Xi,(i∈{1,2,3}) given W , V , Zj,(j∈{1,2}) , and Θ . It is observed that the matrices Xi,(i∈{1,2,3}) are independent with each other in the objective function of (10). Thus, by exploiting Lemma 1, the closed-form solutions of Xi,(i∈{1,2,3}) is derived as
X1==aX2==bX3=[(I−ZH1H~sW)(I−ZH1H~sW)H+ZH1(I+H~sVVHH~Hs)Z1]−1I+WHH~Hs(I+H~sVVHH~Hs)−1H~sW,[(I−ZH2H~eV)(I−ZH2H~eV)H+ZH2Z2]−1I+VHH~HeH~eV,(I+H~eWWHH~He+H~eVVHH~He)−1,(13a)(13b)(13c)

C. Sub-Iteration 2: Optimizing W and V
In this subsection, we solve problem (10) to optimally design W and V given Xi,(i∈{1,2,3}) , Zj(j∈{1,2}) , and Θ . To proceed, problem (10) is equivalently rewritten with respect to W and V , as
minW⪰0,V⪰0Tr(X1ZH1H~sWWHH~HsZ1)+Tr(X1ZH1H~sVVHH~HsZ1)−Tr(X1ZH1H~sW)−Tr(X1WHH~sZ1)−Tr(X2ZH2H~eV)−Tr(X2VHH~HeZ2)+Tr(X2ZH2H~eVVHH~HeZ2)+Tr(X3H~eWWHH~He)+Tr(X3H~eVVHH~He)s.t. Tr(WWH)+Tr(VVH)≤P.(14)
View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.Problem (14) is a convex problem with respect to W and V , which can be solved via Lagrange dual problem. Let us write the Lagrangian function to problem (14) as follows:
=L(W,V,μ)Tr(X1ZH1H~sWWHH~HsZ1)+Tr(X1ZH1H~sVVHH~HsZ1)−Tr(X1ZH1H~sW)−Tr(X1WHH~sZ1)−Tr(X2ZH2H~eV)−Tr(X2VHH~HeZ2)+Tr(X2ZH2H~eVVHH~HeZ2)+Tr(X3H~eWWHH~He)+Tr(X3H~eVVHH~He)+μ[Tr(WWH)+Tr(VVH)−P],(15)
View Sourceand its dual problem is given by
maxμ≥0minW⪰0,V⪰0 L(W,V,μ).(16)
View SourceIn order to solve the dual problem (16), we consider a two-level algorithm. Particularly, the inner-level problem is considered to optimize W and V for given μ>0 , and the outer level problem is a single-variable optimization problem with respect to μ , which is obtained via one-dimensional search (i.e., bisection method). To proceed, we first solve the inner-level problem to optimize W and V , which can be derived in terms of closed-form expression by taking into consideration the first-order derivative of (15) as
W=V=(μI+H~HsZ1X1ZH1H~s+H~HeX3H~e)−1H~HsZ1X1,(μI+H~HsZ1X1ZH1H~s+H~HeZ2X2ZH2H~e+H~HeX3H~e)−1H~HeZ2X2.(17)(18)
View SourceWe further simplify the solutions of W and V via eigen-decomposition. Specifically, let Σ=H~sZ1X1ZH1H~s+H~eX3H~He and Δ=H~HsZ1X1ZH1H~s+H~HeZ2X2ZH2H~e+H~HeX3H~e , we have the following eigen-decomposition:
Σ=RΛRH, Δ=SΞSH,(19)
View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.where R (or S) denotes a unitary matrix consisting of the orthonormal eigenvectors of Σ (or Δ) and Λ (or Ξ) is a diagonal matrix, each diagonal element of which is the eigenvalue of Σ (or Δ) . Thus, for given μ>0 , the optimal solution of W and V can be re-expressed as
W=V=R(μI+Λ)−1RHH~HsZ1X1,S(μI+Ξ)−1SHH~HeZ2X2.(20a)(20b)
View SourceThen, we solve the outer-level problem to achieve the optimal solution of dual variable μ . With (20a) and (20b), the optimal solution to problem (14) can be obtained by searching the optimal dual variable μ such that the complementary slackness condition holds
μ[Tr(WWH)+Tr(VVH)−P]=0.(21)
View SourceThe optimal solution to dual variable μ can be obtained by performing a bisection search, as it can be shown that the term f(W(μ),V(μ))=Tr(WWH)+Tr(VVH) is a monotonically non-increasing function with respect to μ [26]. The detailed procedure to solve problem (14) is summarized as Algorithm 1. It has been proven in [27] that Algorithm 1 monotonically converges to a KKT point of problem (14).

Lemma 2:
[29] Let C1∈Cm×m and C2∈Cm×m be matrices, and 1=[1,…,1]T be a m×1 vector. Assuming that D∈Cm×m is a diagonal matrix D=diag(d1,…,d2) , and d=D1 , we have the following matrix identities:

In order to tackle this issue, the MM algorithm is employed, and a sequence of tractable sub-problems are considered to iteratively solve problem (30) via approximating its objective function and constraint set [23]. Now, let us first take into consideration the following problem:

In other words, the sub-problem (32) is introduced based on the upper bound of the objective function in (31) via a convex surrogate function, and feasible set in (31) is approximated via convexifications.

Proposition 1:
[30] The objective function (30a) is approximated in the following for any given θ(m) at the m -th iteration and for any feasible θ .
f(θ)=≤θHΦθ+2R{θHq∗}θHΥθ−2R{θH(Υ−Φ)θ(m)}+(θ(m))H(Υ−Φ)θ(m)+2R{θHq∗}=g(θ|θ(m)),(34)

E. Block Coordinate Descent Algorithm
In this subsection, we present the BCD algorithm to solve problem (4) on the basis of above analyses in Section III-B, III-C, and (III-D), which is summarized in Algorithm 3.

Initialization: Maximum iteration number L_{1} ; Precoding \mathbf {W}^{(0)} and \mathbf {V}^{(0)} ; Obtain \mathbf {X}_{i}^{(0)}, (i \in \{1,2,3\}) , \mathbf {Z}_{j}^{(0)}, j \in \{1,2\} via (13a)–(13c) and (12a), (12b), respectively; \kappa is a small value to denote algorithm accuracy.

Repeat:

Given \mathbf {X}_{i}^{(n)} (i \in \{1,2,3\}) , \mathbf {Z}_{j}^{(n)} (j \in \{1,2\}) , \boldsymbol {\Theta }^{(n)} , obtain \mathbf {W}^{(n+1)} and \mathbf {V}^{(n+1)} via Algorithm 1.

Given \mathbf {X}_{i}^{(n)} (i \in \{1,2,3\}) , \mathbf {Z}_{j}^{(n)} (j \in \{1,2\}) , \mathbf {W}^{(n+1)} , and \mathbf {V}^{(n+1)} , obtain \boldsymbol {\theta }^{(n+1)} via Algorithm 2. Calculate \boldsymbol {\Theta }^{(n+1)} = \textrm {diag}(\boldsymbol {\theta }^{(n+1)})

Given \mathbf {W}^{(n+1)} , \mathbf {V}^{(n+1)} , and \boldsymbol {\Theta }^{(n+1)} , obtain \mathbf {Z}_{j}^{(n+1)} (j \in \{ 1,2 \}) via (12a) and (12b), respectively.

Given \mathbf {W}^{(n+1)} , \mathbf {V}^{(n+1)} , \boldsymbol {\Theta }^{(n+1)} , and \mathbf {Z}_{j}^{(n+1)} (j \in \{ 1,2 \}) , obtain \mathbf {X}_{i}^{(n+1)} (i \in \{ 1,2,3 \}) via (13a), (13b), and (13c), respectively.

If \frac {|R_{sec}(\mathbf {W}^{(n+1)}, \mathbf {V}^{(n+1)}, \boldsymbol {\Theta }^{(n+1)}) - R_{sec}(\mathbf {W}^{(n)}, \mathbf {V}^{(n)}, \boldsymbol {\Theta }^{(n)})|}{R_{sec}(\mathbf {W}^{(n+1)}, \mathbf {V}^{(n+1)}, \boldsymbol {\Theta }^{(n+1)})} < \kappa or achieve to the maximum iteration number L_{1} , terminate; Otherwise, n = n+1 and go to step 2.

To proceed, the following theorem is required to analyze the properties of the convergence and the optimal solution shown in Algorithm 3.

Theorem 2:
The objective function value sequence R_{sec}(\mathbf {W}^{(n)}, \mathbf {V}^{(n)}, \boldsymbol {\Theta }^{(n)}), (n = 1,2,\ldots,L_{1}) produces a non-descending trend and can guarantee its solution convergence. Also, the converged solution of the iterative sequences generated via Algorithm 3 is a KKT point of problem (4).

Proof:
Refer to Appendix B.

Theorem 2 indicates that the proposed algorithm monotonically converges to a stationary point of problem (4). The monotonic convergence guarantees an improved objective value with random initialization. Moreover, the computational complexity of the proposed BCD algorithm is analyzed. In Sub-iterations 1, the computational complexity of computing {\mathbf{Z}}_{1} , {\mathbf{Z}}_{1} , {\mathbf{X}}_{1} , {\mathbf{X}}_{2} and {\mathbf{X}}_{3} is \mathcal {O}(2N_{T}^{3}+3N_{E}^{3}) . The computational complexity of Algorithm 1 in Sub-iterations 2 is \mathcal {O}\left ({(N_{T}^{3}+N_{E}^{3})\log _{2}(1/\kappa)}\right) , where \mathcal {O}(\log _{2}(1/\kappa)) is the complexity of dual variable \mu . The computational complexity of the MM algorithm in Sub-iteration 3 is \mathcal {O}(N_{R}^{3}+TN_{R}^{3}) , where T is the iterative number. Finally, the overall computing complexity of the proposed BCD algorithm is \mathcal {O}(L_{1} (2N_{T}^{3}+3N_{E}^{3}+N_{R}^{3}+TN_{R}^{3}+(N_{T}^{3}+N_{E}^{3})\log _{2}(1/\kappa))) .

F. Feasibility Conditions for Positive Secrecy Rate
In this subsection, we check the feasibility conditions that the optimization problem (3) can be solved when it can achieve a positive achievable secrecy rate to validate (3). Hence, we first check whether problem (3) is feasible by taking into consideration the AN jamming matrix \mathbf {Z} \succeq \mathbf {0} satisfying \mathbf {Z} = \frac {\eta P}{N_{T}} \mathbf {I} and \textrm {Tr}(\mathbf {Z}) = \eta P ,2 where \eta \in [{0,1}] . To this end, we conduct the following power minimization problem \begin{align*}&\hspace {-0.5pc}\min _{\bar {\mathbf {W}} \succeq \mathbf {0}, \boldsymbol {\Theta }}~\textrm {Tr}(\bar {\mathbf {W}}), \\&s.t.~\log \left |{ \mathbf {I} \!+\! \hat {\mathbf {H}}_{s} \bar {\mathbf {W}} \hat {\mathbf {H}}_{s}^{H} }\right | \!-\! \log \left |{ \mathbf {I} \!+ \! \hat {\mathbf {H}}_{e} \bar {\mathbf {W}} \hat {\mathbf {H}}_{e}^{H} }\right | \! \geq \! \bar {R}, \\&\hphantom {s.t.~}\textrm {Tr}(\bar {\mathbf {W}}) \leq (1-\eta) P,\tag{38}\end{align*}
View Sourcewhere \hat {\mathbf {H}}_{i} = \mathbf {C}_{i}^{H}\bar {\mathbf {H}}_{i} , \mathbf {C}_{i}\mathbf {C}_{i}^{H} = (\mathbf {I} + \bar {\mathbf {H}}_{i} \mathbf {Z} \bar {\mathbf {H}}_{i}^{H})^{-1},\,\,\forall i \in \{ s,e \} , and \bar {R} > 0 denotes the target secrecy rate for the system. Provided problem (38) is feasible, the positive achievable secrecy rate can be obtained. Now, let us solve problem (38) to optimize \bar {\mathbf {W}} and \boldsymbol {\Theta } alternatively to achieve a sub-optimal solution. To proceed, we divide (38) into the two following subproblems to optimize \bar {\mathbf {W}} and \boldsymbol {\Theta } separately,

Optimize \bar {\mathbf {W}} for given \boldsymbol {\Theta } :\begin{align*}&\min _{\bar {\mathbf {W}} \succeq \mathbf {0}}~\textrm {Tr}(\bar {\mathbf {W}}), \\&s.t.~\log \left |{ \mathbf {I} \!+\! \hat {\mathbf {H}}_{s} \bar {\mathbf {W}} \hat {\mathbf {H}}_{s}^{H} }\right | \!-\! \log \left |{ \mathbf {I} \!+\! \hat {\mathbf {H}}_{e} \bar {\mathbf {W}} \hat {\mathbf {H}}_{e}^{H} }\right | \! \geq \! \bar {R}, \\&\hphantom {s.t.~}\textrm {Tr}(\bar {\mathbf {W}}) \! \leq \! (1 \!-\! \eta) P.\tag{39}\end{align*}

Optimize \boldsymbol {\Theta } for given \bar {\mathbf {W}} : The sub-problem can be equivalently reformulated as problem (30) [10], which can be solved via the MM algorithm shown in Section III-D.

Thus, we solve problems (39) and (30) alternatively until convergence.
SECTION IV.Benchmark Scheme: IRS Aided MIMO Secrecy Communication Without AN
In this section, we consider a benchmark scheme, i.e., IRS aided MIMO secrecy communication without AN. In this scenario, the intended signal is expressed as \mathbf {x} = \mathbf {W}\mathbf {s} , and the achievable secrecy rate is given by \begin{align*} \bar {R}_{sec}(\mathbf {W}, \boldsymbol {\Theta })=&\Biggl [{ \log \left |{ \mathbf {I} + \tilde {\mathbf {H}}_{s} \mathbf {W}\mathbf {W}^{H} \tilde {\mathbf {H}}_{s}^{H} }\right | } \\& {- \log \left |{ \mathbf {I} + \tilde {\mathbf {H}}_{e} \mathbf {W}\mathbf {W}^{H} \tilde {\mathbf {H}}_{e}^{H} }\right | }\Biggr]^{+}.\tag{40}\end{align*}
View SourceThus, its secrecy rate maximization problem is written as \begin{align*}&\max _{\mathbf {W}, \boldsymbol {\Theta }} ~\bar {R}_{sec}, \\&s.t.~\textrm {Tr}(\mathbf {W}\mathbf {W}^{H}) \! \leq \! P, |\exp (j \alpha _{n})| \! = \! 1, \forall n \! = \! 1,\ldots,N_{R}.\tag{41}\end{align*}
View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.According to the idea of WMMSE transformation and Lemma 1 shown in Section III-A, problem (41) can be equivalently modified as \begin{align*}&\hspace {-0.5pc}\max _{ \substack { \mathbf {W},\mathbf {X}_{1} \\ \mathbf {X}_{2}, \mathbf {Z}_{1}, \boldsymbol {\Theta } } } ~ \log \left |{ \mathbf {X}_{1} }\right | \!-\! \textrm {Tr}\Biggl [{ \mathbf {X}_{1} \Biggl ({(\mathbf {I} \!-\! \mathbf {Z}_{1}^{H} \tilde {\mathbf {H}}_{s} \mathbf {W})(\mathbf {I} \!-\! \mathbf {Z}_{1}^{H} \tilde {\mathbf {H}}_{s} \mathbf {W})^{H} }} \\&\quad {{ +\, \mathbf {Z}_{1}^{H} \mathbf {Z}_{1} }\Biggr) }\Biggr] \!+\! \log | \mathbf {X}_{2} | \!-\! \textrm {Tr}\left [{ \mathbf {X}_{2} (\mathbf {I} \!+\! \tilde {\mathbf {H}}_{e} \mathbf {W}\mathbf {W}^{H}\tilde {\mathbf {H}}_{e}^{H}) }\right].\tag{42}\end{align*}
View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.Similar to the mathematical manipulations shown in Section III-B–Section III-D, we can derive the optimal solutions for \mathbf {Z_{1}} , \mathbf {X}_{i} (i \in \{1,2\}) , \mathbf {W} , and \boldsymbol {\Theta } . The BCD algorithm in Algorithm 3 is similarly considered to deal with problem (42). Specifically, at each iteration, \mathbf {W} is first updated for given \mathbf {X}_{i} (i \in \{1,2\}) , \mathbf {Z}_{1} , and \boldsymbol {\Theta } which is obtained via solving problem (42) similar to Algorithm 1. Next, \boldsymbol {\Theta } is updated for given \mathbf {W} , \mathbf {X}_{i} (i \in \{1,2\}) , and \mathbf {Z}_{1} via the MM algorithm similar to Algorithm 2. Then, \mathbf {X}_{i} (i \in \{1,2\}) and \mathbf {Z}_{1} are updated, respectively, in terms of closed-form expressions for given \mathbf {W} and \boldsymbol {\Theta } . It can be shown that the objective value sequence generated by the BCD algorithm employed to solve problem (42) produces a monotonically non-decreasing trend and its solution is guaranteed to converge to satisfy the KKT conditions of problem (41).

SECTION V.Simulation Results
In this section, the simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The system deployment is shown in Fig. 2, where the 3-D coordinates of the BS, the IRS, the legitimate user, and the eavesdropper are (0, 5, 10), (100, 0, 2), (100, 3, 0), and (90, 2, 0) in meter (m), respectively. It is assumed that the BS is equipped with N_{T} = 5 transmit antennas, the number of the reflecting elements at the IRS is N_{R} = 30 , and the legitimate user and the eavesdropper consist of N_{S} = 4 and N_{E} = 3 receive antennas, respectively, unless otherwise specified. All small-scale channel coefficients are generated as the identical and circularly complex Gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit variance. Moreover, the large-scale path loss depends upon the distance between any two nodes, which is expressed as \textrm {PL} = A \left ({\frac {d}{d_{0}} }\right)^{-\beta } , where A = -30\,\,\textrm {dB} denotes the path loss at the reference distance d_{0} = 1\,\,\textrm {m} , and d denotes the distance of the communication link between the BS and the IRS (i.e., d_{BS-IRS} ), the BS and the legitimate user (i.e., d_{BS-user} ), the BS and the eavesdropper (i.e., d_{BS-eve} ), the IRS and the legitimate user (i.e., d_{IRS-user} ), and the IRS and the eavesdropper (i.e., d_{IRS-eve} ), all of which can be calculated based on the coordinates shown in Fig. 2. In addition, the path loss exponents of the BS-IRS link, the BS-user link, the BS-eve link, the IRS-use link and the IRS-eve link are set to \beta _{BS-IRS} = 2.5 , \beta _{BS-user} = \beta _{BS-eve} = 4 , and \beta _{IRS-user} = \beta _{BS-eve} = 2 , respectively, unless otherwise specified. The noise power are set to be \sigma _{s}^{2} = \sigma _{e}^{2} = -105\,\,\textrm {dBm} , unless otherwise specified.

First, we evaluate the convergence properties of the BCD algorithm with different transmit powers P and different reflecting elements N_{R} in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, respectively. From these two figures, it is observed that the achievable secrecy rate has an non-decreasing trend with iteration, and the BCD algorithm achieves the convergence less than 10 iterations in most cases, which validates Theorem 2. In addition, larger transmit power or larger size reflecting elements plays a positive role to increase the achievable secrecy rate.

To demonstrate the advantage of the proposed scheme (denoted by “MIMO IRS with AN” in the simulation results), we include the following three baseline schemes for comparison:

Baseline 1 [17]: We consider an IRS aided MIMO secrecy system without the aided of AN, (i.e., \mathbf {Z} = \mathbf {0} ) where the secure precoding and the phase shift matrices are jointly optimized via the BCD algorithm. This scheme is denoted as “MIMO IRS without AN”.

Baseline 2 [26], [27]: The secrecy precording and the AN precoding are jointly designed without the aided of the IRS in the MIMO secrecy system, which is denoted as “MIMO with AN and without IRS”.

Baseline 3 [6]: We consider a classic MIMO wiretap channel without the aided of the AN and the IRS, which is denoted by “MIMO without AN and without IRS”.

Next, we evaluate the achievable secrecy rate performance versus the maximum transmit power P in Fig. 5. One can observe from the figure that achievable secrecy rate increases with the maximum transmit power P , which confirms the property shown in Fig. 3. Also, we observe that the proposed scheme outperforms the other three baseline schemes,3 manifesting the positive role played by the IRS to enhance the achievable secrecy performance.4 Moreover, the scheme with AN and without IRS slightly outperforms that without AN and IRS. This is due to the fact that the power allocation of AN may not be sufficient to significantly improve the achievable secrecy rate such that the AN only introduce a slight secrecy performance improvement. However, it is evident that IRS achieves a better secrecy performance than its counterpart without AN.

Fig. 6 shows that the achievable secrecy rate performance versus the number of the BS transmit antenna N_{T} , where it can be easily observed that a larger number of the BS transmit antenna leads to a higher achievable secrecy rate. Additionally, similar behaviour and conclusion from Fig. 5 are also observed here with different BS transmit antennas N_{T} . Fig. 7 describes the impact of the number of eavesdropper antenna N_{E} on the achievable secrecy rate performance. As expected, the achievable secrecy rate has a decreasing trend with the number of eavesdropper antenna N_{E} . Moreover, the proposed scheme has an better performance than other three baseline schemes due to the positive impact from the AN and the IRS.

In Fig. 8, we evaluate the achievable secrecy rate performance versus the reflecting elements at the IRS N_{R} . With the help of IRS, the achievable secrecy rate exhibits an increasing behaviour with the reflecting elements N_{R} , whereas the schemes without IRS remains constant with N_{R} in terms of the achievable secrecy rate. This is due to the fact that a larger number of reflecting elements brings a higher DoF to optimize secrecy performance, and a more constructive reflecting signal is produced to enhance the reception at the legitimate user. In addition, the performance gain between the IRS-aided schemes5 and the schemes without IRS6 becomes larger, which highlights the advantage of the IRS via joint optimization of the secure transmit precoding, the AN matrix and the phase shift matrix.

Finally, we evaluate the impact of the path loss exponent of the reflecting link (i.e., the IRS-user/eve link) at the IRS on the achievable secrecy rate performance. It aims to investigates the impact of the large-scale fading channel in the reflecting link on the secrecy system performance. Fig. 9 shows the achievable secrecy rate versus the path loss exponent of the IRS-user link \beta _{IRS-user} . It is apparent from the figure that the achievable secrecy rate exhibits a decreasing trend with \beta _{IRS-user} , owing to the fact that a larger-scale fading will result in a weaker signal reflected from the IRS, diminishing the benefits of the IRS. Additionally, the achievable secrecy rate versus the path loss exponent of the IRS-eve link \beta _{IRS-eve} is shown in Fig. 10, where we observe that the achievable secrecy rate increases with \beta _{IRS-eve} . This follows from the fact that the weaker reflecting signal is introduced to degrade the reception at the eavesdropper with large-scale fading channel between the IRS and the eavesdropper. Actually, these two figures reveal an engineering insights that the IRS should be carefully deployed to enhance the system’s secrecy performance with less blocking objects in the legitimate link or more blocking objects in the eavesdropping link.

SECTION VI.Conclusion
This paper investigated the IRS aided secure MIMO wireless networks, where the secure precoder, the AN jamming precoder and the phase shift matrix at the IRS have been jointly designed to maximize the achievable secrecy rate with the required transmit power budget. Due to the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we proposed a BCD algorithm to alternatively optimize the secure precoder, the AN jamming precoder and the phase shift matrix. Specifically, we derived the closed-form expression of the secure precoder and the AN jamming precoder via the WMMSE algorithm and KKT conditions, and the phase shift has been derived via the MM algorithm to obtain its closed-form solution. We also analyzed the convergence property of the proposed BCD algorithm. Finally, simulation results have been presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme over the baseline schemes, which highlights the positive role of the IRS for the secrecy performance enhancement in the MIMO wireless communication systems.
