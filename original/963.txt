Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided wireless communications have drawn significant attention recently. We study the physical layer security of the downlink RIS-aided transmission framework for randomly located users in the presence of a multi-antenna eavesdropper. To show the advantages of RIS-aided networks, we consider two practical scenarios: Communication with and without RIS. In both cases, we apply the stochastic geometry theory to derive exact probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. Furthermore, the obtained PDF and CDF are exploited to evaluate important security performance of wireless communication including the secrecy outage probability, the probability of nonzero secrecy capacity, and the average secrecy rate. Monte-Carlo simulations are subsequently conducted to validate the accuracy of our analytical results. Compared with traditional MIMO systems, the RIS-aided system offers better performance in terms of physical layer security. In particular, the security performance is improved significantly by increasing the number of reflecting elements equipped in a RIS. However, adopting RIS equipped with a small number of reflecting elements cannot improve the system performance when the path loss of NLoS is small.

SECTION I.Introduction
Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been proposed as a promising technique as it can achieve high spectral-/energy-efficiency through adaptively controlling the wireless signal propagation environment [1]. Specifically, RIS is a planar array which comprises a large number of nearly passive reflecting elements. By equipping the RIS with a controller, each element of the RIS can independently introduce a phase shift on the reflected signal. Besides, a RIS can be easily coated on existing infrastructures such as walls of buildings, facilitating low-cost and low-complexity implementation. By smartly adjusting the phase shifts induced by all the reflecting elements, the RIS can bring various potential advantages to the system such as enriching the channel by deliberately introducing more multi-paths, increasing the coverage area, or beamforming, while consuming very low amount of energy due to the passive nature of its elements [2]. Recently, RIS has been introduced into many wireless communication systems. For instance, the authors in [3] studied a RIS-aided single-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) system and optimized the introduced phase shifts to maximize the total received signal power at the users. In [4], various designs were proposed for both the transmit power allocation at a base station (BS) and the phases introduced by the RIS elements to maximize the energy and the spectral efficiency of a RIS-aided multi-user MISO system. Besides, the authors of [5] considered a downlink (DL) multiuser communication system where the signal-to-interference-plus noise ratio (SINR) was maximized for given phase shifts introduced by a RIS.

In practice, communication security is always a fundamental problem in wireless networks due to its broadcast nature. Besides traditional encryption methods adopted in the application layer, physical layer security (PLS) [6]–[7][8] serves as an alternative for providing secure communication in fast access fifth-generation (5G) networks. Furthermore, PLS can achieve high-quality safety performance without requiring actual key distribution, which is a perfect match with the requirements of 5G. To fully exploit the advantages of 5G, multi-antenna technology has become a powerful tool for enhancing the PLS in wireless fading networks, e.g. [9]–[10][11][12][13][14][15]. In particular, with the degrees of freedom provided by multiple antennas, a transmitter can steer its beamforming direction to exploit the maximum directivity gain to reduce the potential of signal leakage to eavesdroppers. However, there are only a few works considering the PLS in the emerging RIS-based communication systems, despite its great importance for modern wireless systems. For example, a RIS-aided secure communication system was investigated in [16], [17] but their communication systems only consist of a transmitter, one legitimate receiver, single eavesdropper, and a RIS with limited practical applications. Furthermore, authors in [18] studied a DL MISO broadcast system where a BS transmits independent data streams to multiple legitimate receivers securely in the existence of multiple eavesdroppers. In order to conceive a practical RIS framework, user positions have to be taken into account using stochastic geometry for analyzing the system performance. Stochastic geometry is an efficient mathematical tool for capturing the topological randomness of networks [19], [20]. However, there are only a few works studying the impact of user-locations on the security performance.

Motivated by the aforementioned reasons, in this paper, we study the security performance of a RIS-aided DL multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system for randomly located roaming multi-antenna users in the presence of a multi-antenna eavesdropper. Moreover, we aim to answer a fundamental question “How much improvement can RIS bring to physical layer security in wireless communications?”. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

To show the advantages of exploiting RIS to enhance the PLS in wireless communications, we consider two practical scenarios: RIS is adopted and its absence. For each case, we derive the exact closed-form expressions of SINR and its PDF and CDF, respectively. Furthermore, considering a general set-up when the direct links between the BS and the RIS-aided users exist, we obtain the CDF and outage probability (OP) expressions.

Exploiting the tools from stochastic geometry, we propose a novel PLS analysis framework of RIS-aided communication systems. Novel expressions are derived to characterize the PLS performance, namely the secrecy outage probability (SOP), the probability of nonzero secrecy capacity (PNSC), and the average secrecy rate (ASR). The derived results can provide insights, i.e., the security performance is improved significantly by increasing the number of reflecting elements.

We derive highly accurate and simplified closed-form approximations of the CDF expressions of SINR for both scenarios. Furthermore, we present an asymptotic OP analysis in the high-SNR regime. The derived results show that adopting RIS equipped with a small number of reflecting elements cannot improve the system performance if the path loss of NLoS is small.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce the system model of the RIS-aided DL MIMO communication system and derive the exact closed-form of PDF and CDF expressions of SINR for users and the eavesdropper. Section III formulates the security performance analysis in two scenarios and present the corresponding exact expressions of the performance. In Section IV, we derive the approximations to the statistics of SINR in two scenarios, and analyze the OP in high-SINR regime. Section V presents the CDF and OP of scenario 2 when the direct links exist between BS and RIS-aided users. Section VI shows the simulation results and the accuracy of the obtained expressions is validated via Monte-Carlo simulations. Finally, Section VII concludes this paper.

SECTION II.System Model and Preliminaries
A. System Description
Let us consider the DL MIMO-RIS system and assume that a BS equipped with M transmit antennas (TAs) communicates with N users each of which is equipped with K receive antennas (RAs). a RIS is installed between the BS and the users for assisting end-to-end communication. By jointly optimizing the transmit precoding at the BS and the reflect phase shifts at the RIS according to the wireless channel conditions, the reflected signals can be added constructively at the desired receiver to enhance the received signal power, which can potentially yield a secure transmission [22]. In addition, a malicious eavesdropper who is equipped with K RAs aims to eavesdrop the information of the desired user. We assume that the number of reflecting elements on the RIS is L . The RIS is equipped with a controller to coordinate between the BS and the RIS for both channel acquisition and data transmission [3]. As such, the signal received from the BS can be manipulated by the RIS via adjusting the phase shifts and amplitude coefficients of the RIS elements.

On the other hand, various practical approaches have been proposed in the literature for the channel estimation of RIS-aided links [23]–[24][25]. Thus, we can assume that the global channel state information (CSI) of users is perfectly known for joint design of beamforming [26]. The CSI of the eavesdropper is typically unavailable as the eavesdropper is passive to hide its existence. Therefore, the passive eavesdropping scenario is considered [27]. To quantify the performance of such a RIS-aided communication system, we adopt SOP, PNSC, and ASR as performance metrics of interested.

Furthermore, we assume that the users are located on a disc with a radius r2 according to homogeneous Poisson point processes (HPPP) [28] with density λ and the eavesdropper chooses a position that is close to the legitimate user.

In practice, the direct transmission link between the BS and the users may be blocked by trees or buildings. Such assumption is applicable for 5G and mmWave communication systems that are known to suffer from high path and penetration losses resulting in signal blockages. In order to unveil the benefits in adopting the RIS, we consider the following two practice of communication scenarios:

As shown in Fig. 1 (a), for the first scenario, RIS is not adopted for enhancing the PLS and the quality of wireless communication. Specifically, both LoS and NLoS links exist in our system. Without loss of generality, we focus our attention on user n . We use dυ,σ to denote the distance between the BS and user n(n=1,…,N) . According to Table I, we have υ=un , σ=L for LoS links and υ=un , σ=NL for NLoS links.

For the second scenario, a RIS is deployed to leverage the LoS components with respect to both the BS and the users to assist their end-to-end communication of Fig. 1 (b). Thus, the NLoS users in scenario 1 now can communicate with BS through two LoS links with the help of RIS. Moreover, the locations of the BS and the RIS are fixed, hence we assume that the distance between the BS and the RIS is known and denoted by duR,L . In addition, the distance between the RIS and user n is denoted by duR−un,L .

B. Blockage Model
A blockage model was proposed in [29], which can be regarded as an accurate approximation of the statistical blockage model [30] and incorporates the LoS ball model proposed in [31] as a special case. In the considered system model, we adopt the blockage model to divide the users process in the spherical region around the BS into two independent HPPPs: LoS users process and NLoS users process. In particular, we define qL(r) as the probability that a link of length r is LoS. Each access link of separation r is assumed to be LoS with probability B1 if r≤r1 and 0 otherwise:
qL(r)={B1,0,ifr≤r1otherwise,(1)
View Sourcewhere 0≤B1≤1 . The parameter B1 can be interpreted as the average LoS area in a circular ball with a radius of r1 around the BS.

C. User Model
Let us assume that the users are located according to a HPPP within the disc shown as Fig. 1. The PDF of the user locations have been derived as [32, eq. (30)]. As a result, the CDF of the user locations is given by
FR(r)=r2(r22−r20)−r20(r22−r20),if r0<r<R,(2)
View Sourcewhere r0 is the minimum distance which is used to avoid encountering a singularity [33]. Thus, the probability of the distance between the user and the BS is less than r1 can be expressed as
B2≜Pr(r≤r1)=FR(r1)=r21(r22−r20)−r20(r22−r20).(3)
View Source

D. Path Loss Model
For the first communication scenario without a RIS, different path loss equations are applied to model the LoS and NLoS links as [29], [31]
L(d)={d−α1un,L,d−α2un,NL,ifBS→usernlinkisLoSlink.ifBS→usernlinkisNLoSlink,(4)
View Sourcewhere α1 and α2 are the LoS and NLoS path loss exponents, respectively. Typical values of α1 and α2 are defined in [34, Table 1], while α1<α2 hold in general.

For the second communication scenario with the assistance by the RIS, recently, the free-space path loss models of RIS-aided wireless communications are developed for different situations in [35, Proposition 1]. Authors in [35] proposed that the free-space path loss of RIS-aided communications is proportional to (duR,LduR−un,L)2 in the far field case. Thus, we obtain
L(duR,L,duR−un,L)=CL1CL2d−2uR,Ld−2uR−un,L,(5)
View Sourcewhere CL1 and CL2 denote the path loss intercepts of BS-RIS and RIS-user links, respectively.

E. Small-Scale Fading
To unify the system performance with different channel environment, generalized fading distributions have been proposed that include the most common fading distributions as special cases [8], [36], [37]. It has been shown recently that the Fisher-Snedecor F composite fading model can provide a more comprehensive modeling and characterization of the simultaneous occurrence of multipath fading and shadowing, which is generally more accurate than most other generalized fading models [38]. Furthermore, the Fisher-Snedecor F model is more general and includes several fading distributions as special cases, while being more mathematically tractable. For example, authors in [32] conceived a RIS-aided MIMO framework using Nakagami-m distribution. Note that Fisher-Snedecor F distribution includes the case of Nakagami-m distribution for ms→∞ as one of its subsequent special cases, such as Rayleigh (m=1) and one-sided Gaussian (m=1/2) . Motivated by this, the Fisher-Snedecor F distribution has been adopted to analyze the RIS-aided systems, i.e., RIS-aided Internet-of-Things networks [39].

To conceive a practical RIS framework, we assume that the small-scale fading of each link follows Fisher-Snedecor F fading distributions [39]. The channel correlation between RIS elements may exist because the electrical size of RIS’s reflecting elements is between λ/8 and λ/4 in principle, where λ is a wavelength of the signal [40]. However, it is hard to model the correlation in RIS because a tractable model for capturing such unique characteristics has not been reported in the literature yet. Therefore, we consider a scenario where the correlation is weak enough to be ignored, i.e., the electrical size of RIS’s reflecting elements is larger than λ/4 because the frequency of signals is high [41], [42]. Thus, we can assume that the small scale fading components are independent of each other.

For the first communication scenario, in order to characterize the LoS and NLoS links between the BS and users (eavesdropper), the small-scale fading matrices are defined as
Qυ,σ=⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢qυ,σ1,1⋮qυ,σK,1⋯⋮⋯qυ,σ1,M⋮qυ,σK,M⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥,(6)
View Sourcewhere Qυ,σ(σ=L,NL) is a K×M matrix. Letting υ=un , we obtain the small-scale fading matrix between the BS and user n . Using [43, Eq. (5)], the PDF of the elements of (6) can be expressed as
fX(x)=2mm((ms−1)Ω)msx2m−1B(m,ms)(mr2+(ms−1)Ω)m+ms,(7)
View Sourcewhere Ω=E[r2] is the mean power, m and ms are physical parameters which represent the fading severity and shadowing parameters, respectively.

For the second case, the small-scale fading matrices for the LoS links between the BS and users (eavesdropper) are same as the first case. In addition, in order to model the LoS links between the BS and the RIS, the small-scale fading matrix is defined as
QuR,L=⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢quR,L1,1⋮quR,LL,1⋯⋮⋯quR,L1,M⋮quR,LL,M⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥,(8)
View Sourcewhere QuR,L is a L×M matrix.

In order to model the LoS links between the RIS and users (eavesdropper), the small-scale fading matrices are defined as
Qυ,L=⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢qυ,L1,1⋮qυ,LK,1⋯⋮⋯qυ,L1,L⋮qυ,LK,L⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥,(9)
View Sourcewhere Qυ,L is a K×L matrix. Letting υ=uR−un , we get the small-scale fading matrix between the RIS and user n .

F. Directional Beamforming
Highly directional beamforming antenna arrays are deployed at the BS to compensate the significant path-loss in the considered system. For mathematical tractability and similar to [29], [30], the antenna pattern of users can be approximated by a sectored antenna model in [44] which is given by
Gυ,κ(θ)={Gυ,κ,gυ,κ,if|θ|≤θc,otherwise,(κ=1,…,K),(10)
View Sourcewhere θ , distributed in [0,2π] , is the angle between the BS and the user, θc denotes the beamwidth of the main lobe, for each TA, Gυ,κ and gυ,κ are respectively the array gains of main and sidelobes. In practice, the BS can adjust their antennas according to the CSI. In the following, we denote the boresight direction of the antennas as 0∘ . For simplifying the performance analysis, different antennas of the authorized users and the malicious eavesdropper are assumed to have same array gains. Thus, without loss of generality, we assume that Gυ,κ=Gυ , Gυ,κ=Gυ and gυ,κ=gυ .

G. SINR Analysis
Let us consider a composite channel model of large-scale and small-scale fading. It is assumed that the distance dυ,σ , υ=u1,…,uN,ue , and σ=L,NL are independent but not identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) and the large-scale fading is represented by the path loss. In the DL transmission, the complex baseband transmitted signal at the BS can be then expressed as

The transmit power consumed at the BS can be expressed as
P=∑n=1N∥pun∥2.(12)
View SourceFor the first communication scenario, e.g., Fig. 1 (a), there are both LoS and NLoS links. The signal received by user n or the eavesdropper from the BS can be expressed as
yυ,σ=GυL(dυ,σ)−−−−−−−−√vυQυ,σpυsυ+GυL(dυ,σ)−−−−−−−−√∑i≠υNvυQυ,σpisiMulti−userinterference+vυN0,(13)

For the second communication scenario, e.g., Fig. 1 (b), there are LoS and RIS-aided links. For LoS links, the signal received by the user or the eavesdropper can be obtained by letting σ=L in (13). For RIS-aided links, the signal can be expressed as
=yυRISGυL(duR,L,duR−υ,L)−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√vυQuR−υ,LΦQuR,Lpυsυ+vυN0+GυL(duR,L,duR−υ,L)−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√∑i≠υNvυQuR−υ,LΦQuR,LpisiMulti−userinterference,(14)

In the literature, numerous methods have been proposed to obtain the effective phase shift introduced by all the elements of the RIS, e.g., [3], [32], [46]–[47][48]. To mitigate the interference at the nth user and perform well both in RIS and non-RIS scenarios, we adopt the design of passive beamforming process and the downlink user-detection vectors proposed in [32]. The passive beamforming matrix at RIS can be obtained as [32, eq. (13)]
Φ=H~−1Xβmax,(15)
View Sourcewhere βmax is obtained by finding the maximum amplitude coefficient, X is the signal sent by BS, and H~ can be formulated from QuR−u1,LΦQuR,L , … , QuR−uN,LΦQuR,L as [32, eq. (9)].

The detection vector of the nth user can be written as [32, eq. (19)]
vun=Tunxun,(16)
View Sourcewhere Tun is derived by the left singular vectors of H~ . With the aid of the classic maximal ratio combining technique, xun can be expressed as
xun=THunhun∣∣THunhun∣∣,(17)
View Sourcewhere hun is the unth column of the effective channel matrix QuR−un,LΦQuR,L . Thus, the SINRs involved in both scenarios can be obtained.

For the first case, the received SINR at user n and the eavesdropper are denoted as SINRυ,σ , and it can be expressed as2
SINRυ,σ=Gυ∥∥hˆυ,σ∥∥2F(dυ,σ)−ασpunβ2maxQ2σ2N,(18)
View Sourcewhere pun denotes the transmit power of the BS for user, Q≜K−M−1 is the effective antenna gain, and

View Sourceis a Q×M matrix which denotes the channel gain of user n . In addition, we can see that the eavesdropper’s SINR is affected by the random directivity gain Gue(θ) .

For the second case, the SINR of LoS path can be obtained by letting σ=L in (18). For the RIS-aided path, with the help of the design of passive beamforming process [32], the SINR with the optimal phase shift design of RIS’s reflector array can be derived as [32, eq. (29)]

Remark 1:
By comparing Theorem 1 and Theorem 3 or Theorem 2 and Theorem 4, we can see that, caused by the characteristics of Fisher-Snedecor F distribution, the CDF and PDF of the SINR for the RIS-aided path are very similar to that of the LoS or NLoS path. This insight is very useful because we only need to further investigate Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 for performance analysis of the first communication scenario. In other words, we can get the results for the RIS-aided scenario through simple parameter transformation. Specifically, we can let mℓ→m1,ℓm2,ℓ , msℓ→ms1,ℓms2,ℓ , Γ(mℓ)→Γ(m1,ℓ)Γ(m2,ℓ) , Γ(msℓ)→Γ(ms1,ℓ)Γ(ms2,ℓ) , (mℓ)→(m1,ℓ);(m2,ℓ) , (msℓ)→(ms1,ℓ);(ms2,ℓ) , QM→QL and ασ=NL , where A→B means replacing A with B , and the results for the RIS-aided scenario will follow.

SECTION III.Security Performance Analysis
The secrecy rate over fading wiretap channels [51] is defined as the difference between the main channel rate and the wiretap channel rate as

View Sourcewhich means that a positive secrecy rate can be assured if and only if the received SINR at user n has a superior quality than that at the eavesdropper.

In the considered RIS-aided system, we assume that the location of users are random and define

Besides, we assume that the eavesdropper has the same path loss as user n because they are close to each other.

A. Outage Probability Characterization
The OP is defined as the probability that the instantaneous SINR is less than Zth , where Zth is the determined SNR threshold. In the first communication scenario, the OP can be directly calculated as
OP=PA[FZun,L(Zth),FZun,NL(Zth)]T,(34)
View Sourcewhich can be evaluated directly with the help of (22).

Remark 2:
In the second communication scenario, the OP can be obtained by replacing FZun,NL(Zth) in (34) with FZun,RIS(Zth) . We can observe that OP decreases when the channel condition of user n is improved. Moreover, a RIS equipped with more elements will also make the OP lower.

B. SOP Characterization
The secrecy outage probability (SOP), is defined as the probability that the instantaneous secrecy capacity falls below a target secrecy rate threshold. In the first communication scenario, the SOP can be written as
SOP==PB⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢Pr(Zun,L≤RsZue,L,G+Rs−1)Pr(Zun,L≤RsZue,L,g+Rs−1)Pr(Zun,NL≤RsZue,NL,G+Rs−1)Pr(Zun,NL≤RsZue,NL,g+Rs−1)⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥PB[SOP1,G,SOP1,g,SOP2,G,SOP2,G]T,(35)

Proposition 1:
Let SOPσ,λ≜Pr(Zun,σ≤RsZue,σ,λ+Rs−1) denotes the element of the matrix in (35), where λ=G,g . We can express SOPσ,λ as

Remark 3:
In the second communication scenario, the SOP of the RIS-aided path can be obtained with the help of Remark 1. From (36), we can see that the SOP will decrease when the fading parameter mun and msun increase because of better communication conditions. In addition, we can see that Q , M , and L will affect the dimension of the multivariate Fox’s H -function, so Q , M and L have a greater impact on the SOP than the channel parameters. Thus, it is obvious that communication system designers can increase L of RIS for lower SOP.

C. PNSC Characterization
Another fundamental performance metric of the PLS is the probability of non-zero secrecy capacity (PNSC) which can be defined as
PNSC==PB⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢Pr(Zun,L>Zue,L,G)Pr(Zun,L>Zue,L,g)Pr(Zun,NL>Zue,NL,G)Pr(Zun,NL>Zue,NL,g)⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥PB[PNZ1,G,PNZ1,g,PNZ2,G,PNZ2,G]T.(40)

Thus, we exploit (40) and Theorems 1–4 to arrive the following proportions.

Remark 4:
For the second communication scenario, the PNSC of the RIS-aided path can be easily obtained according to Remark 1. From (41), we can see that PNSC will increase when user n has good communication conditions or when the eavesdropper is in a bad communication environment. Besides, we can observe that PNSC is also more susceptible to Q , M , and L , because these parameters directly determine the dimension of the multivariate Fox’s H -function. In general, system designers can improve PNSC by increasing the size of the RIS.

D. ASR Characterization
The ASR describes the difference between the rate of the main channel and wiretap channel over instantaneous SINR can be expressed as\begin{align*} ASR=&{\mathbf{P_{B}}}\left [{ \begin{array}{l} E\left [{ {C_{s}\left ({{{Z_{u_{n},{\mathrm{ L}}}},{Z_{u_{e},{\mathrm{ L}},G}}} }\right)} }\right]\\ E\left [{ {C_{s}\left ({{{Z_{u_{n},{\mathrm{ L}}}},{Z_{u_{e},{\mathrm{ L}},g}}} }\right)} }\right]\\ E\left [{ {C_{s}\left ({{{Z_{u_{n},{\mathrm{ NL}}}},{Z_{u_{e},{\mathrm{ NL}},G}}} }\right)} }\right]\\ E\left [{ {C_{s}\left ({{{Z_{u_{n},{\mathrm{ NL}}}},{Z_{u_{e},{\mathrm{ NL}},g}}} }\right)} }\right] \end{array} }\right] \\=&{\mathbf{P_{B}}}{\left [{ {AS{C_{1,G}},AS{C_{1,g}},AS{C_{2,G}},AS{C_{2,G}}} }\right]^{\mathrm{ T}}}.\tag{45}\end{align*}
View SourceWe derive the following proposition using (45) and Theorems 1–4.

Remark 5:
For second communication scenario, the ASR of the RIS-aided path can also be obtained according to Remark 1. From (46), as expected, better channel conditions will result in a higher ASR. In addition, we can also observe that the ASR can be improved by assuring larger RIS because the multivariate Fox’s H -function in ASR is also more easily affected by Q , M , and L as SOP and PNSC.

SECTION IV.Asymptotic Analysis
In the SINR expression (18) of scenario 1, we observe that \left \|{ {{{\widehat {\mathbf{h}}}_{\upsilon,\sigma }}} }\right \|_{F}^{2} is the sum of Fisher-Snedecor \mathcal {F} RVs. An accurate closed-form approximation to the distribution of sum of Fisher-Snedecor \mathcal {F} RVs using single Fisher-Snedecor \mathcal {F} distribution has been given in [53, Theorem 3]. Thus, eq. (18) can be expressed as\begin{equation*} {\mathrm{SIN}}{{\mathrm{R}}_{\upsilon,\sigma '}} \approx {A_{1}}{\left ({{{d_{\upsilon,\sigma }}} }\right)^{ - {\alpha _\sigma }}}{\cal F_{1}},\tag{52}\end{equation*}
View Sourcewhere A_{1} is defined after (22), {\cal F_{1}} \sim {\mathcal{ F}}\left ({{{m_{\cal F_{1}}},{m_{s{\cal F_{1}}}},{\bar \gamma _{\cal F_{1}}}} }\right) is a single Fisher-Snedecor \mathcal {F} RV which is adopted to approximate \left \|{ {{{\widehat {\mathbf{h}}}_{\upsilon,\sigma }}} }\right \|_{F}^{2} , where {m_{\cal F_{1}}},{m_{s{\cal F_{1}}}} , and {\bar \gamma _{\cal F_{1}}} can be obtained from the parameters of \left \|{ {{{\widehat {\mathbf{h}}}_{\upsilon,\sigma }}} }\right \|_{F}^{2} with the help of [53, eq. (14)].

In the SINR expression (20) of scenario 2, {\left \|{ {{{\widehat {\mathbf{h}}}_{\upsilon,{\mathrm{RIS}}}}} }\right \|_{F}^{2}} is the sum of product of two Fisher-Snedecor \mathcal {F} RVs. With the help of [8, eq. (18)] and [8, eq. (10)], we can exploit a single Fisher-Snedecor \mathcal {F} RV to approximate the product of two Fisher-Snedecor \mathcal {F} RVs. Therefore, the distribution of {\left \|{ {{{\widehat {\mathbf{h}}}_{\upsilon,{\mathrm{RIS}}}}} }\right \|_{F}^{2}} can also be approximated by a single Fisher-Snedecor \mathcal {F} distribution. Following the similar parameters transformation method as in (52), eq. (20) can be approximated as \begin{equation*} {\mathrm{SIN}}{{\mathrm{R}}_{\upsilon,{\rm {RIS}'}}}\approx {A_{2}}{d_{\upsilon,{\mathrm{L}}}}^{ - 2}{\cal F_{2}},\tag{53}\end{equation*}
View Sourcewhere {\cal F_{2}} \sim {\mathcal{ F}}\left ({{{m_{\cal F_{2}}},{m_{s{\cal F_{2}}}},{\bar \gamma _{\cal F_{2}}}} }\right) is a single Fisher-Snedecor \mathcal {F} RV, and A_{2} is defined after (27).

Theorem 5:
For the first communication scenario, let Z_{\upsilon,\sigma '}={\mathrm{SIN}}{{\mathrm{R}}_{\upsilon,\sigma '}} , the CDF of Z_{\upsilon,\sigma '} can be expressed as \begin{equation*} {F_{{Z_{\upsilon,\sigma '}}}}\left ({z }\right)= \frac {{2{\bar \gamma _{\cal F_{1}}}^{{m_{\cal F_{1}}}^{2} - {m_{\cal F_{1}}}}\left ({{{G_{1,0}} - {G_{1,2}}} }\right)}}{{\alpha _\sigma \left ({{r_{2}^{2} - r_{0}^{2}} }\right)\Gamma \left ({{{m_{\cal F_{1}}}} }\right)\Gamma \left ({{{m_{s{\cal F_{1}}}}} }\right)}},\tag{54}\end{equation*}
View Sourcewhere G_{1,\hbar }\,\,(\hbar =0,2) is derived as \begin{align*} G_{1,\hbar }=r_\hbar ^{2}G_{2,0}^{3,0}\left ({{\left.{ {\frac {A_{1}{\left ({{{m_{s{\cal F_{1}}}} - 1} }\right)}}{{r_\hbar ^{\alpha _\sigma }{m_{\cal F_{1}}}z{\bar \gamma _{\cal F_{1}}}^{ - {m_{\cal F_{1}}}}}}} }\right |\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccccccc} {1,1 + \frac {{\mathrm{2}}}{\alpha _\sigma }}\\ {0,{m_{s{\cal F_{1}}}},\frac {{\mathrm{2}}}{\alpha _\sigma }} \end{array}} }\right).\tag{55}\end{align*}
View Source

Proof:
Please refer to Appendix F.

Remark 6:
For the second communication scenario, let Z_{\upsilon,{\mathrm{RIS}} '}={\mathrm{SIN}}{{\mathrm{R}}_{\upsilon,{\mathrm{RIS}}'}} , the CDF of Z_{\upsilon,{\mathrm{RIS}}'} can be obtained through simple parameter transformation in (54). Specifically, we can let A_{1}\to A_{2} , {\alpha _\sigma }\to 2 , {m_{\cal F_{1}}}\to {m_{\cal F_{2}}} , {m_{s{\cal F_{1}}}}\to {m_{s{\cal F_{2}}}} , {\bar \gamma _{\cal F_{1}}}\to {\bar \gamma _{\cal F_{2}}} , G_{1,0}\to G_{2,0} , and G_{1,2}\to G_{2,2} .

Thus, with the help of the approximated CDF of {\mathrm{SIN}}{{\mathrm{R}}_{\upsilon,\sigma '}} and {\mathrm{SIN}}{{\mathrm{R}}_{\upsilon,{\mathrm{RIS}}'}} , we can re-derive the performance metrics, i.e., OP, SOP, PNSC, and ASR, to simplify the involved calculations. Note that the multivariate Fox’s H -functions in the CDF expressions of {\mathrm{SIN}}{{\mathrm{R}}_{\upsilon,\sigma }} and {\mathrm{SIN}}{{\mathrm{R}}_{\upsilon,{\mathrm{RIS}}}} can be expressed in the form of a multi-fold Mellin-Barnes type contour integration where the order of integration increases with the number of elements in the RIS. Besides, the Meijer G -functions in the CDF expressions of {\mathrm{SIN}}{{\mathrm{R}}_{\upsilon,\sigma }} and {\mathrm{SIN}}{{\mathrm{R}}_{\upsilon,{\mathrm{RIS}}}} can be written as a one-fold Mellin-Barnes integration. Therefore, the re-derivations of OP, SOP, PNSC, and ASR follow similar methods as Section III A-D, but the results are simpler. In the following, we focus on OP and study the asymptotic behavior in the high-SINR regime, i.e., when \gamma _{\cal F_{1}}\to \infty , to gain more insights.

For the first communication scenario, the OP can be expressed as \begin{equation*} OP={\mathbf{P_{A}}} {\left [{ {{F_{{Z_{u_{n},{\mathrm{ L}}}}}}(Z_{\mathrm{ th}}),{F_{{Z_{u_{n},{\mathrm{ NL}}}}}}(Z_{\mathrm{ th}})} }\right]^{\mathrm{ T}}},\tag{56}\end{equation*}
View Sourcewhich can be evaluated with the aid of the CDF of Z_{\upsilon,\sigma '} . To obtain more engineering insights from (56), the asymptotic behavior in the high-SINR regime is analyzed.

Proposition 4:
In the high-SINR regime, the OP can be approximated as \begin{equation*} OP={\mathbf{P_{A}}} {\left [{ {{F_{{Z_{u_{n},{\mathrm{ L}}'}}}}(Z_{\mathrm{ th}}),{F_{{Z_{u_{n},{\mathrm{ NL}}'}}}}(Z_{\mathrm{ th}})} }\right]^{\mathrm{ T}}},\tag{57}\end{equation*}
View Sourcewhere\begin{align*} {F_{{Z_{u_{n}\!,\!{\sigma }'}}}}\!=\!\!\frac {{2{\bar \gamma _{{\mathcal {F}_{1}}}}^{ -\! {m_{{\mathcal {F}_{1}}}}}\!\!\left ({\! {r_{2}^{2 \!+ \!{\alpha _\sigma } \!{m_{{\mathcal {F}_{1}}}}}\! \!-\! \! r_{0}^{2\! +\! {\alpha _\sigma }\!{m_{{\mathcal {F}_{1}}}}}} \!}\right)\!{m_{{\mathcal {F}_{1}}}} \! \!^{{m_{{\mathcal {F}_{1}}}}\! -\! 1}\!A_{1}^{m_{{\mathcal {F}_{1}}}}\!{Z_{\mathrm{ th}}^{{m_{{\mathcal {F}_{1}}}}}}}}{{\left ({{2 \!+\! {\alpha _\sigma }{m_{{\mathcal {F}_{1}}}}} \!}\right)\left ({\! {r_{2}^{2} \!- \! r_{0}^{2}} }\right)\!B\!\left ({\!{{m_{s{\mathcal {F}_{1}}}},{m_{{\mathcal {F}_{1}}}}} \!}\right){{\left ({{{m_{s{\mathcal {F}_{1}}}} \!- \!1} }\right)}^{{m_{{\mathcal {F}_{1}}}}}}}}, \\{}\tag{58}\end{align*}
View Sourceand {\sigma }'={\mathrm{ L}}, {\mathrm{ NL}} .

Please refer to Appendix G.

Furthermore, at high-SINRs, the OP can be written as OP \propto {\bar \gamma _{{\mathcal {F}_{1}}}}^{ - {G_{d}}} , where {G_{d}} denotes the diversity order. From (57), we can observe that {G_{d}}=m_{\mathcal F_{1}} .

As for the second communication scenario, the OP and corresponding asymptotic expression can be obtained through parameter transformation in Remark 6.

SECTION V.RIS-Aided System With Direct Links
For the second communication scenario, we assume that there is no direct links between the BS and the users when the BS beams toward the RIS. This assumption is reasonable when the signals have high frequency which are easily blocked by obstructions [54].

However, as shown in Fig. 2, a more general SINR expression with direct channels considered can be given as \begin{equation*} {\mathrm{SIN}}{{\mathrm{R}}_{\upsilon,{\mathrm{RD}}}} = {A_{2}}d_{\upsilon,{\mathrm{L}}}^{ - 2}\left ({{\left \|{ {{{\widehat {\mathbf{h}}}_{\upsilon,\sigma }}} }\right \|_{F}^{2} + \left \|{ {{{\widehat {\mathbf{h}}}_{\upsilon,{\mathrm{RIS}}}}} }\right \|_{F}^{2}} }\right).\tag{59}\end{equation*}
View SourceNote that deriving the exact statistical characteristics of {\mathrm{SIN}}{{\mathrm{R}}_{\upsilon,{\mathrm{RD}}}} are challenging, if not impossible, for calculating the performance metrics. Thus, with the help of (52) and (53), we can obtain the high-quality approximated CDF of {\mathrm{SIN}}{{\mathrm{R}}_{\upsilon,{\mathrm{RD}}}} .

Therefore, the OP of the second scenario with direct links can be expressed as OP={\mathbf{P_{A}}} {\left [{ {{F_{{Z_{\upsilon,L}}}}(Z_{\mathrm{ th}}),{F_{{Z_{\upsilon,RD}}}}(Z_{\mathrm{ th}})} }\right]^{\mathrm{ T}}} .

SECTION VI.Numerical Results
In this section, analytical results are presented to illustrate the advantages of applying the RIS to enhance the security of the DL MIMO communication system. We assume that the noise variances \sigma _{N} at user n and the eavesdropper are identical and \sigma _{N}=0\,\,{\mathrm{ dB}} . The transmit power {p_{u_{n}}} is defined in dB with respect to the noise variance. The array gains of main and sidelobes are set to {G_{\upsilon} }=30\,\,{\mathrm{ dB}} and {g_{\upsilon} }=-10\,\,{\mathrm{ dB}} . For the small scale fading, we set m_{u_{n}}=5 , m_{u_{e}}=3 , m_{s_{u_{n}}}=5 , m_{s_{u_{e}}}=3 , {{\bar {\gamma }}_{u_{n}}}={{\bar {\gamma }}_{u_{e}}}=-10\,\,{\mathrm{ dB}} . The path loss exponent is set to \alpha _{1}=2 . Moreover, in the considered simulation scenario, we assume that r_{2} = 400 , r_{1}=300 , r_{0}=1 , \beta _{\mathrm{ max}}=1 , d_{u_{R},{\mathrm{ L}}}=30 and B_{1}=0.3 . The numerical results are verified via Monte-Carlo simulations by averaging the obtain performance over 106 realizations.

Figure 3 depicts the OP performance versus transmit power {p_{u_{n}}} with K=4 , M=2 , Z_{\mathrm{ th}}=0\,\,{\mathrm{ dB}} . As it can be observed, the OP decreases as transmit power and L increase, which means that the introduction of a RIS can provide a higher quality of communication for the considered MIMO wireless communication system. Moreover, when \alpha _{2}=2.5 , we can observe that RIS cannot improve the system performance when the number of reflecting elements is small. This is because the OP is dominated by the path loss. When the signal is propagates to the user via the direct links, the signal propagation distance is shorter. Furthermore, while considering the direct links exists between BS and RIS-aided users, we can observe the OP is slightly lower than while assuming no direct links exist. In addition, analytical results perfectly match the approximate ones and Monte-Carlo simulations well. In addition, the asymptotic expressions match well the exact ones at high-SINR values thus proving their validity and versatility.

Figure 4 illustrates the OP performance versus the number of reflecting elements equipped in RIS, with K=4 , M=2 , Z_{\mathrm{ th}}=0\,\,{\mathrm{ dB}} , and p_{ {\mu {\mathrm{ m}}}}=25\,\,{\mathrm{ dB}} . In Fig. 4, we can observe that the OP decreases as L increases. This is because the increases of RIS’s elements offer more degrees of freedom for efficient beamforming and interference management which can significantly improve the system performance. However, when the path loss of NLoS is small, applying a RIS equipped with a small number of elements, i.e., less than 25, cannot offer a lower OP than the traditional MIMO system. This is because the signal propagation distance in the direct link between the BS and user is shorter then the end-to-end link when RIS is used. In contrast, we can observe that when the path loss of NLoS is large, i.e., when \alpha _{2}=3 , the performance gain brought by RIS is significant. Furthermore, when L is sufficiently large such that the reflected signal power by the RIS dominates the total received power at user n , we can observe that there is a diminishing return in the slope of OP due to channel hardening [56]. Thus, to achieve a low OP at the user, there exists an trade-off between the number of reflecting elements in RIS and the transmit power of the BS. Furthermore, we can find that an outage floor exists in OP when L \to \infty . This is because the SINR first increases with L , which results in a decreasing OP. As L continues increasing, the power of noise becomes negligible compared to the power of received signal. Hence, the SINR becomes saturated which is independent of L , leading to a saturated OP.

Figure 5 depicts the SOP performance versus transmit power {p_{u_{n}}} under different \theta _{c} with R_{t}=1 , K=4 , M=2 , and \alpha _{2}=3 . For a certain setting of the parameters, the SOP decreases as the transmit power of the BS increases. Besides, it can be easily observed that the SOP increases as \theta _{c} decreases. This is because a large value of \theta _{c} offers the eavesdroppers a higher possibility in exploiting the larger array gains. Again, it is evident that the analytical results match the Monte-Carlo simulations well.

Figure 6 shows the analytical and simulated PNSC versus transmit power {p_{u_{n}}} under different \theta _{c} with R_{t}=1 , K=4 , M=2 , and \alpha _{2}=3 . As it can be observed, the PNSC decreases as \theta _{c} increases because the eavesdropper is more likely to receive signals. Moreover, similar to the results in Fig. 5, the use of RIS can enhance the security of the system. Furthermore, if the transmit signal power is not high or the number of reflecting elements on the RIS is not large, the performance gain brought by RIS is rather then limited, as the signal propagation distance in the direct link between the BS and user is shorter then the end-to-end link when the RIS is used. However, with the increase of transmit power, the communication scenario with RIS enjoys a better security performance.

Figure 7 illustrates the ASR as a function of the transmit power {p_{u_{n}}} for different settings of L with K=4 , M=2 , and \alpha _{2}=3 . As expected, there is a perfect match between our analytical and simulated results. Like SOP and PNSC, when the transmit power is not large, there is only a small difference for the ASR between communication with RIS and without RIS. This is also because adopting RIS increases the signal propagation distance. In contrast, when the power is moderate to high, RIS is very useful for enhancing the security of the physical layer, and as analyzed in Remark 5, the larger the L is, the more obvious the performance gain is. Furthermore, we can observe that there is a diminishing return in the ASR gain due to increasing L . This is because when L is large, the security performance of the system is mainly limited by other factors, such as the channel quality and the path loss.

SECTION VII.Conclusion
We proposed a new RIS-aided secure communication system and presented the exact of expressions for CDF and PDF of the SINR for both cases of the RIS is used or not used. Our analytical framework showed the analytical performance expressions of RIS-aided communication subsume the counterpart case without exploiting RIS which can be obtained by some simple parameter transformation of the former case. Secrecy metrics, including the SOP, PNSC, and ASR, were all derived with closed-form expressions in terms of the multivariate Fox’s H -function. Numerical results confirmed that RIS can bring significant performance gains and enhance the PLS of the considered system, especially when the number of reflecting elements is sufficiently large and the path loss of NLoS links is severe.
