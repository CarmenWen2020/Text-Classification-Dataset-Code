Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have found compelling applications in intelligent logistics, search and rescue as well as in air-borne Base Station (BS). However, their communications are prone to both channel errors and eavesdropping. Hence, we investigate the max-min secrecy fairness of UAV-aided cellular networks, in which Cooperative Rate-Splitting (CRS) aided downlink transmissions are employed by each multi-antenna UAV Base Station (UAV-BS) to safeguard the downlink of a two-user Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO) system against an external multi-antenna Eavesdropper ( $Eve$ ). Realistically, only Imperfect Channel State Information (ICSI) is assumed to be available at the transmitter. Additionally, we consider a realistic total power constraint and guarantee the specific Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the legitimate users. To handle the worst-case channel uncertainty of the legitimate users and an external $Eve$ , we conceive a robust secure resource allocation algorithm, which maximizes the minimum worst-case secrecy rate of the legitimate users. Based on the CRS principle, the transmitter splits and encodes the messages of legitimate users into common as well as private streams and the user having stronger CSI is asked to help the cell-edge user by opportunistically forwarding its decoded common message. In contrast to the existing schemes adopted in the literature for ensuring secure transmission of the first cooperative phase only, in our proposed solution the common message has a twin-fold mission. Explicitly, apart from serving as the desired message, it also acts as Artificial Noise (AN) for drowning out $Eve$ without consuming extra power. This is in stark contrast to the conventional AN designs. In the second phase, the pure AN is directed towards the $Eve$ , deploying a robust Maximum Ratio Transmitter (MRT) beamformer at the UAV-BS. To solve the resultant non-convex optimization problem we resort to the Sequential Parametric Convex Approximation (SPCA) method together with a bespoke initialization algorithm to avoid any failure due to infeasibility. Our simulation results confirm that the proposed secure transmission scheme outperforms the existing cooperative benchmarkers
SECTION I.Introduction
Physical layer security (PLS), whose core idea is to opportunistically exploit the random characteristics of fading channels, has attracted growing attention in the recent decade as a promising technique of enhancing the secrecy of wireless communications [1]–[2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. A pair of proposed PLS solutions, namely beamforming and jamming techniques have been particularly extensively exploited [3], [4], [6]–[7][8][9]. However, the performance of these PLS schemes critically relies on the availability of near-perfect Channel State Information at the Tx (CSIT), particularly in multi-user systems1 [10], [11].

Recently, thanks to the high mobility, on-demand coverage, and providing Line-of-Sight (LoS) link, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks have attracted a great deal of interest because of their capability of supporting the Key Performance Indicators (KPI)s of next-generation networks [12], [15], [16]. In this regard, UAVs may be deployed as mobile base stations (UAV-BS) to assist the BS on the ground in its service provision. Actually, with the aim of traffic offloading [17], the burden imposed on the over-sailing macro-cell can be directed to the small UAV-cells to mitigate the burden imposed on the cellular network [12], [18]. Furthermore, UAV-BSs can assist Heterogeneous Networks (HetNet), where the problem of inter-user interference management would be problematic [12], [19]. Explicitly, to alleviate the inter-user interference within each small UAV-cell, the 3D-position of UAVs can be exploited for increasing the degrees of freedom (DoF) [20]. For achieving a high directional gain, hence minimizing the interference between the users in [21], a null-steered beamforming technique has been employed by the UAV-BSs. From a secrecy perspective, the PLS designs can also exploit the UAVs for detecting the Eves ’ location via the UAV-mounted camera or radar [22], as well as the new DoF provided by the trajectory design [23]–[24][25], and the LoS jamming link provided by the UAV-based friendly jammer [26].

Meanwhile, to satisfy the heterogeneous and massive connectivity requirements of NextG-Com, deploying Multiple Access (MA) techniques in the downlink Multi Input-Single Output Broadcast (MISO-BC) systems has been highlighted [6], [11], [12], [24], [27]–[28][29][30]. To be more specific, recently, Rate Splitting (RS) Multiple Access (RSMA), which is a generalized joint framework of Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) and Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA), was introduced as a promising transmission scheme, capable of outperforming both NOMA and SDMA in terms of its multiplexing gain and spectral efficiency [27]. Using RS, each transmitted message is split into a common and a private part, followed by linear transmit precoding at the multi-antenna Tx and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) at each receiver [27]. As a further development, Cooperative Rate Splitting (CRS) has been studied in [28] that outperforms its Non-cooperative Rate Splitting (NRS) counterpart [29] in terms of both its reliability [27] and security [30]. To be specific, using CRS, the RS-near user having higher power with stronger CSI is asked to opportunistically forward its decoded common message to the other user. Upon considering the half-duplex constraint, data transmission takes place in two consecutive time-slots. Hence, CRS benefits from the cooperation of the legitimate users. It is worth of mentioning that as a special form of RSMA, secure NOMA systems have been proposed in [31] and [32], which use AN and beamforming for secrecy purposes. However, the non-orthogonal superimposed streams, sent by the transmitter, are taken into account as “useless” in sense of secrecy, as they can be completely removed via SIC at Eve . More explicitly, the Eve is able to decode some superimposed streams and wiretap the remainder streams with less interference. In contrast, upon using RSMA approach, the common message constitutes the desired message as well as the artificial noise (AN) harnessed for confusing the potential Eve without the need for allocating extra transmit power to the AN [29], [30]. Thus, the solutions proposed by [31] and [32] are not applicable to the RSMA-based counterpart owing to the different natures of the problems.

The recent CRS-enabled systems of [28] and [30] have investigated the idealized simplifying assumption of having perfect CSI knowledge, but in case of UAV-communications due to instability of the platform in atmospheric turbulence, as well as its limited computation power, the CSI cannot be perfectly estimated at the UAV-BS [12], [26]. This will further exacerbate the detrimental impact of inter-user interference upon increasing the transmit power, specifically in UAV-MA networks, in which the UAV-BS is enabled by one of the MA techniques [11], [12]. Although the efficiency of RSMA has also been reported under imperfect CSIT in [11], [29], and [33], little attention has been given to the integration of RSMA with UAV-BS. Explicitly, the robust and secure design of CRS-aided UAV networks, under imperfect CSIT of the whole links,2 has not been studied as yet. A list of abbreviations and acronyms used throughout the paper is given in Table I. To gain more insight, the novelty of the proposed approach is boldly and explicitly contrasted to the state-of-the-art in Table II at a glance.

To elaborate our work little further, we consider a UAV-aided cellular network including an over-sailing macro BS and several UAV-aided cells as well as macro-cell users. For each UAV-cell, we consider the worst-case secrecy scenario for a MISO-BC system. In particular, a multi-antenna UAV-BS aims to communicate with two legitimate users in the presence of a multi-antenna Eve , that is able to maximize its wiretapping rate by doing Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) protocol [7]. Against this background, the contributions of our work are summarized as follows:

To safeguard confidentiality in the presence of multi antenna Eve , we propose a comprehensive CRS-based secrecy design, which guarantees both secrecy fairness between the two users and robustness against imperfect CSIT. To satisfy our secrecy fairness goal, given the power budget constraints imposed on our multi-carrier UAV-assisted system, we formulate the associated Worst-Case Secrecy Rate (WCSR) maximization problem optimized under the practical outage constraints of both cooperative phases.

Using the two-stage CRS strategy, we conceive a secrecy policy under which the first phase is secured by designing the RS-common-precoder, so that while Eve fails to attain a certain minimum eavesdropping rate, the common message can be decoded at legitimate users. By doing so, the common message twin-fold mission of both the information bearing intended message and the AN. Interestingly, by decoding and forwarding the common stream, two opportunities are provided to take full advantages of the common stream, hence further enhancing the secrecy. The second phase is also secured by focusing the AN towards the Eve by employing a robust Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT) beamformer at the idle UAV-BS. Given the limited power assigned to the second phase, we also optimize the relaying and jamming power, hence further increasing the secrecy rate. To further enhance the achievable secrecy fairness, we have optimized a pair of parameters as well, i.e., weighting factor determining the specific share of each user in the secrecy enhancement as well as time-slot-sharing parameter between two phases. We have also included an interference management constraint to protect the communications of over-sailing macro-cell against small UAV-cell transmissions.

To solve the resultant non-convex optimization problem, we resort to the Sequential Parametric Convex Approximation (SPCA) methodology of [34], leading to a trade-off between approaching optimality and the computational complexity.3 Moreover, to avoid any failure due to a potential infeasibility, a beneficial initialization algorithm is proposed for finding a feasible initial point of the original problem.

Our simulation results have shown that the proposed strategy outperforms both the Cooperative NOMA (C-NOMA) and the Cooperative SDMA (C-SDMA) strategies. We will also show that although the proposed CRS-based strategy has evolved from the NRS scheme of [29] for some propagation environments, it outperforms NRS on average. More precisely, we have shown that reliance on the cooperative phase is inevitable.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The system model and preliminaries are provided in Section II. Section III and IV describe the signal representation and the corresponding achievable information rate, respectively. Section V formulates our robust WCSR maximization problem. The proposed SPCA-based solution converts the non-convex problem into a convex problem and the associated feasible initialization procedures are provided in Section VI. In Section VII, our simulation results are presented and the paper is concluded in Section VIII. Finally, the Appendices and Proofs of the lemmas are provided in Section IX.

SECTION II.System Model and Preliminaries
In this section, the RS signal model, the channel models and their corresponding realistic impaired counterparts are firstly reviewed, which then serve as the basis of developing a robust and secure approach in an RS-based UAV-assisted cellular network. In this regard, a network including an over-sailing macro BS and I UAV cells as well as NM macro users are considered, as shown in Fig. 1. Although the macro users have higher priority in using the spectrum, the UAVs have been allowed by the BS to operate within the service range of the macro users. For the i -th UAV cell, a UAV hovering at a fixed altitude Hi provides communication services for Ni number of UAV users. The total bandwidth of BW is shared among all UAV users. The same spectrum is exploited by the macro-cell users and all the UAV cells, so the nodes outside the i -th UAV cell may interfere with the UAV nodes therein, inflicting Intra Macro-Cell Interference (IMCI). For each UAV cell, BW is partitioned into K sub-channels SCk|Kk=1 , each of which has a bandwidth of Bsc=BWK . If we let Nk|Kk=1 stand for the number of users assigned to SCk , a maximum number of Ni=∑Kk=1Nk users can be served by UAVi . However, without loss of generality we assume Nk=2 in the rest of this paper.

A. Transmitted RS Signal Model
We consider the i -th UAV cell4 of Fig. 1, where UAVi aims to communicate with two legitimate users, namely Ui1,k and Ui2,k through SCk , while Eve keeps on wiretapping silently. UAVi and Eve are multi-antenna devices respectively have Nt Transmit Antennas (TAs) and Ne Receive Antenna (RAs), while Ui1,k and Ui2,k are equipped with a single RA.

To concurrently serve two users through SCk , UAVi relies on the RS technique as shown if Fig. 2, which partitions the confidential messages destined for each legitimate user Win,k∣∣2n=1 into the common part Wi,cn,k , and private part Wi,pn,k . The resultant common parts Wi,cn,k∣∣2n=1 are incorporated into the Wi,ck , and encode to the common stream si,ck . By contrast, Wi,p1,k and Wi,p2,k are independently encoded into two different private streams si,p1,k , si,p2,k , respectively. Upon grouping the three streams into the vector sik≜[si,ck,si,p1,k,si,p2,k]T , the transmitted RS signal is given by:
xik=Piksik=pi,cksi,ck+∑n=1Nkpi,pn,ksi,pn,k,(1)
View Sourcewhere Pik=[pi,ck,pi,p1,k,pi,p2,k]∈CNt×3 is the beamforming matrix adopted by UAVi , which includes the linear precoding vector pi,ck , corresponding to the common stream as well as the precoding vectors pi,p1,k , pi,p2,k of the private streams. As for the power constraints, on one hand the RS signal’s transmit power pik≜Tr(xikxikH) , has to satisfy the power constraint budget of SCk , i.e. P¯ik . On the other hand, the power budget assigned to different SCk has to meet the power limit P¯iUAV at UAVi . Assuming that E{siksikH}=I3 , these constraints can be expressed as:
0≤Tr(PikPikH)≤P¯ik,∀k=1,…,K∑k=1KP¯ik≤P¯iUAV.(2)

At the receiver side, each user first reconstructs its corresponding message by decoding si,ck to retrieve the associated common message Wi,cn,k , followed by decoding the associated private streams by employing a different codebook from the one used at the transmitter [11].

We assume furthermore that, the received power of the cell-center user Ui1,k is higher than that of the cell-edge user Ui2,k . So, to further assist the transmission of Ui2,k , the cell-center user Ui1,k acts as a Decode-and-Forward (DF) relaying user who re-encodes si,ck and forwards it to Ui2,k . Given that all nodes obey the half-duplex constraint, data transmission takes place in two consecutive time-slots. Consequently, a dynamic time sharing parameter 0≤θ≤1 is introduced, where the portion θ of each time slot is allocated for the first phase of transmissions, while the relaying phase is allocated to the remaining (1−θ) portion. Thus, two opportunities are provided for Eve to wiretap the information during these two phases of transmissions. To safeguard the first phase, the corresponding beamformer pi,ck of the common stream is designed so that si,ck is simultaneously exploited as jamming noise at Eve , as detailed later in the paper. By contrast, in order to secure the transmission against Eve during the relaying phase, UAVi serves as a jammer. It should be emphasized that, we here assume the worst-case scenario in the sense of security, where the powerful, and high-complexity receiver of Eve knows its exact CSI and can use Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) and wiretap for gleaning confidential information at its full capacity.

B. Channel Definitions
The complex-valued channel coefficients between the UAV and the terrestrial nodes UAVi→Ui1,k , UAVi→Ui2,k,UAVi→Eve at the first phase are denoted by hin,k∈CNt×1 , n∈{1,2} and Hie,k∈CNe×Nt , respectively. These channels are modeled as hin,k=PLin.knin,k , ∀n∈{1,2,e} , with hie,k≜Vec(Hie,k)∈CNtNe×1 , and PLin.k≜d−αin,kn,i represents the path loss between UAVi and node n∈{1,2,e} , which is characterized by the distance between UAVi and a ground user. Furthermore, nin,k is i.i.d. Gaussian random variable; namely, nin,k[i]∼CN(0,1) represents the corresponding small scale fading. The path loss exponent αin,k obeys the probabilistic model of [40], which is appropriate for low-altitude UAVs including the LOS link that may be blocked by various environmental obstacles, given by:
αin,k≜Lin,k−Nin,k1+λ1eλ2(ϕin−λ1)+Nin,k.(3)
View Source

In fact, αin,k is composed of the LoS and non-LoS components Lin,k and Nin,k , respectively. Furthermore, ϕin≜180πsin−1(Hidin) , denotes the elevation angle between UAVi and the n -th user at a UAV to ground distance d , while λ1 and λ2 are determined by the wireless environment, for example urban, dense urban, etc., [40].

Additionally, fie,k∈CNe×1 and fi2,k∼∈C1×1 respectively denote the corresponding channel coefficients of Ui1,k→Eve and Ui1,k→Ui2,k links during the second phase. Furthermore, the transmissions of all nodes, relying on SCk and within the i -th UAV cell, are contaminated during both phases by the IMCI signal vik∈CNM×1 (with NM representing the number of macro users, occupying the same SCk ) and the corresponding channels are denoted by cin,k∈CNM×1 for n∈{1,2} and Cie,k∈CNM×Ne .

Remark 1 (Channel Imperfection):
In a realistic system, due to the transmission and processing delays, as well as the mobility of the users, the CSI may become outdated, hence resulting in inaccurate CSI that must be taken into account in a practical design. However, the path loss changes slowly, hence we assume that it can be perfectly compensated by power control. Thus, in this paper it is assumed that the CSI uncertainty is only affected by the small scale fading component nin,k . To be specific, because of the UAV’s platform fluctuations due to atmospheric turbulence, as well as owing to the limited computational power of the UAVs as compared to the BSs on the ground, the CSI error is assumed to contaminate the UAV cell’s links.

Based on Remark 1 together with the worst-case CSI error model of [29] and [41], the relationship between the estimated small scale fading coefficients, i.e. n^in,k , f^ie,k , f^i2,k and their corresponding exact counterparts, i.e. nin,k , fie,k , fi2,k , ∀n ∈{1,2,e} becomes:
nin,k≜fi2,k≜Θhn=Θf2=Θfe=n^in,k+△nin,k,f^i2,k+△fi2,k,fie,k≜f^ie,k+△fie,k,{△nin,k∈CNt×1:∥∥△nin,k∥∥2≤D(nin,k)ζ2}{△fi2,k:∣∣△fi2,k∣∣2≤ζ2},{△fie,k:∣∣△fie,k∣∣2≤D(fie,k)ζ2},(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)
View Sourcewhere △nin,k , △fie,k , and △fi2,k respectively stand for the CSI error corresponding to nin,k , fie,k , and fi2,k . As seen in (6), ζ specifies the radius of the uncertainty regions of △fi2,k , whilst for the vector of △nin,k and △fie,k , the error are region bounded by the radius of D(nin,k)−−−−−−−√ζ and D(fie,k)−−−−−−√ζ , respectively.

SECTION III.Signal Representation
In this section, we firstly drive the channel capacities, which are then used in the next sub-section to calculate the Effective Secrecy Throughput (EST), which is a well-suited performance metric in the face of channel uncertainties. Before proceeding, Fig. 3 shows the flow of the analysis described in the sequel. In terms of the worst-case secrecy scenario, Eve is assumed to be able to perfectly estimate its corresponding CSI. As for the legitimate UAV-Tx, only imperfect CSIT of the links is available at the Tx. Given this perspective, while Eve can achieve the actual channel capacity, Tx is only capable of achieving the estimated information rate. Thus we first derive the actual channel capacities and then obtain the estimated information rates, as shown in Fig. 3, as well.

A. Actual Channel Capacity
As discussed earlier, during the first time slot, UAVi transmits the RS signal xik . Accordingly, using the actual channel parameters, the signal received at Ui1,k , Ui2,k , and Eve in the first phase, respectively, which are denoted by yi1,k(1) , yi2,k(1) , and yie,k(1) are obtained as follows:
yin,k(1)=yie,k(1)=hin,kHxik+pM,k−−−−√cin,kHvik+zin,k(1),∀n ∈{1,2}w(1)e,kH(Hie,kxik+pM,k−−−−√Cie,kHvik+zie,k(1)),(9)
View Sourcewhere w(1)e,k≜umax{Ge,k} represents the MRC beamformer employed by Eve during the first phase, Ge,k≜Hie,k(Hie,k)H , and the term cin,kHvik appears as a result of IMCI and we also readily assume that all the NM macro users, within on SCk , are allocated the same power pM,k .

As mentioned above, in Phase II, while the relaying user Ui1,k forwards the re-encoded common stream si,ck by employing a codebook different from that of UAVi to Ui2,k at a power level 0≤pR≤P¯R , UAVi transmits the AN at a power of 0≤pJ≤P¯J . Given the limited power budget P¯(2) in Phase II, i.e. 0≤pR+pJ≤P¯(2) , it should be optimally shared between the Tx Ui1,k and the jammer UAVi for further enhancing the secrecy performance. For AN transmission, we use the estimated channel coefficients and then the MRT-based beamformer p^z≜vmax{G^He,k} , where G^He,k≜(H^ie,k)HH^ie,k , is adopted by UAVi to focus the AN z on the Eve .5 Accordingly, the signals received by Ui1,k and Eve in Phase II, are respectively written as follows:
yi2,k(2)=yie,k(2)=pR−−√fi2,kHsi,ck+pj−−√hi2,kHp^zz+pM,k−−−−√cM,i2,kHvik+zi2,k(2),w(2)e,kH(pR−−√fie,kHsi,ck+pj−−√Hie,kp^zz +pM,k−−−−√CM,i2,kHvik+zie,k(2)),(10)(11)
View Sourcewhere w(2)e,k≜fie,kH∥∥fie,k∥∥ is the MRC beamformer employed by Eve during the second phase, zie,k(2)∼CN(0,δ2INe) , and zi2,k(m)∣∣2m=1∼CN(0,δ2) represent the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN).

The corresponding capacity achieved by each of Ui1,k , Ui2,k , and Eve is determined by their SINR values in both phases. To do so, we should point out that in Phase I, both Ui1,k and Ui2,k first detects si,ck , while treating the other streams as interference. Then, si,ck is eliminated via the SIC and each of Ui1,k , Ui2,k can detect the corresponding private streams, while treating the irrelevant private streams as noise. As for Eve , we should note that a persistent Eve may succeed in stealing the codebooks and extract the private messages. So, an interesting PLS approach is to degrade the ability of Eve to detect the common stream at an earlier stage so that si,ck behaves as AN at Eve .

Given the above model, for each n∈{1,2,e} we first let γi,c(1)n,k and γi,c(2)n,k respectively represent the received SINR values of users during detecting the common stream in both phases and γi,pn,k represents the SINR values at the legitimate users, when detecting the private streams. We also assume \gamma _{e,n,k}^{i,p} to be the SINR at Eve when eavesdropping on the associated private stream of U_{n,k}^{i} , while treating the private steam of other user \left.{U_{j,k}^{i}}\right |_{j{~{\neq }}n} as interference. The corresponding capacity parameters are defined by simply replacing \gamma with C , leading to the achievable capacity corresponding to the SINRs, respectively, which are denoted by {C_{n,k}^{i,c}}^{(1) } , {C_{n,k}^{i,c}}^{(2) } , {C_{n,k}^{i,p}} , {C_{e,n,k}^{i,p}} . Subsequently, the corresponding capacity achieved by the legitimate users and Eve are respectively formulated as follows:\begin{align*} {C_{n,k}^{i,c}}^{(1) }\triangleq&\theta \log _{2}\left ({1+{\gamma _{n,k}^{i,c}}{}^{(1) }}\right),\quad \forall \,n{~{\in }}{\left \{{ 1,2,e}\right \} } \tag{12}\\ {C_{n,k}^{i,c}}^{(2) }\triangleq&(1-\theta)\log _{2}\left ({1+{\gamma _{n,k}^{i,c}}{}^{(2) }}\right),\quad \forall \,n{~{\in }}{\left \{{ 2,e}\right \} } \tag{13}\\ C_{u,k}^{i,c}\triangleq&\textrm {min}\left \{{\underset {{C_{1,k}^{i,c}}}{\underbrace {{C_{1,k}^{i,c}}^{(1) }}},\underset {{C_{2,k}^{i,c}}}{\underbrace {{C_{2,k}^{i,c}}^{(1) }+{C_{2,k}^{i,c}}^{(2) }}}}\right \}, \tag{14}\\ {C_{e,k}^{i,c}}\triangleq&{C_{e,k}^{i,c}}^{(1) }+{C_{e,k}^{i,c}}^{(2) }, \tag{15}\\ C_{n,k}^{i,p}\triangleq&\theta \log _{2}\left ({1+{\gamma _{n,k}^{i,p}}}\right),\,C_{e,n,k}^{i,p}\triangleq \theta \log _{2}\left ({1+{\gamma _{e,n,k}^{i,p}}}\right), \\{}\tag{16}\end{align*}
View Source\forall \,n{~{\in }}{\left \{{ 1,2}\right \} } where C_{u,k}^{i,c} and {C_{e,k}^{i,c}} , respectively, stand for the information capacity achieved by the legitimate users and Eve in detecting s_{k}^{i,c} during the two phases. Note that, C_{u,k}^{i,c} is limited by the achievable capacity of the worst-case user, i.e. the one having the lowest capacity during the two phases and Eve tries to improve the decodability of s_{k}^{c} by exploiting the achievable capacities of both phases, as shown in (15). Additionally, {C_{n,k}^{i,c}} represents the information capacity achieved by each of U_{1,k}^{i} , U_{2,k}^{i} in detecting their corresponding private streams. Furthermore, C_{e,n,k}^{i,p} denotes the capacity achieved by Eve in her attempt to detect the private stream, belonging to each legitimate user. In this case, it should be observed that, in contrast to the detection process of the private streams at U_{1,k}^{i} and U_{2,k}^{i} , when Eve attempts to extract the associated private message of each user, the common stream s_{k}^{i,c} is taken into account as interference. Similarly, the other user’s private stream also acts as interference.

B. Achievable Information Rate
In order to determine the estimated SINR values, the actual channel parameters {\mathbf {h}_{n,k}^{i}} , {{\mathbf {f}}_{e,k}^{i}} , and f_{2,k}^{i} in (17)–(22) can be readily substituted by their estimated counterparts of {\hat {\mathbf {h}}_{n,k}^{i}}=\mathrm {PL}_{n.k}^{i}\,\hat {\mathbf {n}}_{n,k}^{i} , {{\hat {\mathbf {f}}_{e,k}^{i}}} , \hat {f}_{2,k}^{i} , resulting in the estimated SINR values \hat {\gamma }_{n,k}^{i\text {,c}}{}^{(1) } , \hat {\gamma }_{n,k}^{i\text {,c}}{}^{(2) } , \hat {\gamma }_{n,k}^{i\text {,p}} , \hat {\gamma }_{e,n,k}^{i\text {,p}} .

Remark 2:
Given the CSI uncertainty, the link’s Outage Probability (OP) might be increased. As a result the EST criterion, which is a function of both the Achievable Information Rate (AIR) as well as of the Non-zero OP (NOP), is considered.

Then, the Estimated Achievable Information Rate (EAIR6) corresponding to each legitimate user as well as Eve , (the achievable capacities from the Tx viewpoint), can be written as:\begin{align*} {\hat {R}_{n,k}^{i,c}}{}^{(1) }=&\theta \log _{2}\left ({1+{{\hat {\gamma }}_{n,k}^{i\text {,c}}}{}^{(1) }}\right),\quad \forall \,n\in {\left \{{ 1,2,e}\right \} } \tag{23}\\ {\hat {R}_{n,k}^{i,c}}{}^{(2) }=&\left ({1-\theta }\right)\log _{2}\left ({1+{{\hat {\gamma }}_{n,k}^{i\text {,c}}}{}^{(2) }}\right),\quad \forall \,n\in {\left \{{ 2,e}\right \} } \tag{24}\\ {\hat {R}_{u,k}^{i,c}}=&\left ({1-\epsilon _{out}^{max}}\right)\min \left \{{ \underset {{\hat {R}_{1,k}^{i,c}}}{\underbrace {{\hat {R}_{1,k}^{i,c}}{}^{(1) }}},\underset {{\hat {R}_{2,k}^{i,c}}}{\underbrace {{\hat {R}_{2,k}^{i,c}}{}^{(1) }+{\hat {R}_{2,k}^{i,c}}{}^{(2) }}}}\right \}, \\{}\tag{25}\\ {\hat {R}_{e,k}^{i,c}}\triangleq&{\hat {R}_{e,k}^{i,c}}{}^{(1) }+{\hat {R}_{e,k}^{i,c}}{}^{(2) }, \tag{26}\\ {\hat {R}_{n,k}^{i,p}}=&\left ({1-\epsilon _{out}^{max}}\right)\theta \log _{2}\left ({1+{\hat {\gamma }_{n,k}^{i,p}}}\right), \\&\forall \,n\in {\left \{{ 1,2}\right \} }\tag{27}\\ {\hat {R}_{e,n,k}^{i,p}}=&\theta \log _{2}\left ({1+{\hat {\gamma }_{e,n,k}^{i,p}}}\right),\quad \forall \,n\in {\left \{{ 1,2}\right \} }, \tag{28}\end{align*}

The derivation of {\hat {R}_{u,k}^{i,c}} in (25) is presented in Appendix A and the parameter \epsilon _{out}^{max} therein stands for the maximum tolerable OP. Furthermore, {\hat {R}_{n,k}^{i,p}} in (27) (See Appendix A for proof) denotes the EST of the intended private streams corresponding to each legitimate link, while {\hat {R}_{e,n,k}^{i,p}} represents the EAIR of the private streams corresponding to Eve ’s link.

Remark 3 (Secrecy Policy):
Observe from (22) that the performance of Eve in detecting the private message is corrupted by the common stream since Eve was unable to detect it. This is achieved by designing the RS precoder so that even the best channel capacity that may achieved by Eve fails to support the minimum required common transmission rate, i.e. {{r_{k}^{i,c}\geq \max \limits_{\triangle \mathbf {f}_{e,k}^{i},\mathbf {\Delta n}_{n,k}^{i}}}{C_{e,k}^{i,c}}} . In the meantime, we also expect that r_{k}^{i,c}\leq {\hat {R}_{u,k}^{i,c}} is satisfied for ensuring that the common stream can be detected at both legitimate users.

It should be emphasized that, we assume the worst-case scenario in the sense of security, where imperfect CSIT is assumed at the legitimate transmitter and both legitimate users adjust their strategy based on the estimated channel coefficients. So, the actual total ASR between UAV_{i} and each legitimate user, defined as the sum of the ASR values due to the common and private streams, is given by:\begin{align*} R_{sec,n,k}^{i,tot}\triangleq&R_{sec,n,k}^{i,c}+R_{sec,n,k}^{i,p},\quad \forall \,n\in \left \{{ 1,2}\right \} \\ R_{sec,n,k}^{i,c}\triangleq&\alpha _{n,k}^{i}\left [{\hat {R}_{u,k}^{i,c}-C_{e,k}^{i,c}}\right]^{+}, \\ R_{sec,n,k}^{i,p}\triangleq&\left [{\hat {R}_{n,k}^{i,p}-C_{e,n,k}^{i,p}}\right]^{+}\tag{29}\end{align*}
View Sourcewhere we define the operation \left [{x}\right]^{+}\triangleq \max \left ({0,x}\right) . The weighting factors \left.{\alpha _{n,k}^{i}}\right |_{n=1}^{2}\in \left [{0,1}\right] associated with \alpha _{1,k}^{i}+\alpha _{2,k}^{i}=1 allow us to fine-tune the significance of the portion of each user in the overall secrecy rate enhancement. Although in [29] this coefficient is simply assumed as a constant, Here we optimize it with the aim of maximizing the ASR of the system.

Remark 4 (WCSR-CSI-Errors):
Under imperfect CSIT assumption, the estimated MRT beamformer \hat {\mathbf {p}}_{z} no longer performs at its best and some AN is leaked towards U_{2,k}^{i} , as well. To alleviate this deleterious impact and guarantee a robust design against such imperfections, we will aim for maximizing the Worst-Case Secrecy Rate (WCSR), i.e. maximizing the minimum ASR over all possible CSI uncertainties.

SECTION IV.Proposed Robust WCSR Maximization
A. Problem Formulation
To establish secrecy-rate fairness among the legitimate users, we aim for maximizing the WCSR among all legitimate users (WCSR-Fairness). It should also be remarked that, to prevent outage of legitimate links due to imperfect CSIT, transmission of common and private streams during two cooperative phases must be protected and thus, considering the following OP constraints \forall n\in {\left \{{ 1,2}\right \} } is of vital importance:\begin{align*}&\mathbb {P}\left \{{ {\hat {R}_{n,k}^{i,c}}{}^{(1) }\geq {C_{n,k}^{i,c}}{}^{(1) }}\right \} \leq \epsilon _{out}^{max},\,\,(a) \\&\mathbb {P}\left \{{ {\hat {R}_{2,k}^{i,c}}{}^{(2) }\geq {C_{2,k}^{i,c}}{}^{(2) }}\right \} \leq \epsilon _{out}^{max}\,\,(b), \\&\mathbb {P}\left \{{ {\hat {R}_{n,k}^{i,p}}\geq {C_{n,k}^{i,p}}}\right \} \leq \epsilon _{out}^{max},\,\,(c).\tag{30}\end{align*}
View Source

Based on the above discussions, the optimization problem of the RS-based downlink in UAV cells is formulated as:\begin{align*}&\underset {\mathbf {P}_{k}^{i},\theta,\mathbf {P},\boldsymbol {\alpha }_{n,k}^{i}}{\max }\left ({\underset {n\in {\left \{{ 1,2}\right \} }}{\min }\left ({\begin{array}{cc} {{\underset {{\triangle \mathbf {f}_{e,k}^{i},\mathbf {\mathrm {\Delta }n}_{n,k}^{i}}}{\min }}} & \left \{{ R_{sec,n,k}^{i,tot}}\right \} \end{array}}\right)}\right)\,\, \\&\hspace {-2pc}\text {s.t.} \\&C_{1}\!: r_{k}^{i,c}\leq {\hat {R}_{u,k}^{i,c}},\qquad C_{2}\!: r_{k}^{i,c}\geq {\underset {{{{\triangle \mathbf {f}_{e,k}^{i},\mathbf {\mathrm {\Delta }n}_{n,k}^{i}}}}}{\max }}{C_{e,k}^{i,c}}, \\&C_{3}\!: (2), (30), \qquad C_{4}\!: \sum _{i=1}^{I} p_{k}^{i}\left \Vert{ \mathbf {h}_{i,k}^{M}}\right \Vert ^{2}\leq I_{k}^{i},\quad \forall k, \\&C_{5}\!: 0\leq \alpha _{n,k}^{i}\leq 1,\qquad C_{6}\!: \alpha _{1,k}^{i}+\alpha _{2,k}^{i}=1,\quad \forall \,i,k \\&C_{7}\!: 0\le p_{R}\le \bar {P}_{R}\qquad C_{8}\!: 0\le p_{J}\le \bar {P}_{J} \\&C_{9}\!: 0\le \mathbf {P}^{T}.\mathbf {1}_{2}\le \bar {P}^{(2) }\tag{31}\end{align*}
View Sourcewhere p_{k}^{i}\triangleq Tr(\mathbf {P}_{k}^{i}{\mathbf {P}_{k}^{i}}^{H}) , \boldsymbol {\alpha }_{n,k}^{i}\triangleq \left [{\alpha _{1,k}^{i},\alpha _{2,k}^{i}}\right]^{T} , \mathbf {1}_{2}\triangleq \left [{1,1}\right]^{T} , \mathbf {P}\triangleq \left [{p_{R},p_{J}}\right]^{T} .

Based on the constraint (31-C_{4} ), it should be emphasized that, as the macro users have higher priority in using the spectrum, we expect that the IMCI power contaminating each macro user is kept below the maximum tolerable interference level I_{k} . This is stipulated in (31-C_{4} ), where \mathbf {h}_{i,k}^{M} represents the corresponding CSI between UAV_{i} and the M -th macro user under SC_{k} . We also note that, the constraints (30) lead to a challenging optimization problem. As an alternative approach, we consider the specific scenario for these constraints in which no outage will occur at all. In other words, it is expected that the minimum capacities achieved by the legitimate links are indeed able to support the specific AIR from the Tx point of view in which the OP will become zero, i.e. \epsilon _{out}^{max}=0 . This can be expressed as:\begin{align*}&\underset {\mathbf {\Delta n}_{n,k}^{i}}{\min }\left \{{ {C_{n,k}^{i,c}}{}^{(1) }}\right \} \geq \left.{{\hat {R}_{n,k}^{i,c}}{}^{(1) }}\right |_{\epsilon _{out}^{max}=0},\quad \forall \,n\in {\left \{{ 1,2}\right \} } \\&\underset {\triangle \mathbf {f}_{e,k}^{i},\mathbf {\mathrm {\Delta }n}_{n,k}^{i}}{\min }\left \{{ {C_{2,k}^{i,c}}{}^{(2) }}\right \} \geq \left.{{\hat {R}_{2,k}^{i,c}}{}^{(2) }}\right |_{\epsilon _{out}^{max}=0}, \\&\underset {\mathbf {\Delta n}_{n,k}^{i}}{\min }\left \{{ {C_{n,k}^{i,p}}}\right \} \geq \left.{\hat {R}_{n,k}^{i,p}}\right |_{\epsilon _{out}^{max}=0},\quad \forall \,n\in {\left \{{ 1,2}\right \} }.\tag{32}\end{align*}

The problem (31) is still hard to solve because of the non-convex objective function (OF) as well as the non-convex constraint set. Therefore, finding the global optimum is computationally inefficient or might even be intractable, hence finding a local optimum is more sensible in practice. To circumvent the non-convexity, we resort to using SPCA. Accordingly, the problem is approximated iteratively by a sequence of convex programs. At each iteration, the non-convex constraints are surrogated by their corresponding convex approximation counterparts.

B. SPCA-Based Solution
In order to utilize SPCA, we first aim for eliminating the non-convexity by variable transformations and linearization for reformulating the problem. Then, a well-suited convex subset is constructed via SPCA that approximates the original non-convex solution set. More explicitly, we adopt an iterative solution for dealing with the non-convexity by approximating the non-convex factor at each iteration by its first order Taylor expansion. Given this perspective, in what follows, we deal with each non-convex part independently to acquire its equivalent convex counterpart.

1) Non-Convex of Together With Constraint (31-C_{{1}} ):
Observing the max-min problem (31), we first aim for eliminating the inner maximizations, which are actually constituted by a pair of consecutive searches over the legitimate values of uncertainties to find the worst-case and thus can be merged together as \min \left \{{ R_{sec,1,k}^{i,tot},R_{sec,2,k}^{i,tot}}\right \} . To do so, we introduce the auxiliary variable r_{sec} and reformulate the OF, together with the first constraint of (31) as follows:\begin{align*}&\underset {\mathbf {P}_{k}^{i},\theta,\mathbf {P},\boldsymbol {\alpha }_{n,k}^{i}}{\max } \quad r_{sec} \\&\hspace {-2pc}\text {s.t.} \\&C_{1}\!: \alpha _{n,k}^{i}\left [{\underset {\hat {R}_{u,k}^{i,c}}{\underbrace {\min \left \{{ {\hat {R}_{1,k}^{i,c}},{\hat {R}_{2,k}^{i,c}}}\right \} }}-C_{e,k}^{i,c}}\right]^{+}+ \\&\qquad \left [{\hat {R}_{n,k}^{i,p}-C_{e,n,k}^{i,p}}\right]^{+}\geq r_{sec}\quad \forall \,n\in {\left \{{ 1,2}\right \} } \\&C_{2}\!: \min \left \{{ {\hat {R}_{1,k}^{i,c}},{\hat {R}_{2,k}^{i,c}}}\right \} \geq r_{k}^{i,c}.\tag{33}\end{align*}
View Source

Upon observing (33), it can be perceived that r_{sec} plays the role of lower bound for \min \left \{{ R_{sec,1,k}^{i,tot},R_{sec,2,k}^{i,tot}}\right \} and its maximization will increase the left-side of the constraints C_{1} , so that it would be active at the optimum. We note that to arrive at (33), R_{sec,n,k}^{i,tot} and \hat {R}_{u,k}^{i,c} in (33-C_{1} ) were respectively substituted by their definitions from (29) and (25). Furthermore, constraint C_{2} arises by inserting the definition of \hat {R}_{u,k}^{i,c} from (25) into (31-C_{1} ).

Due to the operator \left [{.}\right]^{+} , the constraint (33-C_{1} ) is non-convex. To relax the problem and to cope with non-convexity, we introduce two extra artificial constraints in (34-C_{7} ), (34-C_{8} ) and remove this operator. To eliminate the min function in (33-C_{2} ) we split it into two extra constraints in (34-C_{2} ). Furthermore, in order to facilitate the procedure of convexifying (33), we further define two sets of new auxiliary variables {\boldsymbol{\alpha }}_{p}\triangleq \left [{\alpha _{p,1},\alpha _{p,2},\alpha _{1,e},\alpha _{2,e}}\right] and {\boldsymbol{\alpha }}_{c}\triangleq \left [{\alpha _{c,1},\alpha _{c,2},\alpha _{c,e}}\right] . This allows us to transform (33), \forall \,n\in {\left \{{ 1,2}\right \} } into:\begin{align*}&\underset {{\mathbf {P}_{k}^{i}},\boldsymbol {\alpha }_{n,k}^{i},{\boldsymbol{\alpha }}_{p},{\boldsymbol{\alpha }}_{c}}{\max } \quad r_{sec} \\&\hspace {-2pc}\text {s.t.} \\&C_{1}\!: \alpha _{n,k}^{i}\left ({\gamma _{c}-\alpha _{c,e}}\right)+\alpha _{p,n}-\alpha _{n,e}\geq r_{sec}, \\&C_{2}\!: \gamma _{c}\geq r_{k}^{i,c},\alpha _{c,n}\geq \gamma _{c},\qquad C_{3}\!: \hat {R}_{n,k}^{i,p}\geq \alpha _{p,n}, \\&C_{4}\!: \hat {R}_{n,k}^{i,c}\geq \alpha _{c,n},\qquad C_{5}\!: C_{e,n,k}^{i,p}\leq \alpha _{n,e}, \\&C_{6}\!: C_{e,k}^{i,c}\leq \alpha _{c,e},\qquad C_{7}\!: \alpha _{c,n}\geq \alpha _{c,e},\alpha _{p,n}\geq \alpha _{n,e}, \\{}\tag{34}\end{align*}
View Source

Based on the above discussion, \alpha _{p,n} and \alpha _{c,n} can respectively represent the lower-bound of \hat {R}_{n,k}^{i,p} and \hat {R}_{n,k}^{i,c} , whilst \alpha _{n,e} and \alpha _{c,e} stand as the upper-bounds of C_{e,n,k}^{i,p} and C_{e,k}^{i,c} , respectively. Increasing the lower-bound values and simultaneously reducing the upper-bounds will boost the left-side of the constraints, which is needed here, so that the constraints (34-C_{1}:C_{6} ) would be active at the optimum.

Despite this linearization, it can be seen by invoking the definitions of \hat {R}_{n,k}^{i,p} , \hat {R}_{e,n,k}^{i,p} , C_{e,n,k}^{i,p} , C_{e,k}^{i,c} that the constraints (34-C_{1},C_{3}:C_{6} ) are still non-convex. To handle the non-convexity of these constraints we construct a suitable inner convex subset for approximating the non-convex feasible solution set. Along this line, we first approximate (34-C_{1} ) by its linear Taylor expansion to obtain \varTheta ^{[m]}\left ({\alpha _{n,k}^{i},\gamma _{c}}\right) -\bar {\varTheta }^{[m]}\left ({\alpha _{n,k}^{i},\alpha _{c,e}}\right)+ \alpha _{p,n}- \alpha _{n,e} \geq t_{sec} , where we have defined \varTheta ^{[m]}\left ({x,y}\right)\triangleq \frac {1}{2}(x^{[m]}+y^{[m]}) \left ({x+y}\right) -\frac {1}{4}(x^{[m]}+y^{[m]})^{2} -\frac {1}{4}(x-y)^{2} , and \bar {\varTheta }^{[m]}\left ({x,y}\right)\triangleq \frac {1}{4}(x+y)^{2}+ \frac {1}{4}(x^{[m]}-y^{[m]})^{2} -\frac {1}{2}(x^{[m]}-y^{[m]}) \left ({x-y}\right) for the linear approximation of the terms, which are the product of two variables.

Next, in order to handle the constraints (34-C_{3} :C_{6} ), we first define four sets of new auxiliary variables \mathbf {{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}_{c}=\left [{\beta _{c,1}^{(1) },\beta _{c,2}^{(1) },\beta _{c,2}^{(2) },\beta _{c,e}^{(1) },\beta _{c,e}^{(2) }}\right] , {{\boldsymbol{\rho }}}_{c}=\left [{\rho _{c,1}^{(1) },\rho _{c,2}^{(1) },\rho _{c,2}^{(2) },\rho _{c,e}^{(1) },\rho _{c,e}^{(2) }}\right] , \mathbf {{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}_{p}=\left [{\beta _{p,1},\beta _{p,2},\beta _{1,e},\beta _{2,e}}\right] , {{\boldsymbol{\rho }}}_{p}=\left [{\rho _{p,1},\rho _{p,2},\rho _{1,e},\rho _{2,e}}\right] and exploit the following lemmas.

To handle the non-convexity of (31-C_{2} ), we first introduce the new auxiliary variables of \boldsymbol {\pi }_{c,e}\triangleq \left [{{u_{1,c,e},u_{1,c,e},v_{c,e},x_{c,e},y_{c,e},d_{c,e},f_{c,e}}}\right] and formulate Lemma 9, as follows:

Lemma 5:
The affine approximation of constraint (31-C_{2} ) is given by:\begin{align*} \begin{cases} {(\textrm {I})\!:{~{{\alpha _{c,e}\le }}}\,r_{k}^{i,c},} \\ {(\textrm {II})\!:{\sum _{n=1}^{2} u_{n,c,e}}+p_{M,k}\left \Vert{ \left ({{\hat {\mathbf {w}}_{e,k}^{(1) }}}\right)^{H}\mathbf {C}_{e,k}^{M,i}}\right \Vert ^{2}+\delta ^{2}\geq d_{c,e},} \\ {(\textrm {III})\!:\dfrac {x_{c,e}^{2}}{d_{c,e}}\leq \rho _{c,e}^{(1) },\,} \\ {(\textrm {IV})\!:v_{c,e}+p_{M,k}\left \Vert{ {\left ({\hat {\mathbf {w}}_{e,k}^{(2) }}\right)}^{H}\mathbf {C}_{e,k}^{M,i}}\right \Vert ^{2}+\delta ^{2}\geq f_{c,e},} \\ {(\textrm {V})\!:\dfrac {\delta _{R}^{2}}{f_{c,e}}\leq \rho _{c,e}^{(2) },} \\ {(\textrm {VI})\!:\left |{\left ({{\hat {\mathbf {h}}_{e,k}^{\left ({1}\right)}}}\right)^{H}\mathbf {p}_{k}^{i,c}}\right |+\sqrt {N_{e}N_{t}}\xi \left \Vert{ \mathbf {p}_{k}^{i,c}}\right \Vert _{2}\leq x_{c,e}\,} \\ {(\textrm {VII})\!:Tr\left [{\left ({\mathbf {Q}_{e,k}^{\left ({1}\right)}-\mu _{e}\mathbf {I}}\right)\mathbf {P}_{n,k}^{i,p}}\right]\geq u_{n,c,e},} \\[1.5mm] {(\textrm {VIII})\!:p_{j}Tr\left [{\left ({\mathbf {Q}_{e,k}^{\left ({2}\right)}-\mu _{e}\mathbf {I}}\right)\hat {\mathbf {P}}_{z}}\right]\geq v_{c,e},} \end{cases} \!\!\!\! \\{}\tag{39}\end{align*}

3) Non-Convex Constraint (31-C_{{3}} )
Similar to the above statements, to handle the non-convexity of (31-C_{3} ), we have introduced new auxiliary constraints, corresponding to each constraint. In this regard, we introduce new collections of auxiliary variables \boldsymbol {\pi }_{p,n}\triangleq \left [{\gamma _{p,n},t_{p,n},\omega _{p,j},v_{j,p,n}}\right] and \boldsymbol {\pi }_{c,n}^{(1) }\triangleq \left [{f_{c,n},g_{c,n},x_{c,n}^{(1) },d_{c,n}^{(1) },\gamma _{c,n}^{(1) }}\right] , \boldsymbol {\pi }_{c,n}^{(1) }\triangleq \left [{x_{c,n}^{(2) },d_{c,n}^{(2) },\gamma _{c,n}^{(2) }}\right] that are used in the following lemmas.

Proof:
Following the same approach we presented in Appendix E, Lemma 12 can be proved.

SECTION V.Overall Proposed SPCA-Based Algorithm
Given the above approximations, the proposed SPCA-based procedure is summarized in Algorithm 1, where the convex approximation program (43) is solved at the m -th iteration using standard numerical optimization packages, like CVX [42]. If there exists feasible initial points for (43), the feasible set defined by the constraints of (43) and the consequently resultant solutions definitely fall within the original feasible set defined by (31 - C_{1}:C_{9} ). The procedure continues, unless the stopping criterion is satisfied or the pre-determined number of iterations is exhausted:\begin{align*}&\underset {\mathbf {x}}{\max } \quad r_{sec} \\&\hspace {-2pc}\text {s.t.} \\&\qquad (34-(C_{1}\!:C_{2})),\,(34-C_{7}), \\&\qquad (35)\!:(42),\,(32-(C_{4}\!:C_{6})),\,\boldsymbol {\varpi }\succeq 0,\tag{43}\end{align*}
View Sourcewhere \boldsymbol {\varpi }\triangleq [\gamma _{c},\boldsymbol {\alpha }_{p},\boldsymbol {\alpha }_{c},\boldsymbol {\beta }_{c},\boldsymbol {\beta }_{p},\boldsymbol {\rho }_{c},\boldsymbol {\rho }_{p},\boldsymbol {\pi }_{c,e},\boldsymbol {\pi }_{p,n},\boldsymbol {\pi }_{c,n}] and \mathbf {x}\triangleq [\mathbf {P}_{k}^{i},\boldsymbol {\alpha }_{k}^{i},\boldsymbol {\varpi }] . Note that, if Algorithm 1 is initialized with random points, it may fail at the very beginning, because of infeasibility. To circumvent this issue, we now conceive a Feasible Initial Point Search Algorithm (FIPSA) in Algorithm 2. In this regard, we aim for minimizing an infeasibility indicator parameter s>0 , to flag up any violation of the constraints of (43). Hence we have to rewrite all the 16 constraints of problem (37) in the form of \left.{\mathcal {{\,\,{{\mathscr {G}}}}}_{i}\left ({\mathbf {x}}\right)}\right |_{i=1}^{16}\le s , where \mathcal {{~{{\mathscr {G}}}}}_{i}\left ({\mathbf {x}}\right) stands for the reshaped format of the i -th constraint and all the terms at the left-side of the less than or equal to zero. Then we reformulate the feasibility problem as follows:\begin{align*}&\underset {\mathbf {x}}{\min } \quad s \\&\text {s.t.}\quad \left.{\mathcal {{~{{\mathscr {G}}}}}_{i}\left ({\mathbf {x}}\right)}\right |_{i=1}^{16}{~{\le }}s.\tag{44}\end{align*}

This approach has been previously proposed in [7] and [34] as a low-complexity scheme for finding the feasible initial points. Overall, the proposed FIPSA Algorithm 2 runs at the first step and then the Initial Points (IP)s calculated are fed to Algorithm 1. Algorithm 2 commences with random IPs and the algorithm is halted if either the stopping criterion is satisfied or the maximum number of affordable iterations is reached. We remark that, if at the m -th iteration the current OF s is zero, the algorithm stops even though the stopping criterion is not satisfied. Before starting communications, based on the instantaneous CSIs and QoS of mobile-users, which are collected by the macro-BS, the locations of the hovering UAVs are determined through backhaul links for each specific time-frame. During this period of time, the proposed algorithm is executed and both the RS-precoder as well as the other resources are optimized for each UAV-cell based on the instantaneous CSIs. After completing each time-frame, the BS relocates the UAVs in accordance with the available knowledge. Each UAV prefers to exchange its location with its neighboring UAVs. The process of relocating the UAVs after each time frame, is reminiscent of the hand-over procedure of cellular networks, but these mobility issues are beyond the scope of the current paper.

SECTION VI.Simulation Results
In this section, we present numerical results for characterizing our proposed framework. Our simulation settings are based on the following adjustment unless otherwise stated. The BS is arranged at the center point with R_{BS}=1000\,\textrm {m} for the macrocell radius, where N_{M}=5 macro users are randomly distributed around the BS for receiving downlink signals from it. In the scenario investigated several UAVs randomly move over the users and hover to provide communication services. Explicitly, I=4 UAVs are randomly distributed within the macro cell and they have a coverage radius of R_{UAV}=350\,\textrm {m} and altitude of H_{i}=150\,\textrm {m} . Furthermore, N legitimate users request services in each UAV cell. Each UAV has a minimum distance constraint from the ground BS to ensure that the UAV can serve users also at the edge of the macrocell with K=10 sub-channels. Furthermore, enough users are randomly located within the coverage of each UAV, two legitimate user per each sub-channel SC_{k} . The total number of UAV users in the simulation ranges from 8 to 20. The minimum distance between the BS and UAV cells is 50\,\textrm {m} on a horizontal plane. In contrast to the channel model spanning from the macro BS to users, the path loss model in the UAV network includes both LOS and NLOS links associated with the path-loss exponents \mathcal {L}_{n,k}^{i}=2 and \mathcal {N}_{n,k}^{i}=3.5 , respectively. We assume that the channel gain of U_{1,k}^{i} is stronger than that of U_{2,k}^{i} . The simulation results are averaged over 500 realizations of the proposed scheme. Moreover, we set N_{max}=M_{max}=20 and the maximum tolerable threshold value is set to \delta _{I}=10^{-2} . The power of the macro BS is p_{M,k}=20\,\,\textrm {dBm} for each sub-carrier. A channel estimation error with variance of \zeta =10^{-3} is assumed and the additive noise at the receiver is considered to have a normalized power of \delta ^{2}=0\,\textrm {dBm} , and the minimum required transmission rate of the common stream is r_{k}^{i,c}=1\,\textrm {Bit/sec/Hz} .

Fig. 4 depicts the average convergence of the FIPSA algorithm using the OF value of (44) versus the number of iterations for different values of UAV transmission power \bar {P}_{UAV}^{i} . As observed, the average convergence of the FIPSA algorithm is fast, converging at a maximum of five iterations. Interestingly, upon increasing the transmission power the algorithm ’ s convergence rate decreases. This arises from the fact that increasing the transmission power results in higher information leakage to Eve and thus more iterations are required to meet the security constraints of (44).

The average convergence speed of the proposed SPCA-based solution of the problem in (31) is shown in Fig. 5. The results show the convergence of Algorithm 1 at a maximum of 10 iterations. Similar to the convergence behavior of FIPSA, upon increasing the transmit power the algorithm ’ s convergence rate decreases.

Fig. 5 shows the worst-case average secrecy rate achieved by the proposed framework versus the time slot sharing parameter \theta . In this experiment we aim for observing the impact of UAV altitude H_{i} and \theta on the achievable secrecy rate. Interestingly, the OF versus \theta is concave and there is an optimum \theta ^{*} at which the secrecy rate achieved will be maximized. This figure also indicates that the secrecy rate critically depends on the altitude of the UAV and at the optimum (H_{i}^{*} ) we have \theta ^{*}=1 . This indicates that at the optimal altitude the CRS framework is the non-cooperative RS, where no cooperative phase is required. This is because, owing to the LoS links, the quality of the common signal received at cell-edge user is good enough at the optimal altitude. Hence no cooperation is needed for relaying the common stream. Observe in Fig. 6 that, by increasing the altitude and getting away from the optimal altitude, the distances of LoS links to both users will be almost identical and the secrecy rate is reduced due to the increased path-loss. By contrast, upon reducing the UAV altitude from the optimal ones, \theta ^{*} is deceased as well because of the emergence of fading. Hence the common signal received by the cell-edge user is corrupted and reliance on the cooperative phase becomes inevitable.

To reveal the joint impact of the UAV altitude H_{i} and number of TAs N_{t} we have generated Fig. 7. On one hand, as expected, the secrecy rate is boosted by increasing the number of TAs at the UAV, owing to the increased DoF provided for beamforming. On the other hand, as the number of TAs becomes high, the best UAV altitude is decreased, because the extra TAs increase the DoF, hence increasing the LOS probability towards the legitimate users even at low UAV altitudes.

As mentioned in [27], Cooperative RSMA (C-RSMA) encompasses both C-NOMA and C-SDMA as special cases. Thus, upon considering dynamic time slot sharing 0 < \theta < 1 , if no power is allocated to \mathbf {P}_{2,k}^{i,p {}} together with encoding the entire private message of the second user into s_{k}^{i,c} , a C-NOMA scheme is obtained. By contrast, we arrive at C-SDMA by switching off the common stream bearing part of the transmitted signal. Given this perspective, it can be explicitly observed in Fig. 8 that the proposed strategy outperforms both its C-NOMA and C-SDMA counterparts.

For characterizing the robustness of our proposed framework against imperfect CSIT, we have produced Fig. 9 in which the average worst-case secrecy rate is depicted versus the CSIT estimation error \zeta . This experiment was performed for various transmit power budgets \bar {P}_{UAV}^{i} . Observe that regardless of the available power budget the proposed robust framework achieves a similar secrecy rate at \zeta =10^{-2} . By contrast, at a low CSI estimation error of \zeta =10^{-4} a power budget of 40 dBm approximately doubles the secrecy rate.

Finally, Fig. 10 illustrates the WCSR versus the number of transmit antennas for different values of receive antennas at Eve . This figure indicates that increasing the number of transmit antennas at the UAV enhances system’s performance, which is an explicit benefit of the increased DoF provided by the UAV-Tx. On the other hand, upon increasing the number of the receive antennas at Eve , the system’s secrecy performance is degraded due to Eve ’s improved ability to eavesdrop and infer from common message. Interestingly, our proposed scheme still shows considerable robustness against a multiple antenna-aided Eve , hence we can achieve non-zero WCSR.

SECTION VII.Conclusion
In this paper, we conceived robust and secure resource allocation algorithms for UAV-aided MISO-RS HetNets under imperfect CSIT for both the legitimate users and Eve , which was based on the worst-case CSI uncertainty channel model. Our CRS optimization scheme was formulated as a non-convex robust worst-case secrecy rate maximization problem, where the common message was also used for drowning out Eve without any extra transmit power consumption. The objective of the proposed robust design is to maximize the WCSR subject to both link outage and power budget constraints. The resultant non-convex optimization problem was solved using the SPCA method. In order to circumvent any potential infeasibility, we have also proposed an iterative initialization algorithm. Our numerical results have shown the superiority of the proposed framework over both C-NOMA and C-SDMA. More importantly, our solution guarantees the security of the private messages, which is not possible for its NOMA and SDMA counterparts. In our future research we would like to consider sophisticated eavesdroppers having both an arbitrarily high number of antennas [10] as well as the impact of mobility [45].
